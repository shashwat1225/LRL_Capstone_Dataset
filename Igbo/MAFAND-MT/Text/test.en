Oscars 2018: Between Africa and Nigeria
BBC found out that despite that some Nigeria movie producers feature Hollywood stars in their movies, it has not made them to be among those named for winning any award in Hollywood.
Nollywood are those responsible for producing movies in Nigeria and other known African countries. Other African countries have shown them superiority.
Lupita Nyong'o, an American based Kenyan won the award of 'best woman producer' in the year 2013.
Few years ago Nigeria was seen as the hero of movie production in Africa but now, it seems others have surpassed them.
While Nollywood themselves who are in second position in movie production produce over 1000 movies in one year, Hollywood produce less than that number of movies but it does not stop them from being those whom the whole world look up to as the producers of best movies.

Masquerading is one the culture the Igbos are known for.
Group of masquerades who were celebrating the feast of 'Uzo Iyi' at Uke in Idemili North Local Government Area, Anambra state, attacked a Catholic prayer group and destroyed more than thirty vehicles, injured many people. One of the stabbed persons died on Saturday.
The priest in charge of the Catholic prayer group Father Emmanuel Obimma, popularly known as Ebube Muonso, and other priests and ordained women escaped from the youths that attacked those who came to worship God with a vigil from Friday night through to Saturday morning.
The assistant priest Francis Okoye told BBC on phone that the masqueraders attacked the vigil mass by 8pm at night and injured some members of the congregation and destroyed more than thirty vehicles.
Àgùlerì and Igboukwu are not the ancestral home of the Igbos.

After the attack we counted the vehicles they destroyed and they were thirty in number.
They injured so many people.
They stabbed one person who was taken the hospital with a knife.
We don't know yet whether the person is alive or dead.
It is clear that the youths of Uke who did the thing were prepared to persecute the congregation members because when Uzo Iyi is being celebrated, masquerading stops at 6pm but those masquerades attacked the adoration ground by passed 8pm.
They started from beating commercial drivers who were conveying people to church, and collecting their money and their phones.
Masquerades destroyed many vehicles in the adoration ground.

Those who were present at the scene confirmed that the youths of the village were persecuting commercial drivers and the congregation, collecting money, phones and other valuables from them.
Not long ago, they beat Father Obimma's worker that made the priest to complain to police who arrested the youths of the village, although they were released when the King and the elders of the village intervened.

They made the Igbos to understand that it is an empty promise that Igbos will get presidency in 2023 if they support president Buhari to win again in 2019.
Not long ago, some members of APC which include the Minister of Transport , Rotimi Amechi, Secretary to the state government, Boss Mustapha and the Chairman of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, told the Igbos to vote for Buhari in 2019 in order to get their own share in www.

I don't think we should be begging people for presidency.
My view is that we should go and ask God, who knows that if an Igbo emerges as the president that the Fulani, the Yoruba and the different parts of Nigeria will be satisfied because we will restructure the treasury of Nigeria for progress
Talking of 2023 is irrelevant, whoever does that is up to deceiving the Igbos.
On the same hand, the former president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dozie Ikedife, said that the Igbos who were promised presidency did not participate the last time.
He told Sun Newspaper 'The Igbos were promised the same way in the past, we were equally deceived.
If someone deceived you two or three times, once he comes the fourth time, you have to think deeply.
One is tired of this nation.
Ikedife equally added: 'My interest is how Biafra will be actualized through lawful procedure anddialogue.
Recall that in 2015, majority of the Igbos did not vote for Buhari in the election which made him say that he would not treat those who gave him 95% support and those who gave him 5% support the same way, a statement many thought he has fulfilled through his appointments since he assumed leadership.

Wole Soyinka has advised Nigerians
Wole Soyinka, a well known writer, has advised Nigerians to be at alert and not to allow politicians deceive them in the forthcoming 2019 election.
Soyinka, who said this on Sunday in the posthumous birthday ceremony of a well acclaimed lawyer Gani Fawehinmi which took place in Lagos said that democracy is in danger in Nigeria.
He said that those who put Nigeria in her present situation through their policies have again presented themselves as messiah because election is forthcoming, and advised Nigerians to reject old politicians in order to give new age politicians the opportunity to take over power.
Buhari and APC leaders have had discussion.
Wole Soyinka: Comport yourselves and allow an elder to rest.
He said: 'It is not in doubt that democracy is in danger.'
It is not only democracy, our country is in trouble.
I don't think that there was a time in the entire world, most especially in this nation, a time where protection of everything is soured like this.
We all know this.
The question is whether we are seeing it as a redeeming opportunity or are we seeing it as an opportunity to keep doing those things that made our nation a failure?
It is no longer a news how important it is to do the things that will save the unity of our nation Nigeria.
It is surprising that the enemies of democracy who on their own brought in policies that caused our present situation are those who showcase themselves as the messiah that Nigeria look up to, a nation that has twenty million people.

Why didn't Nigerians attend the meeting held in America?
Government of Nigeria have exonerated themselves from the meeting between investors and ministers held in America
Yemi Osibanjo and Abuja
Yemi Osibanjo is among those whose names are in the book for organising the meeting.
So many ambassadors of Nigeria who were expected to be in the meeeting organised by Nigeria embassy in Washington DC in America were not present in the event.
The absence of the government officials made the people hopeful that Nigeria will not get loan from overseas.
Those who were supposed to be present include the vice president Yemi Osibanjo, Minister of finance Kemi Adeosun, Minister of petroleum Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of Agriculture Audu Ogbeh, Minister of technology Ogbonnaya Onu,Minister of Information Lai Mohammed, Minister of Mineral resources Kayode Fayemi and Minister of Commerce Okechukwu Enelamah.

An individual, Sanusi Lamido, the king of Kano and once the governor of central bank of Nigeria, was dissatisfied with the action of the government.
What Sanusi said
Sanusi said that one who supports investing money in Africa should take Nigeria, Ghana, Ruwanda, Kenya, and South Africa.
He went further to say 'Nigeria maybe better than others in trading but an investor may say, instead of investing $500 in Nigeria let him invest $100 in Ghana, $100 in Ruwanda, $100 in Coted'Ivoire to get robust gain.
We went to have a meeting with foreign investors, we were supposed to start by 9 o'clock but started by 10 o'clock.
When I got to that place, they took m to the office of the Nigeria Ambassador.
Those who came for the meeting were there, the Vice president was absent, the Ministers were absent, said Sanusi.
Sanusi said that what they did was not good, because it showed that Nigeria was not yet prepared for what was being talked about.
He said 'You called people to come and hear how trading is done in Nigeria but you did not come. '
This is not how to get people that will invest in Nigeria.
If it were to be Ruwandans that organised this meeting, their president, Paul Kagame would be there telling the people to start coming to Ruwanda.
People lent their voices on social media
The owner of the handle @SegunAndrews agreed to what Sanusi said.
But, the government have denied that it was not how the thing happened.
Lai Mohammed, the Minister of information has sent out message explaining that it was not true that those who were supposed to go for the meeting did not go.
Mohammed explained that the ministers whose names were in this event did not receive invitation to come, or were in Washington DC when this meeting was going on.
He said that the Ministers of Agriculture, electricity and Labour, and Wealth creation did not get invitation despite that they were scheduled to give talk in the meeting.
Minister of Commerce himself went to the meeting of the commonwealth leaders in London with the President.
Minister of Finance was in Washington DC, but she was there for the meeting of world bank and IMF.
He went further to say that Minister of Information and culture got invitation, but he told the organisers of the meeting that he would not make it because of other things.
Lai Mohammed said 'These things showed that it should not be said that the ministers refused to go for the meeting. '

Three things single exchange rate will cause
IMF told Nigeria to harmonize its exchange rate to a single price, while professionals are talking of disadvantages of having more than one exchange price.
Naira
EFCC said that Umar wants ten million naira.
To have a steady exchange rate, IMF has advised Nigeria to harmonize its exchange rate to a single price.
Nigeria has at least five exchange rates: one for petroleum exporters in Nigeria, one for Muslim faithful going for Mecca in Saudi Arabia, one for Christians going for Pilgrimage, another for those studying overseas and one fixed by government.
Property experts Pat Utomi and Uche Uwaleke explained to BBC journalists that it is disadvantageous to have many exchange rates.
These are some of the disadvantages of many exchange rates
It causes soiling of the hands
Pat Utomi explained that it causes favouritism as it gives someone who knows those in charge the opportunity to buy money at a cheaper rate while another who does not have such opportunity but needs the money to import materials for production of goods will not get it.
It is not good for the progress of buying and selling.
Where Abacha's money will go into
Money exchange: Has the exchange of dollar for naira reduced
In his words, Uche Uwaleke gave an analogy saying 'As government exchange rate is N305, if it is sold to someone at that rate, that person may sold it to another at N365, thereby making profit. But if there is a single fixed rate, you cannot resale it.'
It kills the spirit of productivity in a nation.
Uwaleke said that multiple exchange rate causes many to be lazy.
The only thing they will do is to engage in the sale of low exchange, there will be no productivity.
It lowers multiplication of wealth in a nation.
Utomi said 'if people get foreign exchange at cheaper rate to send their children overseas for study, it will make everybody to want to send their children overseas and the schools in our country will suffer.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about stopping them
Ekweremadu hid his wealth
Ekweremadu was again charged for peace in Nigeria.
There are 109 senators, if 108 senators are in Ekweremadu's house now, it means that all of them are in his house.
Remember that the Senate resolved today that security agents should immediately leave the deputy senate president's house, where they attacked him today.
Ekweremadu was blocked from leaving his house this morning, which stopped him from attending today's Senate meeting, where 14 senators defected from APC to PDP.
Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu's spokesperson, told BBC Igbo that it was EFCC that blocked him from leaving his house in Abuja, not DSS as was formerly written by us.
@MrBanksOmishore, Special Assistant to Saraki, this morning wrote the message EFCC sent to Ekweremadu on Twitter.
In that message, EFCC said that they want to probe Ekweremadu for planning to use his position to manipulate carrying out of the country called money laundering in English.
When Saraki entered the Senate building and started plenary, he said that Ekweremadu could not come, and said that they should strive to see that democracy did not die.
Senator Sam Anyanwu said that he was with Ekweremadu yesterday but he did not get a warrant of being wanted by the police.
After the plenary, the senators resolved that the security agents should leave the house of the Deputy Senate President to enable him utilize the authority due to him.
This morning, Saraki is among those blocked from leaving their houses.

Court has given order to hang the criminals.
High court in Makurdi, Benue state, have decided to hang two people, Hartuna Idi and Suleiman Gina, who are the remnant of those who kidnapped and killed Father John Adeyi till they died for what they committed.
Remember that four kidnappers which include Saidu Abdullahi and Aliyu Garba kidnapped Father Adeyi, the Vicar-General of Catholic church in Otukpo Diocese, Benue state, killed him and dumped his corpse in a farm near Otukpo in 2016.
What I experienced from kidnappers.
Mikel Obi's father has been redeemed from kidnappers again.
But the police later arrested four of them, they confessed that they collected N1.7m ransom but they shot him to death when they heard that the villagers were coming to redeem him from their captivity.
One of them confessed that he was the one that shot him to death. The remaining two were sentenced to death today being Wednesday.
In the message the family of the priest sent to Daily Post, they expressed their gratitude that at the end they got justice.
But they grieved that the judgement reminded them of the murder of Adeyi, who was a professor.

APC pay for their autocratic leadership--Expert
There is a spirit living in a child that is born with dreads.
What the Igbo culture said about dreads in the ancient time and views about it presently.
In the ancient time, Igbo believed that people with dreads could do magic.
The cry of a new born baby in every house brings happiness to the heart of everyone
But there are some places in Igbo land where a new born baby with dreads may bring fear.
In a place like Igbuzo (Ibusa) in Delta state, where the people see children with dreads as special people
Who is someone with dreads?
Some stories said that a new born baby with dreads is because its mother prayed to one spirit living on earth to give her a child.
Will you have the type of circumcision had in the ancient time?
Do you know the God the Igbos worshipped in the ancient time?
They believe that dreads is a mark given to the child for recognition
They call the children child-king
They believe that their dreads is their crown.
As they believe, a child with dreads will do wonderfully well in life because his God is strongly by him, they are quite strong, and they grow to be brave that cause terror in time of war.
But many problems accompany those that carry dreadsmen.
It is difficult to take very good care of dreads.
Dreads goes acredness
Many of the villagers believe that a child with dreads encounters many sicknesses or dies when a comb goes into the dreads.
It is an abomination to touch the hair of someone with dreads.
Whoever does something like this shall give the child money immediately or tie a Cowrie on the hair.
It is only this that will stop the child from falling sseverely ill.
It is only the mother of the child that can touch the dreads.
The tradition of cutting dreads
Story has it that it is only herbalists can cut the hair of a child with dreads.
Now celebrities and so many other people use dreads for fashion.
The must have grown and be talking.
His/her family will ask him/her what he/she wants as a gift item to cut the dreads.
Whatever he/she wants that day is what they will give him/her.
Christianity
The whole Igbo land is a place where Christian faith is very strong.
This has caused change in many Igbo culture
Now many Igbos do not believe that bad spirit lives in any child that is born into this world with dreads.
But they still take this kind of child to the church for priests to pray for him/her.
Doctor Anthony Mgbolu told BBC Igbo that dreads are from family generation
What Igbo culture explained about people with dreads.
An expe in the study of Africa and language in the University of Lagos Chiagozie Nnabuihe explained to BBC Igbo that Igbo land in the ancient time did not have any belief about people with dreads
Nnabuihe strongly affirmed that if Igbos in the ancient time had believed in dreads, they would given it a name
In his words, 'Dada' is a Yoruba term for dreads.
That the Igbos revere dreads is because they have had contact with the Yorubas.
But are dreads really bad thing?
Nnamdi Daniels is a performer
Many people we interviewed said that there is nothing really bad in dreads, but many people still see those with dreads as people with bad character.
Nnamdi Daniels, a man with dreads, told BBC Igbo that he has seen hell from the myriads of insult to him because of his dreads.
He said 'I remember when I travelled to Niger state University
A security agent began to ask me surprising questions because of my dreads. This brought me a big shame'

The Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, said this when the committee set up by his ministry to look into the problem of codiene came to show him their findings.
He also said that this is to show that government are firm in their resolution to ban codiene medicine in Nigeria.
Banning of codiene: the price for cough medicine has increased
NAFDAC has lifted the ban on Emzor and others.
Adewole said that his ministry and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control collaborated in this wiping off
Remember that in May this year, BBC showed on television the havoc codiene cough syrup was causing in Nigeria.
It was when this was shown that the government said that they will ban the buying and drinking of this cough syrup.
The government are saying that they are still looking into other cough syrups with destructive effects.

What is evil forest?
An expert in Africa and language studies in University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, explained to BBC Igbo that Igbo called this place forest of the spirits, and not evil forest like so many people call it now.
This place was also a place they excommunicated anybody cursed by the land.
This place was also a place where they excommunicated anybody cursed by the land.

Murder is a taboo
Igbo believe that the land sees everything, this means that there is no sin you can hide away from it.

These are the sicknesses the land effects those who offended it with.
Leprosy
Swollen stomach
Drop st
Hernia
Nnabuihe explained that that time, no traditional doctor would try to cure these named sicknesses
Anybody with these sicknesses should totally confess the wrongs done before he/she dies.
If he/she did not confess the sins committed, they would excommunicate him/her In the evil forest.
Do you know the God worshipped by the Igbos in the ancient time?
The things that should not be done around an Igbo person
Other things like committing adultery with another's husband or wife, or giving birth to twins and incurable sickness may cause the land to curse that person
Excommunication is not a sin.
Like Nnabuihe explained, excommunication of that person is in older to save his children and family.
Christianity is the highest belief in the Igbo land
The Igbos in the ancient time believed that anybody that received this person has injured the wrath of land on his family.

Igbo Tradition: The reason for marrying a woman's corpse in Igbo land.
Most times people ask the reason behind marrying a woman's corpse in some areas of Igbo land, this story explained it.
A man and a woman in union
Igbo does not support cohabitation without marriage.
Most often there are news of youths who love themselves, and agreed to live together as husband and wife without fulfilling the cultural demands for marriage.
Sometimes unforseen circumstances arise in this situation, especially the woman dieing in the man's house when the cultural marriage rites were not performed.
Women's title in Igbo land
Five things that interest women
Is 'Omugwo' a tradition to abolish in Igbo land?
However, this causes confusion in different families.
Because of this bad condition, many villages in Igbo land, made it a law that a man will marry the corpse of a woman whom he was living with him without paying the complete dowry
The reason for marrying a woman's corpse.
Igbo land, a man is not married unless he paid the woman's dowry.
If even he married in court, he is expected to go to the woman's family and do things as they want.
Like an expert in culture, Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (Duruagwu the second) of Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State, told BBC Igbo, this law is very potent in their village, it goes different punishments.
He who does not marry alive, marries in death, is the system most villages adopted.
But in Akokwa village also in Imo State, this thought is not potent at all, where the woman's family come and take the corpse of their daughter home for burial.
The system for marrying a woman's corpse
The man will first come and told the family that their daughter is sick (he will not tell them that she is dead at first).
They will follow him to visit their daughter, when they have seen her, they will accuse the man of killing their daughter, and the man will start denying it.
To prove that he did not kill her he would agree to marry the woman's corpse.
He will come and marry it.
He would come back and tell the family that their daughter has died.
The man will proceed to do her burial ceremony
What will happen to who refused marrying a woman's corpse
Like Nze Ukaejuoha explained, these are what will befall who refused to marry a woman he did not pay her dowry at death
That person would receive different punishments
He will also be met with different bad things.
Things will not go well with such a person.
That person may also die a miserable death.
But such person may repent, most especially when all these things started befalling him.
What that person will do when he repents
If that man was stubborn but later repented because of the problems he was getting, these are the things he will do:
That person will send the elders of his village to pacify the land
He would be punished by doing all he should do in double folds.
Nigeria 2019 elections: characteristics of those contesting presidency -Muhammadu Buhari
The Nigeria President, Muhammadu Buhari is vying presidency the second term in democracy dispensation under the ruling party.

President Muhammadu Buhari is presently seeking vote to be Nigeria's president the third time.

When he was ruling as a soldier, Buhari was not known for respecting human right.
Despite that we are in democracy, many people are in prison because Buhari did not agree to release them as the court decided.
This man at age 76 took oath of service in 2015, and promised that he will fight corruption and insurgency, and improvement of Niger's economy.
Four years is elapsing but many people do not agree that he has made any remarkable achievements.
He promised to defeat Boko Haram in the war Nigeria fights against the sect that wants an Islamic state in Northern Nigeria, but presently, this sect torments this intention of Buhari through its invasion of this area.
Prominent individuals believe that Buhari will face strong contest with a more prominent non-ruling. The flag bearer of PDP, Atiku Abubakar is also an Islam from Northern Nigeria like Buhari.
Buhari, the flag bearer of All Progressive Congress (APC) is known to be upright among Nigerian politicians, despite that some see his campaign as waste of resources.

From what I saw with Buhari- gross incompetence, segregation, corruption, weakness of the body, mental weakness and others- compare him to Atiku.
Atiku will do double folds better than Buhari.
He also talked about Boko Haram and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)

It is also necessary to do culture and sensitivity tests before giving preventive drugs to someone.
Whoever that is sick should go to a hospital for a test for drugs to be prescribed for him/her.
Health workers should explain to people how important it is to know how to take these preventive drugs.

INEC Server: We have recorded the number of all the card readers in a computer.
INEC said that the names of those that registered for 2019 elections are in their computer.
Festus Okoye and Emeka Unachukwu
INEC messenger Festus Okoye strongly says that the commission does not have server that will give them opportunity to transmit the result of 2019 elections.
Okoye said that Nigeria constitution does not permit them to do that.
Justice Garba has taken over the case between Atiku and Buhari.
National Assembly have approved the 2019 budget.
In his speech, 'Nigeria constitution gave provision to carry all the results of elections in Form EC8A at hand to collation centres of their wards.
The Nigeria constitution we used for the elections does not know the use of computer to send any message.
It is the duty of the collation officers to carry the papers to where they are needed by hand.
There was never a time we used computer to send election results.
Okoye agreed that all who registered their names for 2019 elections are recorded in computer, that all the parties were given the names of those people.
The use of incident form will not stop manipulations going on in election.
He strongly affirmed 'It is only when computer is used for voting that one would say that something is in the server.
He said that he does not know about the result of 2019 elections being in the server.
On the same hand, BBC asked a renowned computer operator, Emeka Unachukwu what is server?
Unachukwu said 'Server is a computer that links other computers used for storing different information together.
He said that INEC can say that they don't have server because there is another office storing data for them but it is not true that they don't have server since they have data.
He said that the internet has its own server where many people keep their information.
Unachukwu said 'INEC cannot say that don't have because they have where they store data.
They may call this data base but it is server because that computer unites others together which can receive from or send message to it.'
He said it is difficult for INRC to say they don't have server.
If they are calling people to come and collect their PVCs they should be ready for elections.
Unachukwu said that even if voting was done and transmitted manually to where it was counted, INEC will still put it in the server.
But they can say they have not keyed the result of 2019 election in the server which shows that they have not finished their work.
