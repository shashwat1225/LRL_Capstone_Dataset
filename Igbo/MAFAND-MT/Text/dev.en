Many people are either craftmen or traders.
When Muhammadu Buhari was campaigning for election, one of his key promises was to give employment.
Buhari's speech in the 2015 election instigated the recent criticizm mostly as the national population commission published that seven million five hundred people have been unemployed since 2016.
NBS said this in its book titled ' Labour Force Statistics. Vol 2: Employment by Sector Report'.
This book was published in Abuja last Sunday.
What does this news mean?
BBC Igbo asked Cheta Nwaeze, who works with SB Morgen, ministry of information. Cheta told us that the things involved in giving information is complex. But he said that a lot has happene in different places of work for the past two years.
My wife was sacked when Nigeria had a dispute with MTN that it affected her work place.
This dispute has affected lots of enterprises who could no longer get contract from MTN.
I know a lot of people that worked in Proctor and Gamble but were sacked when the one-fourth of the workers were layed off.
This dispute has affected lots of people just as Cheta Nwanze has said.
Some children (not the ones in this picture), are no longer going to school because their parents are unemployed.
BBC Igbo asked Nwanze about the steps taken by the Nigerian government to create employment opportunities.
He said that ' the NBS findings show that petroleum business is no longer lucrative as it should'.
This shows that despite the inflow of money in the petroleum sector, how many people have been employed in that sector?
When there is a gahering, you will see that there is hardship.
BBC Igbo called the representatives of the Nigerian government to comment on the NBS release but non among them responded.
But the Buhari led government introduced N-Power, school feeding programme and other 'social empowerment programmes' they will use to help the Nigerian citizens.

See ten poor man's food that the rich also eat
Some food that were meant for the poor in the past is now what the rich has listed for healthy living.
In Nigeria, about thirty or fourty years ago, some food are food are seen to be for the poor.
Some of these food are what people get from their farms or buy cheap in the market because they are not on great demand.
But now, these food now interest the rich because of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problem, stroke, cancer and obessity that are known as sickness for the rich.
In the 2008 research statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO), it was found that out of one hundred and sixty-nine persons, 11.2 percentage of the population are High Blood Pressure Nigerian patients while, 2.7 percent are Nigerian diabetes patients.
The fear of these sickness made people to go back to the food that were previously overlooked which led to an increase in their prices that the poor can no longer afford.
See 10 out of those food:
Ice fish
Ice fish was previously regared as food for the poor.
For more than thirty years ago, ice fish is usually seen when the poor cook in their homes, students or when there is no money available. but beef or chicken was for the rich.
Kingsley Udofa a person who lives in Lagos explained how ice fish was disregarded, he said 'there was a time in Nigeria when ice fish was only for the poor.
Then, ice fish was called different names to humiliate it such as 'fish corpse by the Igbos, Lagos corpse by the Yorubas, walking corpse by the Ibibios.
People stopped eating and buying ice fish.
Now everything has changed
Ice fish is now scarce and on high demand by a lot of people including the rich that it is now costly in the market.

Just as the minister of Agriculture Sen Heineken Lokpobiri said, Nigerians consume about 3.2 million metric tone of fish yearly that seventy percent from it are imported.
ten thousand metre and metric ton is produces three hundred and thirty- four thousand containers.
cocoyam
cocoyam is becoming expensive
Uri cocoyam or Koko cocoyam or bread, cocoyam is food for the wretched, food for the poor because they cannot afford yam.
But now, cocoyam is common because everbody eats it.
Aside the towns that cocoyam pounds is one of their famous meals, those who are diabetic, hypertensive, weight lossers has made cocoyam unreachable to the poor, that buying cocoyam for cooking is as though one is buying contraband.
3. Cow skin
Cow skin populary called 'kpọmọ' by the yorubas, was eaten by the poor when there was no money for beef or chicken.
As it is now, the rich has taken it to be a healthy food, it is used to cook vegetable soup or mix it with pepper and drink with it.
In 2014, when the government spoke through the former minister of Agriculture Akinwumi Adesina that they want to ban people from eating cow skin. This was not accepted by the people which made the government to refrain from the idea.
Just as scientists said, cow skin does not have fats or cholesterol just as beef, which they said that too much consumption of it causes a terminal illness like hypertension.
Plantain
Some people call it ogede, some abịrịka, others plantain, while many call it une or unere.
The poor eat the roasted one with red oil, and also use it to cook beans but now, the rich has made plantain a food on high demand.
Plantain is a good food that replenishes the body because it has fibre and other minerals that are good for the health such as magnesium, phosphorous na potassium.
Just as health scientists have said, plantain gives blood when cooked unripped.
Snail
Snail is a good food that is nutritious but it is expensive now
If there is no meat or fish, the poor goes into the forest in search of snail.
The rich had no time for snail just as the Igbo says that there is suffering in its preparation.
But now, cooking with snail is a sign that one is rich because of the high price of snail in the market
Snail is a good food that gives protein, calcium, selenium, magnesium and gives blood.
Garri.
Garri is food for both the poor and the rich
In the past, eating garri especially when it is drank is regarded as food for the poor or food eaten when one is broke.
If you ask students who live in school, they will tell you how drinking garri with groundnut, fried fish or roasted meat has saved their lives
Now garri is a contraband
Now the rich and the poor struggle for garri that a painter costs more than five hundred naira.
A cancer specialist in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr Remi Ajekigbe said that many Nigerians are suffering from cancer because they no longer eat our local foods like garri, yam that has fibre rather they eat foreign foods.
Beans
Beans is a good food for the health
Beans is another peculiar food for the poor but the rich now eat it.
beans gives protein and also blood
Food nutritionists are saying that beans is a better protein source than meat because it does not contain cholesterol
Breadfruit
Breadfruit is a special food prepared by a hardworking person
Breadfruit was usually over looked by the rich probably because of the tedious task of its preparation but now only those who can afford it can eat it.
Breadfruit gives protein, blood, potassium and other healthy nutrients.
Water yam.
Water yam has fibre
Water yam is not usually eaten by people probably because it is not tasty.
only the poor used it to satisfy their hunger
But now lots of people including the rich eat it.
diabetes patients still take sugar
Scientists explains that water yam contains lots of fibre, small 'sodium' and a lot of 'potassium' that it is said to be good for diabetic patients.
Remember that 'fibre' helps in digestion, too much 'sodium' causes hypertension, while 'potassium' regulates the blood, and prevents one from having kidney stone.
crayfish
crayfish is now expensive that some poor people can no longer afford it
The poor usually cooked with crayfish when they could not afford fish or meat. But now, periwinkle is now for the rich because of its cost in the market.
Why people now prefer food meant for the poor
Just as a doctor of food and nutrition Dr Florence Uchendu explained why a lot of people now eat food that were avoided is because of the illness that are in Nigeria now such as diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer.
The illness in Nigeria now are foreign illnesses we did not suffer from before now.
Such illnesses as diabetes and hypertension are very common now.
People now know the food that are not good for the health.

functions of Igbo groups
Title holders- the council of title holders is the highest group in the community, they are the last resort to every case.
They have the final say in the community
They are the holders of the tradition and 'ọfọ' of the community to ensure justice and also see that everyone is just.
Before one is accepted into this group, the person must be an extremely wise person who has show cased it
That is why men who went to fight in wars in the past, come back sometimes with human skulls.
They are accorded great respect in Igbo land while members of the title holders wear eagle on their cap to show that they are reverenced in the community because Eagle is the most beautiful bird in Igbo land.
The white clothes they wear signifies purity of hear and character and also in justice.
Their red cap signifies that the progress of the community lies in their sacrifice of blood and pain.
They are divided into two: elders and chiefs.
The elders are higher in rank than the chiefs.
Kinsmen - These are the first born sons from every family in the community.
They are the decision makers of the different decisions made for the progress of the community.
All defaulters are reported to the kinsmen, they go to the deities to find out about the things concerning the community or their families.
Every house hold has kinsmen to whom they take cases concerning land dispute, sharing boundaries, inheriting wives and crime against the land such as murder, theft, fornication or adultery.
Any decision they take stands in the whole community
The kindsmen are seen as representatives of different families
First daughters- this is the female group in the community, this is where women unite to discuss about their house holds, husbands and children

They function as the police and see that there is order in the community
Any time there is dispute like land dispute, masquerade goes to the land and plants palm frond to signify that nobody will be permitted to use the land until a decision is made concerning it.
Masquereds also come out to make the people happy by dancing
Similarities of the old and new leadership
Council of title holders is the last resort for any dispute that could not be settled by the kinsmen or the group of first born daughters.
They have the final say in every decision
Kinsmen and first born daughters are like the community representatives.
The kinsmen make laws concerning the community. It is meant for all first born sons of every family in the community.
The age grade are like the soldiers of the community that secures the community and sees that there is peace in the entire community.
they go or organize anything in the community that is not the way it should be
The masquered is like the police that fishes out culprits in the community.
This was how the Igbos functioned before the whites introduced the 'Warrant Chiefs' system.
these groups worked and ensured the progress of the Igbos without anyone being the king but as it is now, kings are being corronated for political reasons.
The question being asked now is, is the new system better than the old system of governance?
