Here are 10 poor foods that the rich are now eating.
Some of the foods formerly known as the poor are now eaten by the rich because of health issues.
In Nigeria, about 30 or 40 years ago, some of these foods were meant for the poor.
Most of these foods are foods people either get from their farms or buy cheaply in the market because demands are not much.
Nowadays, these foods are being consumed by the rich because of the high rate of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and obesity.
In 2008, the World Health Organization investigated on a study which shows that out of 11.2 percent of Nigerians, 169 million had hypertension while 2.7 percent had diabetes.
The panic is the reason why so many people are returning to the once-despised diet. Nowadays, these foods are so expensive that the poor cannot afford them.
Here are 10 of the foods:
Iced fish
Iced fish was once seen as a poor food
More than thirty years ago, iced fish were used to cook in poor homes, schools or when there was no money, while beef or chicken were for the rich.
Lagos resident Kingsley Udofa described how iced fish was not recognized as a good food: 'There was a time in Nigeria when iced fish was meant for the poor.'
At that time, iced fish were labeled with bad names such as 'Dead Fish'. People stopped buying and eating it.
Now, things have changed. Iced fish are too costly in the market because many people including the rich buy it.

Igbo Taboos: five things that Igbo land forbids
Five things that can cause death in the olden days in Igbo land, for the land forbids it
This family killed
Till now, murder is an abomination in the entire Igbo land
In the olden days, the Igbos have many behaviours which attract death immediately someone commits them
Chiagozie Nnabuihe who is a professor of African studies in the University of Lagos, explained that it is the spirit underworld that forbids these abomination
who is the spirit of the land?
Tradition explained that the spirit of the land is a woman
do you know the god worshipped by the Igbos in the olden days?
can you do the kind of sacrifices of appeal done in the olden days
Aside Most-high God, land is the most important spirit in Igbo land
In the olden days, Igbo believes that land can trouble anyone that defiles it
it is this spirit that ensure the germination of seed in the farm, and also continous wetness of the ground
What are the five things the Igbos and Spirit of the land forbid?
murder
Anyone that commits murder will bear the consequences
The land forbids human blood
Nnabuihe explained that the Igbos believed that land is a life giver
That is why it becomes law that nobody kills another, for the person will not be able to give life
The punishment for anybody who commits murder is to banish the person from the land or send the person to the evil forest where he/she will die
to commit suicide
The land will reject who kills himself
Like murder, suicide is also what the land forbids because blood is involved
Nnabuihe explained that the land rejects the corpse of anyone that commits suicide
Before they take the person's corpse to the evil forest, the native doctors will offer many sacrifices to wipe out any disaster which it could bring to the people
it is after this ceremony that the youths will carry the person's corpse to the evil forest
sleeping with a member of your family
this is what the land forbids and also an abomination in Igbo land
If a child is born through this act, the villagers will carry him to the evil forest and banish the family of the child from the land
Igbo believes that land has cursed that family
sleeping with animals
This animal contacts disease
It is difficult to hear that someone commits such a thing in Igbo land
But whenever it happens, Igbo believes that the land will transmit disease to the person
This disease could be madness, leprosy, stomach upset or dropsy and other things
The people will hurriedly take the person to the evil forest where he will die
giving birth to twins
Christianity has made Igbos stopped many of these laws
This is heartbreaking but the cause is not known
Igbo believes in the olden days that the land is a life giving spirit, also gives child, gives a couple only one baby at a time
The believe that any woman who give birth to twins, has a sexual affair with another man who is not her husband
What happens when a woman gives birth to twins is that both the woman and the children will be taken to the evil forest where they will die

Drug abuse: taking preventive drugs unnecessarily reduces its effectiveness
A medical doctor has stated why preventive drugs are not effective anymore
Drugs
WHO has stated that many 'antibiotics' are no more effective as supposed now
In the discussion between the Igbo BBC and a medical personnel Doctor Orhiakhi, he stated many things why the drugs are not effective anymore
Government has banned codeine
Codeine: NAFDAC has shutdown 3 pharmaceutical industry
See the things he said
These bacteria will persist that the drug will not be effective
If the patient does not take the drug as dued, through overdose or over taking the prescribed days
Some take these preventive drugs when not supposed which could affect the effectiveness of the drug in the future
Not taken up to the right prescribed doses can cause the uneffectiveness of the drugs
These cause the drugs to be familiar with the bacteria, thereby causing the uneffectiveness of the drugs
But who really are they? Simply, technology.
Kano is centre of commerce, but if Kano does not become centre of e-commerce, it will disappear because technology is the future.
Everything is electronic now, even in Nigeria right now, any company that is not leveraging on technology will die.
If Shoprite does not evolve to online sales, Jumia will kill them and that's the truth.
So, that's the future, there is nothing you can do about it.
How does your New Partner Programme works?.
It is very simple, normally if I refer you to a broker, there is what we call spread, which is the difference between buying and selling price.
That is where brokers make their money.
They share about 50 per cent of that trading initially and we call them partners.
What if I refer you and you now become a partner and you refer somebody else and that person becomes a partner, who also referred someone?
Shouldn't you be making money in referring somebody?
That is the new system that we have created, like higher level of stream of income for a partner, making it a multi-layer, instead of just a single layer system.
How reliable is the technology behind this business plan?.
Technology is not new.
At least, I have been in the business between seven and eight years and it has been around that same time.
I don't think there has ever been any day that the whole market is down and nothing is working.
That has never happened.
For example, about 60 per cent of the whole American economy is in New York Stock Exchange, which is why companies like Ali Baba in China can leave the country to raise money in America because there's no other place you can get that kind of money.
The whole American economy is built on the New York Stock Exchange, which is the same trading we are talking about.
If it is not reliable, they won't put all their lives in it.
When people tell me that the likes of 'Wonder Banks' and MMM had gone under, wondering if the forex market will not go like them, I only tell them that they are looking at it locally.
Forex market is not a Nigerian thing, it's not an American thing, it is not a Japanese thing, it is the whole world and driven by a level of fundamentals.
So, it can go down unless human beings are all going down.
What competitive advantage is Rally Trade coming with?.
To be frank, all brokers offer the same thing.
It's like all Nigerian stockbrokers offer the same thing.
You want to buy First Bank or GTBank shares, they are all offering the same thing.
But the things that can make you different are in-depth customer service, things that sometimes, as a stockbroker, you take more time to research on.
Of course, you can advise your clients on how to buy shares.
But if people can see that your clients are making more money, it becomes extra advantage.
In Rally Trade for instance, we have unusual customer support.
Our staff call clients every day to know if there is any problem or challenge.
Every client has a dedicated staff that takes care of his or her business.
Then we have the best education system here.
There is no company that is educating Nigerians like Rally academy does.
In terms of our conferences, expos, seminars and the trainings we do in our office frequently.
So, those are some of the two major advantages that we have- essential customer service and quality education system.
There is this fear about Fintech, especially that of trust.
What is your take?.
All a company can do is to make sure that it is dealing with a regulated institution, the same way we are sure that banks are regulated by Central Bank of Nigeria.
We are regulated in Europe by financial commission.
At the same time, when I talk to people about online business, if you decide to run away and hide yourself in the sand, saying you don't trust it, your money might disappear, you will never do anything.
You won't believe that some people don't use ATM till today, you know why, saying if they are being caught up in a corner, all their money will be collected.
Some people don't use Internet banking but that doesn't help you at all.
You are losing more than you are gaining.
That is the way it is.
With the current technology comes challenges and hacking of funds, but yet, there is nothing you can do about it other than find how to use them safely and make sure you do enough research.
Wherever you are putting your money, do extensive research.
For instance, in the last 10 years, Nigerians have gone through several scams.
We had MMM, Wonder Banks, among others, but I have never lost one kobo to any of them because I learnt about 10 years ago that there are no free money and I had been a victim online, when I lost like $200 and had to withdraw.
So, when Wonder Bank and MMM came, I knew that it was just scam.
People need to be educated, do research, then you really have very little issues when it comes to doing financial business online.
What is the MT4 Platform all about?.
Let me try to describe the MT4 in a simple way.
Let's use car, which is the best way.
A Toyota and a Honda, what is the difference? Nothing! They both are cars.
But in Nigeria, we have more Toyota than Honda, why? People just love Toyota! Or maybe Toyota is easier to maintain or it has more second hand value or it is cheaper to buy.
The same way we have different trading platforms.
For instance, there is a company called Tesla, which makes car in the U.S.
He added that immense opportunities abound in the sector that had remained largely untapped. 'This is why most advanced economies of the world have highly developed their maritime industries'.
They didn't exist before now.
The same way companies create trading platforms for themselves.
So, I can start a brokerage company and decide that like the software banks use, I don't want to use a certain platform, but a fresh one people can trade on that can be better, but that doesn't mean people are going to love it.
Tesla is in America now but doesn't mean it is selling more than Toyota that has been selling for a while.
MT4 is just a platform people trade on, just to buy and sell, that is what it is but it is the oldest, it has the highest adoption, it is what people love the most, so every broker has it.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
It does not bother me at all that you woke up today and you are bothered by matters bothering your brethren, male and female.
It does not bother me at all that you are there seated or standing running after the necessities of life.
It bothers me a trifle that you are buffeted by the vicissitudes of life, by the vagaries and uncertainties of living and by the pursuit of that which would not last.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
Yes.
It is the will of the Almighty in creation that all subjects born of the womb shall toil and labour in order to enjoy and suffer.
The worshipper of the Merciful shall observe vigil at night in order to qualify for His favours.
The armed robber shall forsake the pleasure of his bed at night in order to visit pain on the neighbourhood and thereby qualify for punishment and eternal damnation.
Those who shall enter paradise have to work and sweat; those who shall enter hell would have to earn it through toil and labour! I am not bothered by all of these simply because this is the reality.
I am concerned with one other thing, however.
I am concerned with the possibility that you are involved in the frenetic pursuit of this world on the assumption that you could indeed have it all.
No! You cannot have it all.
Nobody has ever had it all.
Nobody will ever have it all.
Evidence in support of these claims and assertions are there in your wakeful moments, in your everyday life.
There she is seated.
The pepper grinder in the neighbourhood.
Every time her husband copulates with her, pregnancy sets in.
Today, she is nursing two beautiful girls.
Only a year before, she gave birth to a boy.
Her husband is the Chief Messenger in that office.
Yes.
The Chief Messenger.
To every profession its chief.
There is the Chief Whip in the Parliament.
There are chiefs in the palace.
I wonder whether there are chiefs among thieves and kidnappers.
Yes.
There are Chief Lecturers.
But there are no Chief Professors.
Now the chief messenger of interest to me today is he whose spermatozoic prowess is reminiscent of the 'Danfo' driver in the other part of the town.
The latter is loved and abhorred by women in the bus station by equal measure.
They know that whenever he 'touches' the opposite sex, often times illicitly, the latter would bear the 'burden' for the next nine months.
This Chief Danfo driver owns no vehicle.
He owns no properties.
He has no investment in any blue-chip companies.
He has no bank accounts.
He knows that he is poor.
He desires to be rich.
But at least for now, he is contented in the knowledge that he does not have it all.
He is contented that at least he has his virility and masculinity.
He is happy in the knowledge that he is an active partaker in the unceasing task of populating the world!.
Across the town, in an area known as GRA, there lives the multi-millionaire.
He has almost everything money can buy- a posh house and state-of-the-art automobiles.
His wife is that woman who is subject of the second gaze whenever she steps out of her home: beautiful, elegant and intelligent.
However, despite these provisions and blessings, the woman is not happy.
She cries every night because she has not been blessed with the fruit of the womb.
Whenever she contemplates the plum and pleasure that surrounds her, she remembers what material comfort cannot provide.
She shed hot tears for being barren.
She has it; but she cannot have it all.
Meanwhile, one of the children of the poor 'Danfo' driver is registered in one of the public schools in the neighbourhood.
As fate would have it, he is a classmate to one of the children of the 'big men' in town.
While the child of the poor driver comes to school barefooted and in completely worn out school uniform, his classmate is brought to school every morning by a chauffeur-driven car.
The boy's food basket is usually the most sought after one during the break time.
The irony however is this- each time the school closes for the session, the son of the poor driver always takes the first position while his classmate, the child of the rich man, takes the last position.
The rich man has it; but he cannot, by His design, have it all.
Have you ever found yourself in situations where people demand favours from you, favours you cannot grant unto yourself?
What about the Vice-Chancellor of that university whose children have continually failed the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) organized by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
He presides over life-long opportunities; opportunities none of his children can by law enjoy.
He has this; he does not have that because he cannot have it all!.

'We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,' Moghalu said.
He said that measures were installed to address challenges by ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness in the industry, as well as the privatisation of the port.
There's a lot of talk about toilets lately.
After the Obama administration told US schools to let transgender pupils use toilets matching their gender identity, everyone has an opinion about who should use which toilet.
Meanwhile in the interest of public service, I'd also like to encourage a debate about 'how' toilets are used.
I encourage male readers to pay particular attention because I'm asking you to stop peeing on rather than in the toilet.
Were an alien species to conduct an in-depth study of the human species, they would say of Nigerian men ‚Äì a well-adapted group, intellectually vigorous, entrepreneurial and charming, but with disgraceful toilet manners.
Of course there would be exceptions and some women would be similarly judged.
But the good number of male 'splashers' amidst us would bring the score down.
Since aliens may not land on earth in my lifetime, I conducted my own in-depth study about this corrosive issue.
The study did not (thankfully) involve visits to the Gents.
Rather it was undertaken (reluctantly) in the one given place where all genders share toilets, namely on airplanes.
The study confirmed that using the shared toilets on flights to and from Nigeria is an extraordinarily unpleasant experience.
In fact, the situation is such that on my next Nigeria bound flight I will bring a raincoat, rubber gloves and Wellies.
Jokes aside, toilet use is in truth a political issue.
Fela Anikulapo-Kuti himself often connected the scatological with the political.
Though judging by the lines, 'Long time ago African man no dey carry shit, we dey shit inside big big hole, na European man teach us to carry shit', Fela may have disagreed with me on toilet matters.
Because in a sense, I am indeed advocating for western toilet habits.
(By the way, I never imagined I would combine those last three words.).
Moghalu, then, said that developing a policy framework to include strategic objectives, policy action and strategic plan for implementation to precede reforming the transport sector.
To be clear, had we modernized the old African way of using the toilet to contemporary society it would be better suited both for the environment and for our bodies.
But I'm thankful that at least airplanes don't use the hole system, or I would need to add a diving suit to my in-flight gear.
Toilet use is not only a political matter, but also a 'geopolitical' one.
I hate to admit it, but I find myself making toilet habit comparisons between countries.
It turns out that flights to and from the US are a particularly 'dry' experience.
When you enter a toilet cubicle that has just been used by an American man, nine out of ten times it will be pristine.
Maybe American men go to a special toilet training school? Or maybe they are just particularly good at tactical target aiming.
[Sarcasm].
Whatever the case may be, I see no reason why my countrymen can't show equal consideration to their fellow human beings.
Tottenham Hotspur's South Korean striker Son Heung-Min (L) and Tottenham Hotspur's Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld (R) celebrate on the pitch after the English Premier League football match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at the Molineux stadium in Wolverhampton, central England on December 15, 2019.
Tottenham won the game 2-1. Paul ELLIS / AFP.
'It is on this basis that we have decided to engage the civil society and all other stakeholders in the maritime subsector in the South East Geopolitical Zone.
Jan Vertonghen's stoppage time header continued Tottenham's turnaround under Jose Mourinho as Spurs moved up to fifth with a 2-1 win at Wolves.
Mourinho's men were largely outplayed at Molineux, but were ruthless with their chances to inflict Wolves' first league defeat in 12 games.
Adama Traore's spectacular strike had cancelled out Lucas Moura's early opener before Vertonghen stooped to guide home Christan Eriksen's corner.
Spurs can now move into the top four before Christmas if they beat Chelsea at home next weekend.
That speaks volumes for the impact Mourinho has made in less than a month in charge as Tottenham trailed Chelsea and the top four by 12 points when he was appointed.
Wolves drop to eighth as their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since 1962 came to an end, but there was little more Nuno Espirito Santo's men could have done to at least avoid defeat.
After an industrious start by Wolves, it was Spurs who scored after eight minutes.
Son Heung-min's drive was beaten away by Rui Patricio but the ball was worked to Moura, who glided into the area before rifling in high from an angle for his third goal in seven games under Mourinho.
Wolves remained undaunted though and after Paulo Gazzaniga gathered Traore's low effort they began to create openings.
Diogo Jota was a menace and it was from his work Raul Jimenez nearly levelled after 26 minutes but his low effort flashed wide.
Soon after Jota was denied by the recovering Davinson Sanchez after the defender's initial mistake allowed the forward through.
Wolves continued to dominate but should have been 2-0 down nine minutes before the break.
Referee Stuart Attwell played a good advantage after Moura was fouled to allow Eric Dier forward.
He played a cute one-two with Dele Alli to leave the midfielder with just Patricio to beat but his low strike hit the post.
It would have been harsh on Wolves and they continued to push after the break.
Jota failed to turn in Traore's cross and Gazzaniga pushed away Jimenez's shot.
Spurs' defence had lived dangerously, with Vertonghen in particular struggling against the pace of Traore.
Wolves finally got their reward on 67 minutes.
Traore had given the visitors problems all game and he made them pay, collecting Jimenez's pass and unleashing a rocket which flew past Gazzaniga from 20 yards.
Tottenham then never looked like restoring their lead before the late drama.
Wolves remained the aggressors and Romain Saiss' glancing header four minutes later forced Gazzaniga into a fine stop.
But Spurs silenced the hosts in the first minute of injury time when Vertonghen nodded in Eriksen's corner.
Manish Rohtagi is the Business Head for Simba Group of Companies.
Simba Group has reiterated its commitment to empowering more Nigerians through its products and services.
Business Head of Simba TVS, Mr Manish Rohtagi, speaks on partnership with some Microfinance Banks, while banks should lend more to customers, the business environment, economy and challenges faced by businesses operating in the country.
What is Simba Group all about?.
Simba Group has been in this country for over 30 years.
We started our business with bicycles and bicycle parts way back in 1988.
We are present in several key sectors that are critical to the development of the Nigerian economy including transport, power, IT, agriculture etc.
The office you are in is the headquarters of our transport business.
We in partnership with TVS Motors India are the largest manufacturers of kekes (tricycles) in Nigeria and our two wheelers, also known colloquially as okadas, continue to reshape the Nigerian two-wheeler market.
How does the TVS brand help the Nigerian Economy?.
Transport is essential to the functioning of any economy and is one of the main drivers of it.
Our products address the last mile transport needs of Nigerians.
It has been shown each tricycle or motorcycle sold creates employment for around four people as these machines not only require riders, but also mechanics, dealers and spares distributors etc.
That's even without considering our own employees.
Hence this industry is one of the biggest employment generators in the country.
Along with that we have been running several programmes that empower the youth of the country.
We have worked with several government agencies including National Automotive Design Development Council (NADDAC), National Directorate of Employment (NDE) among others and trained countless people into becoming keke riders or mechanics for free.
We also try to partner with the State and Federal Governments so that we empower more and more youths.
Could you tell us a bit about Simba Group's other companies?.
As I mentioned earlier, along with transportation, Simba Group is into power backup.
Our Luminous Inverters are the most popular inverter brand in the country, we are also heavily investing in the development of solar energy.
Other companies in the group include Simba Agric where we focus on mechanisation which includes tractors and irrigation systems ‚Äì both responsible for increasing agricultural productivity.
Simba Cycles sells bicycles, SimbaNET provides business connectivity solutions to corporates and Simba Infrastructure offers Business Communication Solutions in partnership with Avaya.
But basically, the focus area for me is transportation.
What have been the challenges so far?.
We get lots of support from government institutions but there is still a huge opportunity for public and private sector financial institutions to increase the access to cheap and collateral-free borrowing, in order to provide a major boost to the industry, and the economy at large.
How many financial institutions have helped?.
There has been much progress, and impetus from the Central Bank as well.
But there's still a long way to go before we really begin to see efficient financial models coming into play.
There are few microfinance banks who have partnered with us and things are getting better.
If many more banks can come and offer people loans to buys kekes and okadas at a subsidised rate or even collateral free, then things will move much faster.
What are your projections for the nearest future?.
We see limitless growth potential in the country and the growth quantum can be much bigger than any other countries.
Nigeria can be among the top 10 economies in the world.
I truly believe that, and our investments in the economy certainly reflect that.
Is your organisation into any Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities?.
CSR has always been integral to the Simba Group.
As part of our group philosophy of empowerment, even our CSR programmes follow the same ideology.
At the heart of our offering is our emphasis on training- something that we provide free of charge to mechanics and engineers who aspire to be mini-entrepreneurs or gainfully employed in the industries we represent.
We have intervened in times of national disaster, such as our actions and contributions during the recent Kano floods, and have been praised for our contributions to the victims of that terrible atrocity.
We believe in wome empowerment very strongly, and our efforts to support the development of women, have taken two forms.
Firstly, we have partnered with the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD) to distribute cycles to girl students to encourage them to attend school.
And secondly, we run the Queen Riders programme ‚Äì a programme in which we train and certify women from under-privileged backgrounds to become Keke riders and help them on the path to self-employment by harnessing the ecosystem of financiers that we have created.
Celebrating its 125 years of research and impacts, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, has acknowledged the positive impacts of a homegrown technological device developed in Nigeria on value chain development of the root and tuber crops in Africa.
The institute admits that smallholder farmers have benefited and would continue to improve their means of livelihood with the use of value-adding devices in the post-harvest management of their roots and tubers.
The device, called flash dryer, dries agricultural products such as yam, cassava, potato and other granulated food commodities for elongated shelf life, higher profitability and food security.
The project that propped up the improvement of the design by Nobex Technologies was an initiative of Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), facilitated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and executed through multiple partnership.
One of the ways CAVA2 supports smallholders is by offering farmers more 'avenues for sales' for their cassava roots.
To ensure a smooth flow of roots from farm to product, CAVA2 works with SMEs to expand and develop processing capacity; a key issue is the availability of quality equipment and after sales service.
The Nigerian who developed the device in working with the institute, Mr Idowu Adeoya, fabricates equipment for drying and roasting root and tuber crops.
The improvement to the flash dryer, which dries agricultural products almost instantaneously, was started in 2006 when the fabricator was first contacted by specialists from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), led by the Country Manager of CAVA Nigeria, Professor Lateef Sanni, and a food processing specialist from NRI, Dr Andrew Graffham, from the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, the United Kingdom.
As part of a FUNAAB-NRI collaboration, they had encountered a Nobex flash dryer at a factory in Akure, 300km from Lagos.
The team was interested in collecting some data about the dryer, in order to look into its efficiency.
Mr Adeoya welcomed Dr Graffham's interest and some months later, he was visited by NRI agricultural engineering specialist, Dr Andrew Marchant.
Improvements included reduced fuel usage from 374 to 65 litres per tonne of dried product; increased output from approximately 100kg an hour to around 330kg an hour of dried product; and increased efficiency, from 11 to 55 percent.
Building on CAVA2's experience and progress with the fabricator in Nigeria, a complementary initiative is taking shape in Ghana, with the development of a new, fuel-efficient flash dryer on a smaller scale.
The University of Lagos, UNILAG Muslim Community, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the merit award conferred on dedicated Nigerians who have proved to be exceptional in public service.
Chairman, UNILAG Muslim Community, Prof.
Lai Olurode, in a commendation letter made available to The Guardian, applauded the recognition of the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service, Hameed Ali and that of Registrar, Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof.
Ishaq Oloyede as deserving of productivity merit award.
Olurode said: 'The two institutions are truly exceptional and had really shown that we need not be consistently skeptical about our own goodness.
'Perhaps, there are thousands outside of these two individuals who can perform far better.
The lesson in these exceptional case studies is for other public office holders to take note of factors that had assisted the rise of these organizations to pockets of effectiveness,' he stated.
Olurode however enjoined government to ensure that other moribund institutions rise to performance.
'At the UNILAG Muslim Community, we congratulate them for their being specially recognised by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
We urge them to keep up the good job and begin to mentor others for institutional effectiveness so that their exit would not usher a reversal of successes that had been attained.
Individuals cannot travel far but institutions can,' he said.
He said that measures were installed to address challenges by ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness in the industry, as well as the privatisation of the port.
Although it has been temporarily suspended by the Federal Government, there are, however, several underlining factors that still surround the operations of the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD).
'We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,' Moghalu said.
Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chairman , Partners for Electoral Reforms (PEF) says the jailing of former Gov. Orji Kalu of Abia was a proof that joining the ruling party with criminal case was not a guarantee against justice.
Nwagwu in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja said that the jailing has faulted the notion that once people with criminal record join the ruling party they were covered.
NAN reports that Kalu was on Thursday convicted of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Federal High Court in Lagos after he was found guilty of N7.2 billion fraud and money laundering.
'The judgment is a good boost for the anti-corruption fight, especially against the background of all the noise about once somebody is in the All Progressives Congress (APC) the person cannot be brought to justice.

'It is a good signal that even if you join the ruling party you will not clog the will of justice.
'It also signals the fact that no matter how long it last, once there is the determination by the court to bring justice, justice would be done.
'We are excited about the judgment and we hope that it is also brought to bear on the Babachir Lawal's case and other cases of people with a criminal record who think that being in the ruling party is a guarantee against justice,' he said
Lassa fever kills two, infects 10 in five states
Lassa fever has claimed two more lives in Abia and Edo states as the country approaches the peak season for outbreaks of the deadly disease.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June.
Latest figures from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), confirmed 10 new cases of the disease in five states: five in Ondo, two in Edo, one each in Ebonyi, Bauchi and Abia. In those new cases, one person each died in Edo and Abia states.
Man, 26, drowns at National Stadium, Surulere

Nasarawa Assembly to enact law to protect women, children against violence
The Nasarawa State House of Assembly says it will enact a law that will protect women and children against violence in the interest of development of the state and the country.
Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, the Speaker of the House, stated this on Tuesday when the state women led by the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Hajiya Halima Jabiru, led the campaign rally on violence against women to the House.
He said that the law if enacted would protect, respect and promote the rights of women and children in order to improve their health and their standard of living.

'We will enact any relevant law that will put to end violence against women and children in the state.
'We believe that the law if enacted will also protect the rights of women and children for the overall development of the state,' he said.
Abdullahi called on all Nigerians to protect women and children from all forms of violence for development to thrive in the state and the country.
'Every Nigerian should ensure that women and children are protected and are not put under unnecessary violence,' he said.
Earlier, Hajiya Halima Jabiru, the state Commissioner for Women Affairs, said that they were in the assembly to seek for the legislature's support on crusade on violence against women.
'As you can see that our women carried different placards with inscriptions such as say no to rape , no to violence against women.
NASS inauguration: Dozie Nwankwo unifies citizens as he returns
Anambra state citizens, especially those of the Njikoka, Dunukofia and Anaocha councils have been reassured of abundant democracy dividends by Chief Dozie Nwankwo, who took oath of office last Thursday as he was formally inaugurated by the leadership of the Federal House of Representatives, Abuja.
Nwankwo was sworn in after successfully reclaiming his mandate at the Court of Appeal Elections Petitions tribunal, Enugu Division on Nov 1,2019.
The inauguration which was witnessed by all and sundry, including the Minister of Transportation, Chibike Amechi, Anambra deputy Governor Nkem Okeke, Senators Victor Umeh and Rochas Okorocha, Obiora Okonkwo, national and state assemblies members, ended with a dinner.
Nigeria may miss SDG on healthcare, says Soludo
Former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has said that if the Federal Government does not initiate good reforms, the country may miss out on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthcare.
Soludo spoke at the 26th Annual Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Development Forum themed 'The Nigerian Healthcare Situation: The Way Forward' in Abuja.
According to him, tackling healthcare challenges in the country requires decisive and comprehensive war on poverty, inequality, illiteracy or poor public health education, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as provision of adequate and accessible public health facilities and insurance schemes.
'The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.'There are about 13 specific targets to meet.
From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,' he said.
Government's expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the 'other hand' (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the 'progressive decline' of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
He noted that the country's healthcare statistics was as scary as its poverty and unemployment statistics, using the average life expectancy as summary indicator.
The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.
In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr. Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.
In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country's health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.

Residents flee town of Kanu's lawyer after policemen's death
A siege allegedly laid to Oraifite in Ekwusigo Local Government of Anambra State by a combined team of soldiers and policemen forced residents to flee the community yesterday.
The desertion of the community came on the heels of declaration of Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the Supreme Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, wanted by the state police command over an alleged killing of Oliver Innoma Abbey, the Oraifite Area Commander and the SARS Commander, Ichi Sector, Patrick Agbazue.
The two officers led a police patrol team to the compound of Ejiofor in Oraifite, where the police allegedly shot at three persons and wounded scores of others suspected to belong to IPOB.
It was learnt that the seeming police invasion of the house of the counsel to Kanu, who had three days earlier buried one of his elder brothers, irked some youths in the area who allegedly launched a reprisal attack, which is believed to have resulted in the death of Abbey and Agbazue whose remains were burnt and buried near a village market.
The police and IPOB have given differing accounts of the incident in which not less than 20 houses and shops have been razed.
Revving critical national issues as Madueke launches autography
Admiral Allison MaduekeNo doubt, the story of the 30-month Nigerian Civil War of 1967 would remain a critical point for discussion anytime Nigeria is being examined in history to project for a better future.
So also the agitation for restructuring and June 12, 1993, presidential election, acclaimed to have been won by the late business mogul, Chief M.K.O Abiola but annulled by the then military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.
These issues seem recurring and cannot be overlooked as they impact on national discourse.
Twenty-one years since Nigeria returned to civil rule, those factors that led to the civil war, the unending agitations for restructuring and the perceived domination of governance system by a particular section of the country are still visible markers that still haunt the country and continue to stifle its development.
As a matter of fact, most of the issues have not been adequately tackled many leas put in proper perspectives in a manner that could have helped in reshaping the nation's growth and development.
These factors were part of issues that were publicly deliberated upon, when former Chief of Naval Staff and one-time Military Administrator of Anambra and the Imo State, Admiral Allison Madueke (rtd), launched his autobiography last week.
It is entitled Riding the Storms, with God in My Sails at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos.
Seeking inclusiveness through regional development commissions
Oduah
The quest for the establishment of development commissions for the remaining geo-political zones in the country apart from the South-south and Northeast gained momentum recently with the introduction of three bills to that effect in the Senate.
Onyedika Agbedo looks at the genesis of the move, the gimmicks around it and its likely outcome in this report.
There is a cool 'war' in the Senate among the geo-political zones in the country following penultimate Wednesday's reintroduction of a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission.
The 8th Senate had passed the bill, sponsored by Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North) on December 12, 2018, but it did not get President Muhammadu Buhari's assent.
Should the bill secure the nod of the lawmakers again and possibly receive presidential assent this time around, it would give birth to a commission charged with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds specially allocated by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reparation for lost houses and businesses of victims of the Nigerian civil war.
The commission would also address any other environmental or developmental challenges confronting the zone.
Clause 15 (2a) of the bill, which identifies source of funding for the commission, stipulates that the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total monthly statutory allocation due to the member states of the commission shall be from the Federation Account.
It also seeks the establishment of a governing board for the commission, which shall include one person each from the other five geopolitical zones of the country.
South-East NYSC coordinator inaugurates entrepreneurship centre in Aba
Alhaji Ahmed Ikaka, the South East Zonal Coordinator, National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), on Tuesday inaugurated a new Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SAED) Centre built by corps members serving in Osisioma, near Aba.
Speaking at the event, Ikaka lauded the efforts of the corps members, saying that NYSC was leading the economic revolution in Nigeria with the skill acquisition training given to corps members.
He assured Nigerians of better economy with the series of training given to corps members to make them self-reliant.
He said that Nigeria had no reason to be patronising foreign goods when its youths creatively produce such goods.
READ ALSO: The NYSC uniform controversy
The NYSC boss, therefore, urged Nigerians to patronise local manufacturers and assist them to strengthen their economy.
'We should produce what we consume. We have the best skills in the world. You have seen from the exhibition we had here the production of shoes, hats, clothings and other things.
'We have seen also those in agro-allied, food production and processing.
'We cannot be deceiving ourselves, no nation develops on importation.
The life of a nation depends on the skills of its citizens and none develops beyond the citizens' skills.
'So NYSC is changing Nigeria's narrative by developing the skills of these corps members and they are becoming job creators, instead of job seekers.
'A lot of NYSC members are contributing to the economic development of our nation.
'This is the only way we can move forward, we cannot continue to deceive ourselves,' Ikaka said.
He said that corps members had learnt to write business proposals, given loan windows with Bank of Industry offering N2 billon, Central Bank providing N400 million, Heritage Bank fund, NYSC Foundation fund and Credit Direct fund.
He said with about N10 million available for corps members to access, it will be easy for them to succeed outside the service and improve Nigeria's economy.
The state NYSC Coordinator, Lady Bona Fasakin, said that Osisioma Local Government Area (LGA) had been partners in progress with NYSC.
Fasakin said that the council provided the land, where the centre was built, adding that by that act the council had keyed into the vision of the scheme in its fight against unemployment.
She urged other councils and stakeholders in Abia to emulate Osisioma's example by providing skills training equipment to sustain the vision and ensure that corps members become job providers.
She further called for support for NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers so that rural dwellers would benefit from the programme.
The Transition Chairman of Osisioma LGA, Mr Ugochukwu Nwaogu, said the council would continue to assist in making life better for the corps members serving in the area.
Nwaogu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Joseph Iguodo, said the council would seek ways to provide a lodge for corps members in the area.
The council boss pledged N50,000 donation to support NYSC programmes in the area.
The Local Government Zonal Inspector, Mrs Ruth Jacob, thanked the council for its support, while commending the corps members for their commitment in actualising the project.
Jacob said that the centre had taught the corps members how to produce many items that could enhance their economy and contribute to the nation's socio-economic development.
(Updated) Supreme court removes prominent Oyo monarch, Eleruwa of Eruwa
Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola
By Adeola Badru
Twenty-one years after he ascended the throne of his forebears, the Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola has been dethroned by the Supreme Court on Friday morning.
Vanguard recalls that an Oyo State High Court had on January 26, 2011 removed.
But not satisfied, he appealed the judgement.
The sacked monarch was installed the Eleruwa in 1998 by the Oyo State Government amidst protracted protests by members of the rightful ruling house after the last Eleruwa, the late Oba Bolanle Olaniyan, who is from the Akalako ruling house, passed on , on May 1, 1994.
Although his nomination and selection by the kingmakers were challenged by the Laribikusi house, which argued that he was not a member of the ruling arm, but belonged to Akalako where the previous king emerged, the state government went ahead to inaugurate him, prompting the present action.

Those who challenged the authenticity of Adegbola's claims to the throne are Mr. James Olatunde Idowu and Alhaji Ajao.
Joined in the suit besides Adegbola are: the Governor of Oyo State, the Attorney General, Ibarapa Local Government, Chief Jacob Adewusi, Chief Femi Atanda, Chief Idowu Okeowo, Chief E. Ojebisi and Mr. Kasali I.
The plaintiffs, represented by the lawyer, Alhaji Lasun Sanusi (SAN) sought eight reliefs in their statement of claims which were all granted by the court.
Having summarized all the submissions of the counsel to both sides, Justice Abimbola resolved all the issues in favour of the plaintiffs.
When Nigeria's slow wheel of justice caught up with Uzor Kalu
After a 12-year trial period, Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, was yesterday brought to book for offences committed against his people.
In the wake of Nigeria's return to democratic governance in 1999, Kalu was one of the governors elected to steer the affairs of the states of the federation and help fulfill the yearnings of the masses for purposeful governance and true development.
But amid actions that simulated development and got praise singers christening him 'the messiah,' he plundered the state's till, grossly under-developed his people and set the tone for their sustained impoverishment.
Shortly after stepping down as governor in 2007, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) took him to court on a 39-count charge bordering on diversion of about N7.65 billion from the state's purse.
And yesterday, after a drawn trial, he was handed a 12-year jail sentence at a Federal High Court in Lagos by presiding judge, Mohammed Idris, for money laundering.
In addition to the sentence, Justice Idris ordered that Kalu's company, Slok Nigeria Limited, be liquidated and its assets forfeited to the Federal Government.
The senator, Slok Nigeria Limited and Udeh Udeogu, a former director of finance and accounts in Abia, were found complicit in the diversion.

Betty Akeredolu: We'll not relent until women are treated fairly
The wife of Ondo State governor, Arabinrin Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has vowed not to relent until women are given equal rights as their male counterparts.
Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday during the 2nd summit of Forum for Women Officials of Ondo State and Female Appointees (FOWOSO) held at International Culture and Event Centre in Akure, the state capital.
'We will not faint until we see women everywhere being treated with as much respect as their male counterparts.
'The pursuit of gender quality is definitely daunting, many rocks of stereotypes are particularly exerting, but when men join us, we are further strengthened to prevail quickly. But, whatever the case , we shall prevail,' she said.
She called for gender inclusiveness in all aspects of the socio-economic, saying that ' spectrum is still miles ahead. We know this and we are not going to relent.'
Anyanwu-Akeredolu, who is the founder of FOWOSO, noted that her motivation was not because she is a woman.
She called for a society where continuous development was achieved and sustained.
'We must come to the understanding that everyone, regardless of gender is needed for sustainable development.
'I have dedicated my life to driving gender equality, not because I love female folk more ,but because I seek the growth and advancement of humanity as a whole.
'I am very delighted to know that I have infected every FOWOSO member with this positive virus that strives for gender equality in every aspect of our socio-economic spectrum,' she explained.
Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described as unquantifiable the training and empowerment of women in the state by FOWOSO.
He said the activities of the forum, particularly in the areas of training and empowerment of women across the 18 local government areas, had produced many entrepreneurs.
Speaking on the theme of the summit; 'Prioritising Women's Health and Well Being In Nigeria', Akeredolu said his administration had prioritised the well-being of women in the state.
He added: 'We have prioritised women health and well-being in Ondo State and that was what led to the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health Scheme which we launched on Wednesday. All you need to access the free health care for pregnant women is your residency cards. Every child under 5 is entitled to free health care in Ondo State.'
'Let me commend the efforts of the founder for this laudable initiative geared towards the development of womenfolk in Ondo State,' Akeredolu stated.
The Chairman of 2nd FOWOSO Planning Committee, Mrs Mercy Femi-Idris, described the forum as significant to health and welfare of women, adding that it was about nurturing and empowering female folks.
Prof. Modupe Adelabu, the Chairman of the occasion, noted that FOWOSO had given women voice of recognition.
Adelabu, the former director governor of Ekiti State, said the forum had eliminated discrimination against women, noting that FOWOSO was a fun-making gathering but a life-impacful organisation.
Mrs Bisi Fayemi, the wife of Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi and Mrs Kafayat Oyetola, the wife of Osun State governor attended the summit.
How to boost cyber security ‚Äì experts
Stakeholders the Nigerian cyber security space under the aegis of the Information Security Society of Africa-Nigeria (ISSAN) have called for collaborations in boosting cyber security in the country.
They made the call while speaking at a Cyber Security Workshop Themed: 'DDoS Evolution ‚Äì Staying Protected' organised by ISSAN in collaboration with 21st Century Technologies Limited in Lagos.
While welcoming stakeholders at the Workshop, President of ISSAN, Dr. David Isiavwe, decried the worsening state of cyber security in the country.
He said, 'Those who watch the cyber space closely, will all agree that there is a lot of happenings each and every day.
New forms of attacks are being contrived and implemented by the bad guys, and all they need is one successful attempt.
We hear of all the various attacks both on individuals and companies alike.
Indeed, even the cyber security gatekeepers are not spared.
And huge sums of money are at risk each time there is a successful attack.'
Dr. Isiavwe who is also the Group Head Operations & Technology, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, further lamented the fact that everyone and every institution was susceptible to these attacks as social engineering attack is unrelenting.
He said data based manipulation-insiders and outsiders is on the rise, attack on card data and card processing technology infrastructure via rogue IT infrastructure, spear phishing attack and combination of different methodologies were rampant.
He therefore called on all stakeholders to be proactive, create customer awareness activities, continuous and automated monitoring of systems and infrastructure, employment of Artifucial intelligence and Machine Learning as well as robotics and data analytics.
He also called for collaborations among stakeholders.
Speaking on the theme of the workshop in a keynote address, Long Lee Shih ‚Äì DDoS Security Expert, Nexusguard Ltd, also explained how individuals and organisations could avoid being victims of cyber attacks, including Origin Protection (OP) for large networks, among others.
His keynote address was followed by a robust plenary session that included Dr Wale Obadare, MD/COO, Digital Encode Ltd; Long Lee Shih, Ighoakpo Eduje, Chief Information Security Officer, Heritage Bank Ltd; Igboa Abumere, Chief Information Security Officer, Stanbic IBTC Bank; Bharat Soni, Chief Information Security Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Dr. David Isiavwe.
Hit-and-run driver kills woman in Awka
A yet to be identified woman was on Sunday killed by a hit-and-run driver in Awka.
The accident occurred at about 11:05pm at Regina Caeli Junction on the Enugu-Onitsha expressway.
According to Mr Andrew Kumapayi, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra, the accident left the woman dead instantly.
Kumapayi said the corpse had been deposited at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital morgue, Awka.
The sector commander reiterated the call for pedestrians to be careful on the road, especially during festive periods, because of increased vehicular movement.
'My advice to road users especially pedestrians during this season is to be extra careful when crossing the road.
'They should endeavour to use the pedestrian bridge provided for them if any, and if there is none, they should look left, right and left again to make sure that the road is free before crossing.
'Let them wear reflective clothes when walking in the night so that they can be seen by oncoming vehicles,' he said.
What Onitsha fire tells us about the petrol tankers from hell [Pulse Opinion]
The Onitsha fire accident was totally avoidable. Yet again, Nigeria has killed citizens whose only crime was hustling in a country that never got their backs.
Onitsha, the Anambra state capital, is mourning. And all of Nigeria with it.
On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, a petrol laden tanker rammed into buildings in an Onitsha market, spilled its contents in the neigborhood and sparked a fire that ravaged buildings, consumed goods worth millions of Naira and ended lives.
Onitsha was a ball of fire for hours and no one lifted a finger. The city is still counting its losses.
The casualty figures from the incident are still hazy at the time of writing, but it has been confirmed that a mother and her child were among the dead;
With the fire searing through their skins and leaving them locked in each other's arms until the very end.
The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable. I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,' said President Muhammadu Buhari.
Former Nigeria Vice President and presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said: 'We've had many preventable fuel tanker tragedies.
I received with sadness, reports of a tanker explosion in Onitsha, Anambra State, which caused massive destruction to lives and properties in Ochanja Market area.
My prayers and thoughts are with the families of the affected.'
TV personality Ebuka Obi-Uchendu said: 'Last night was a lot.
We really are on our own in this country.
Those images from Onitsha are still so heartbreaking.
May the departed Rest In Peace.'
One of the biggest takeaways from the tragedy is that the fire raged for hours with no fire service truck anywhere near the scene of the inferno.
And like Atiku mentioned, this is one of several petrol tanker accidents in recent times across Nigeria that has led to loss of lives.
Apart from the Otedola bridge fire incident of June 2018 in Lagos that led to loss of lives and the burning of cars, there have been several instances where a petrol laden tanker, flouting all known traffic laws in the land, goes ahead to inflict pain and misery on innocent families and ordinary Nigerians.
In Lagos where this writer resides, petrol tanker and articulated truck drivers derive immense joy from intimidating other road users, offloading their containers on busy roads and obstructing free flow of traffic.
Articulated trucks and petrol tankers have been a menace in Nigeria for as long as anyone can remember and the regulatory agencies or authorities have largely looked the other way unperturbed for decades.
Until the next disaster.
'I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies.
May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen,' President Buhari said, without stating how he will make sure the agencies he mentioned sanitize our roads and put the killer truck drivers in check.
Without saying how he'll lead the charge in enforcing compliance.
It is also a shame that a state as rich as Anambra has no functioning fire service department or emergency response units; and that when tragedy struck, Governor Willie Obiano was not on the ground to provide succour.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Onitsha inferno was completely avoidable. Yet again, we have lost lives to poor governance across all tiers. Writer Ayo Sogunro was right after all when he said 'everything in Nigeria is going to kill you.'

Michael added that she had remained without a job since sustaining a career-threatening injury five years ago while playing for the club.
She disclosed that no form of help came from the management of the Ondo State Football Agency since that period.
She said, 'For almost five years after I was injured and spent my entire earnings on treating myself, I have had no job.
'We are therefore appealing to Ondo State Government to help us out.
'I played almost five years for this team, the injury I had, government and management didn't help me. So, they should pay us our money.'
Former Sunshine Stars player, James Moses, said government should honour the agreement it entered into with the players and pay them their sign-on fees.
Moses, fondly called 'Okomu' in his playing days by fans, said the love they had for the team had prevented them from taking legal action against the management.
He said, 'The state has been owing us sign-on fees for long and we have been begging for them to pay us.
'Sunshine was my first club, I love Sunshine so much. I want them to pay us our money that is due to us.
'We are calling on the state governor to help us because some of us have families to take care of.'
In his reaction, Tajudeen Akinyemi, Chairman, Ondo State Football Agency, said the previous government agreed to pay the money in 15 instalments but was only able to offset eight.
Akinyemi said the file for the remaining seven months had been sent to the Head of Service, who had raised the issue with the governor of the state.
He promised that government would accelerate action on the file to ensure that the former players were paid.

EXCLUSIVE: Davido: 'No Money Osun State Can Make In 40 Years That My Dad Hasn't Made'
*Why I stayed away from Nigeria for 8 months
Nigerian singer David Adeleke, aka Davido, says there is no money Osun State can make in the next 40 years that his father, Adedeji Adeleke, has not already made as the 'omo baba olowo' crooner revealed why he stayed away from Nigeria for eight months.
A similar controversial statement regarding the paltry financial capacity of Osun was made by the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.
Contrary to beliefs that Davido was away from the country to promote his music on the international scene, the singer said he had to leave the country of some time due to the fillers he was getting that the government was after him.
According to him, he needed to protect his family and associates which he was why he left the country.
The singer made this known at his album private listening event, Wednesday night, which held at Landmark Events, Victoria Island, where he disclosed that if he had chosen to stay things would not have gone smoothly for him as the government were beginning to track his activities.
The singer whose album, 'A Good Time', will be released in October while fielding questions from MTV Base TV host, Ehiz, said, 'With the whole politics thing it was first about family.
Honestly, it was first about family.
I was in Osun with my guys.
We saw everything in plain sight.
Let me tell you a story about my uncle.
My uncle is the last born of the family.
The original politician of the family is Serubawon, my father's elder brother.
'He was the first governor of Osun state; came back then went for senator you know when everybody for the state knows that this is the next governor and then we just woke up one day and they said he went to eat somewhere and he died.
'Yoruba culture when somebody holds an office and he passes on they either give the bride or the close relatives.
The next in line is B red's daddy and he is just a happy person.
He doesn't like politics but when you lose your brother everybody knows what's up.
With that, they wanted to give my uncle automatically.
'A day to them swearing him in as senator they said no we want to do re-election another guy has come up and my father doesn't like wahala so he said let's go to the other party if we lose we pack our thing and go.
The next day we did election my uncle cleared 16 out of 17 local government areas.
'He became a senator in just a week.
His own journey to winning that governorship primary election was out of sight that was how we knew this one nah God.
'It was painful and will tell everybody here that was the real reason I was not even in the country because of the politics.
I have to watch what I say.
If I was around he no go dey OK for me and my people.
So I had to be a man and say look let me stay away.
'We have Adeleke University all the roads that lead was done by my father.
There's no money Osun wants to make in the next 30 to 40 years that my father has not made.
The way things turned out was crazy.
When asked if he got any backlash for doing what he did, he said no.
According to him, he met an APC chieftain at a wedding in Paris wherethey both shared a joke.
He said he 'felt shebi una don take am'.
That's why I'm back, he explained.
'I'm praying every day for the country.
Everybody is complaining why you talking about politics.
I have an American passport I could have chosen to stay there.
But this is home and I am comfortable here.'
EXCLUSIVE: EFCC Quizzes Ondo Poly Bursar, Registrar Over Funds Misappropriation
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has quizzed the Registrar of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic Owo, Ondo State, Mr Sule Atiku, and the Bursar of the institution, Mr Matthew Adejuwon, over alleged financial impropriety.
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
A source, who confided in our correspondent, said that, 'The Registrar and Bursar of the institution were at the EFCC on Tuesday and they were quizzed over the role they played in allegedly misappropriating the funds of the institution.
'They were there with their lawyers and brought some documents to defend themselves.
'Our investigations showed that the Bursar had his authorised signature on some of the documents which also implicated him as an accomplice.
Two of them (Bursar and the Registrar) were accomplices in the ongoing corruption and fraud perpetrated at the polytechnic.
A senior management officer of the school also confirmed the questioning of the two men during a chat SaharaReporters.
He said, 'Yes, it is true that the two men have honoured the invite of the EFCC and they have been quizzed but I don't know if they were detained.
I noticed I did not see them in school today (Wednesday).
When contacted on Wednesday evening over the matter, spokesperson for the institution, Mr Ojo Samuel, could not be reached as his telephone line was switched off.
Recall that the EFCC had last month invited and quizzed both the Chairman, Governing Board of the school, Mr Banji Alabi; the Rector, Gani Ogundahunsi; Deputy Rector (Academics), and Mr Olorunwa Lawson after a petition was received by the agency.
Some aggrieved lecturers of the school had accused the management of the institution of allegedly diverting and using some illegal means to misappropriate the school's fund into private purse.
Sources at the EFCC had earlier told SaharaReporters that there are documents linking the principal officers of the polytechnic to the financial misappropriation.
EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason I was Assaulted ‚ÄìFUTA Student Brutalised By Colleagues.
She was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.
Boluwatife Adekunle, the female undergraduate of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, who was physically assaulted by two ladies and a guy all said to be student of the institution, has given more insight into why she was attacked.
The young lady, who says she wants justice served, told SaharaReporters on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, that she was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.
Adekunle revealed that she was assaulted in one of the private hostels outside the school campus by the group in a bid to be disgraced among fellow students.
She said, 'The whole issue started few weeks ago.
I and one of the ladies in the video called 'Faith' were roommates in a hostel outside campus.
'Her boyfriend began asking me out but I felt it was not proper for me to date him.
I rejected his advances.
'But instead of him to leave me alone, the guy kept disturbing me, so I had to report him to Faith because I don't want trouble.
FUTA Female Student Brutalised For Calling Colleagues 'Runs Girls'
'Before then, I had been having some issues with Faith as she had been living a wayward life on campus which I didn't like.
'From that point, she started seeing me as talking bad about her to people around our area.
'During this period, her boyfriend kept pestering me to date him but I refused.
'Instead of Faith to caution her boyfriend, she accused me of planning to sleep with her man.
'On the day that I was assaulted, she invited me to a room in one of the hostels and boyfriend and other ladies were inside the place already.
'Immediately I entered the place, they locked the door and asked me to kneel down while the guy was asking if he ever asked me for a date.
'Since I refused to kneel down, they began to beat me and also tried to strip me naked.
'They used a stick to hit me on my head and punched me on my face.
The guy used horse whip to flog me several times.
'They said they would make sure they disgraced me on campus, I pleaded with them but they refused and I was about to faint when they stopped beating me.
'As I speak, I feel pains all over my body due to the beatings.
Their plan was to kill me.
I want them arrested and face the consequences of their action.'
While condemning the attack on her daughter, the victim's mother, Mrs Florence Adekunle, said they wanted justice over the matter.
Former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, and rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known as Segalink, have condemned the expulsion of a student of Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, over a Facebook post, an open letter to the Inspector-General of Police and his alliance with pro-democracy and human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore.
Shehu Sani, who took to his Twitter handle to express his grievance, said, 'Expelling students and sacking workers over Facebook or Twitter postings is likely to intensify in view of the growing culture of intolerance to criticisms and the establishment discomfort with the social media.'
Also reacting to the issue, Segalink wrote, 'By the grace of God, we shall be taking up this case.
The level of impunity in our citadel of knowledge is astronomical.
An example will be made of this abuse of power by people who should know better.
Kindly advise Ifemosu Michael to reach out, so we can be properly briefed and take up the matter for justice to be served.
He is no longer alone.
However, despite the outcry the expulsion of Ifemosu by on the orders of the Vice Chancellor, Prof Felix Salako, the university's management are yet to give any statement on the issue.
Expose Prostitutes In Your Locality, Hisbah Tells Kano Residents
Commander-General of the Board, Sheikh Harun Ibn-Sina, was said to have made the call while addressing women apprehended for roaming the city at night.
Kano Hisbah corps
Residents of Kano have been urged to expose prostitutes in their localities so that immoral activities can be curbed.
In a statement on Wednesday by its Public Relations Officer, Alhaji Lawan Ibrahim, the Kano State Hisbah Board said that the move would lead to speedy development of the state.
Commander-General of the Board, Sheikh Harun Ibn-Sina, was said to have made the call while addressing women apprehended for roaming the city at night.
He said, 'Those apprehended during the Hisbah corps patrol were young girls.
'The raids were carried out at Church Road Sabon Gari, Railway quarters, Tukur Road in Nassarawa GRA and Sarkin Yaki Road in Kano.
'To achieve optimum result in its set programmes and policies, the board had set up 24-hour desk officers to handle any form of security report from the general public.
'All reports will be treated with utmost confidence and urged people in the state to always be law abiding citizens.'
Ibn-Sina however, said that the arrested women would be counselled before being handed them over to their parents.
FC Ifeanyi Uba Players Attacked By Armed Robbers Along Kabba Road
Driver of the bus conveying the team was said to have been shot while some members of the coaching crew and players were critically injured.
Players of FC Ifeanyi Uba have been attacked by armed robbers operating along Kabba Road near Lokoja in Kogi State.
A statement by the management of the club on Friday said that the players were travelling to Kano for their scheduled NPFL matchday 6 fixture against Jigawa Golden Stars when they ran into a group of armed robbers dressed in NYSC uniforms.
Driver of the bus conveying the team was said to have been shot while some members of the coaching crew and players were critically injured.
Some of the victims were said to be receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the state.
The statement reads, 'This is to inform the general public that at about 1:30pm today, players of FC Ifeanyi Ubah travelling to Kano for their scheduled NPFL matchday 6 fixture against Jigawa Golden Stars ran into a group of armed robbers dressed in NYSC uniforms near Lokoja in Kogi State.'
The club called on the government as well as football regulatory bodies including the Nigerian Football Federation and League Management Company to intensify security on roads across the country.
Federal Polytechnic Ado Ekiti Bans Students Unionism Over Protest
The students' body had accused the school's management of plotting to install a stooge, who would do the management's bidding as their leader.
The management of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, has shut down the school following students' protest over the interference of the school's authorities in the running of the Students Union Government.
Consequently, the management also banned all SUG activities in school until further notice.
The students' body had accused the school's management of plotting to install a stooge, who would do the management's bidding as their leader.
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the protest by the students disrupted normal academic activities and vehicular movement in and out of the school.
Some valuable facilities in the institution's School of Engineering were also destroyed.
The institution's Director of Protocol, Information and Public Relations, Adeyemi Adejolu, in a statement issued in Ado Ekiti on Sunday, denied the students' claims that authorities were interfering with the union's affairs.
He also described as needless and unwarranted the violent protest by the students, saying their action was based on mere rumour from unreliable sources, adding that the school's management had nothing to gain from imposing candidates in students' union election.
According to him, the decision to shut the polytechnic was arrived at during an emergency joint meeting of the Academic Board and Management Committee held on Saturday.
For Femi Falana and Kunle Ajibade: Sixty Hurrahs to Courage and Conviction By Ogaga Ifowodo
These two tribunes of truth and justice recently marked their sixtieth anniversary in a beautiful land made almost unliveable on any proper index of healthy living, where the average life expectancy is a bleak fifty-four years, placing us behind 215 other countries in the world and 15 in Africa.
They can't hear me, but I am shouting sixty hurrays in the first instance, and sixty more (for I wish them a very long life), in tribute to their extraordinary courage.
Dr. Ogaga Ifowodo
I was twenty-three and in the first semester of my final year as a law student at the University of Benin.
He was thirty and already a rising star in the legal profession, though still under the wing of the urbane but ever battle-ready Alao Aka-Bashorun.
I had recently ceased to be Secretary-General of the Students Union and Opeyemi Bamidele (now literally taking the bullets of enemies of democracy in our land) newly sworn in as the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, pending the election to constitute a new executive.
And it was the matter of the election that led to my 'indefinite suspension' ‚Äî along with Bamidele and two others, in the first instance (eight more followed suit, besides the president of the union) ‚Äî thereby almost confirming my father's fear the day I informed him of my intention to run for a Students Union office: that I did not intend to graduate!
Still smarting from our victory in the fight for the restoration of the union at Uniben ‚Äî following the unconstitutional ban on student union activities in the wake of the nationwide protests sparked by the murder of four Ahmadu Bello University students by anti-riot policemen precipitately called to quell a peaceful protest (Professor Ango Abdullahi, the vice chancellor, would further outrage the nation by announcing that 'only four students died' as if one were not too many) ‚Äî Professor Grace Alele-Williams sought to pacify her campus for General Babangida, the reigning military dictator, by issuing intolerable election guidelines.
Candidates were to submit their manifestoes for vetting; were not to use university policy as a campaign issue;
must not belong to campus associations (this aimed at disqualifying members of the 'banned' League of Patriotic Students, resurrected as the Cultural Awareness Club, our group);
possession of a minimum Grade Point Average of 2.75; and disqualification without reason.
Why call it an election, you might ask, but we were then in the early years of Babangida's political witchcraft, hence his dying need to pacify the campuses by emasculating the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), arguably the only organised opposition at the time to the burgeoning military terror. Our suspension was punishment for rallying the students against the obnoxious guidelines, for calling 'on students to boycott' the elections and ‚Äî of course, they had to add this ‚Äî 'incit[ing] them to violence and demonstration.'
But that was hardly our only crime.
At the time of the second petrol price increase by Babangida from 39.5 kobo to 42 kobo per litre ‚Äî yes, the national currency did have value once upon a time! ‚Äî the union had barely been inaugurated and so we lacked the platform for an effective protest, with the University of Jos, I believe, leading the way then.
Then Babangida gave us a chance to salve our festering wound of non-participation: the students unions of the universities that shunned 'violence' by not protesting would each be given an eighteen-seater bus to commend their 'maturity.'
Promptly, we made clear what kind of praise or gifts the University of Benin union would accept by holding a rally and rejecting the bribe outright.
But the true test of the union's character followed quickly when the university decided to cancel resit examinations.
Resits gave a second chance, a lifeline even, to struggling students, many of whom were indigent, some constrained to do menial work in town to see themselves through school, and who still had to cope with poor living conditions, and non-existent or inadequate learning materials as libraries and laboratories were sapped to 'death' by the IMF/World Bank's Structural Adjustment Programme, imposed by Babangida on the nation despite its total rejection by the people.
Whatever the merits of the decision, the students would accept it only if living and learning conditions were improved, even if by a mere fifty percent.
The vice-chancellor would not budge and challenged me, as the perceived recalcitrant mouthpiece of the students, to a debate.
The entire university trooped to the quadrangle of the Faculty of Social Sciences to be schooled on how misguided the new students union was.
As it happened, she lost the argument and was constrained to restore resit exams for the time being.
That was the last straw.
Something had to be done.
And so disregarding our request to examine the evidence and witnesses against us, and for adequate time to prepare our response to the charges of holding a rally, and incitement to demonstration and violence, the university proceeded at break-neck speed to hand us what, in effect, were expulsion letters.
I took the query, our responses, and the suspension letters to Femi Falana in Lagos, meeting him at home in Ketu where he lived at the time.
On the principle of fair hearing alone, our suspension would be annulled by the court, but what to do about the ubiquitous cast-iron ouster clauses in the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree, the Federal Military Government (Supremacy and Enforcement of Powers) Decree, recently reiterated in the Students Union Activities (Control and Regulation) Decree 47?
Falana saw a way out.
He would bring to aid the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, already ratified and domesticated, which, as an international treaty, Nigeria was obligated to enforce in her courts.
By sheer coincidence, the late Justice James Omo-Agege of the former Bendel State High Court was assigned the case, Bamidele & Ors v The University of Benin.
He had been one of the resource persons who helped birth the Charter during his time as an expatriate jurist in The Gambia.
He was more than happy to give it life, though the university's failure to adhere to its enabling Act had already simplified the task for him.
He voided our suspension/expulsion.
I lost a semester but returned to complete my LL.B with honours.
Though Professor Alele-Williams would withhold my faculty reference form and prevent my admission into the Nigeria Law School until a month before the bar exam, the battle for my admission waged administratively this time by Mr Aka-Bashorun himself.
He was thirty and I was twenty-three when we first met.
I, a law student with his head in law and his heart in poetry and literature, and he a copy writer with the defunct Grant Advertising at an indifferent address on Bode Thomas Street, Surulere, Lagos.
Kunle Ajibade, would soon after wend his way to the newsrooms of The Guardian, The African Concord, and TheNEWS magazine and Tempo newspaper, the last two as co-founder and editor.
I don't recall precisely the occasion of our first meeting ‚Äî whether the 1988 Association of Nigerian Authors annual conference at the National Theatre or on one of my many truant jaunts to Lagos to attend this or that reading ‚Äî but whichever it was, I suspect that I was introduced by the late poet Idzia Ahmad, Ajibade's colleague at Grant.
It was in his days at The African Concord, however, that I really got to know Ajibade.
With the encouragement of Lewis Obi, its editor, and Ohi Alegbe, copy editor, I had begun contributing articles to its pages.
And then in 1993 I won the Association of Nigerian Authors poetry prize with an unpublished manuscript, what became Homeland and Other Poems.
Ajibade who had begun a series of long interviews of established authors for Weekend Concord, was, it seemed, almost as delighted as my euphoric self and interviewed me for his report as if I were already a bona fide poet, thereby doing wonders for my budding writer's ego!
But literature is one thing and real life another.
And so it was that soon after that we would both be in the trenches during the vicious days of the Babangida/Abacha tyranny that culminated in the cruellest evil perpetrated against democracy and our sovereign right to self-determination: the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election.
Jailed for life, he was, by a military tribunal set up to confirm verdicts already reached before the charges were framed.
Ajibade's offence had been no more than publishing General Obasanjo's statement in denial of the ridiculous charge of accessory before the fact of treason, making Ajibade's offence purportedly that of being an accessory after the fact of treason!
Whenever anyone quite solicitously wondered how I coped with six months of preventive detention, I always said that I got away lightly and would cite Ajibade among other human rights and democracy activists given life imprisonment sentences, or who had spent well over a year in the Babangida/Abacha gulag, Ajibade having done three-and-a-half years before freedom came in the wake of his jailer's death.
I was amused when Ngugi wa Thiong'o conceded to Ajibade the status of 'older jailbird' during a conversation with him at the 2016 Ake Arts and Book festival in Abeokuta because he had himself spent only one year in Arap Moi's prison.
Jailed for life, but the people on whose side he fought, as the rest of the world, hailed him for a life courageously lived.
As they hail Falana who in those days walked through revolving doors to prison cells and SSS dungeons.
Among his peers and even succeeding generations, Falana stands tall as a people's solicitor and advocate, insisting on seeing law as a tool of social engineering rather than merely as a genteel profession of self-satisfied practitioners, best served without a conscience, by keeping silent in the face of tyranny or, even better, taking the side of diabolical governments.
For his part, Ajibade was editor of Tempo, the underground newspaper set up by TheNEWS crew after their magazine had been proscribed.
These two tribunes of truth and justice recently marked their sixtieth anniversary in a beautiful land made almost unliveable on any proper index of healthy living, where the average life expectancy is a bleak fifty-four years, placing us behind 215 other countries in the world and 15 in Africa.
They can't hear me, but I am shouting sixty hurrays in the first instance, and sixty more (for I wish them a very long life), in tribute to their extraordinary courage.

FG Should Stop Subjecting Sowore To Media Trial By Femi Falana
The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.
But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.
When Mr Omoyele Sowore was arrested on August 3 , 2019, the State Security Service accused him of engaging in terrorist activities.
On the basis of the allegation, the SSS obtained an order from the Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja to detain Sowore for 45 days in order to investigate his alleged terrorist activities.
But at the end of the investigation, he was not linked to terrorism in any way.
Hence, he was not charged with any offence under the Terrorism Prevention Act, 2011 as amended.
The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.
But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.
Even though the allegations of terrorism and treasonable felony against Sowore had collapsed like a pack of cards, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), engaged in a face-saving measure by charging him and Olawale Bakare with treasonable felony for planning to organise public protests against the Buhari administration.
Not sure that the charge of treasonable felony would succeed in the court, the AGF proceeded to charge Sowore with cyberstalking for allegedly insulting President Buhari in a television interview and money laundering.
Meanwhile, the organisers of the public protests, which were held in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River and Osun states were charged with unlawful assembly.
The case filed in Ogun State has been dismissed while the defendants have been discharged following the no case submission of the defence counsel, Mr. Effiong Inibehe.
The defendants in the other cases have been granted bail pending trial by the various magistrate courts.
Having met the bail conditions they have regained their freedom.
But the orders of Justice Taiwo and Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare were ignored with impunity by the SSS.
Although the SSS complied with the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare within 24 hours' ultimatum, its operatives turned round to manhandle Sowore in the well of the court and later rearested him without any warrant of arrest.
However, because of the gravity of the charge pending at the Federal High Court, the presiding Judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had ordered the prosecutor to make available to the defendants the statements of all prosecution witnesses while the case was fixed for definite hearing on the 5th and 6th, December, 2019.
But on account of the refusal of the SSS to comply with the order of Justice Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare on bail, the defendants were unable to prepare their case.
As the SSS refused to comply with the order of court to produce the statements of the prosecution witnesses the case has been further adjourned to February 20, 2020 at the instance of the prosecution counsel.
For wasting the precious time of the trial court, the prosecutor was ordered to pay N100,000 to the defendants in accordance with section 296 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015.
The prosecutor has since paid the said cost.
It is therefore embarrassing that the Federal Government which has found it difficult to prove its case in a competent court of law has resorted to the media trial of Sowore.
Thus, in a press statement on Sunday, December 8, 2019, a presidential spokesperson, Mr Garba Shehu claimed that 'Sowore called for a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria.'
In comparing Sowore with the Boko Haram sect, the Presidency said, 'Nigeria is already dealing with an insurgency that has left millions of people displaced and desperate in the North-East region of country.
The Boko Haram militants, who are behind the violence, also fancy themselves to be fighting for some sort of revolution.
The link is a justification for the planned arraignment of Sowore for terrorism.
Since it is common knowledge that Sowore and Bakare are not among the well known merchants of violence and coup plotters that had successfully but illegally removed democratically elected governments in Nigeria, we are not going to join issues with Mr Shehu over the highly contemptuous statements credited to him.
But as a senior journalist, Mr Shehu ought to have known that it is highly unprofessional to subject a man held incommunicado to scurrilous attacks in the media.
We are however, convinced that Sowore will have a right of reply once the fundamental rights of the Nigerian people are restored.
Even though the Federal Government has failed to engage in the diligent prosecution of the serious case, the Presidency has resorted to media trial while the charge of treasonable felony is allowed to hang menacingly on the heads of our clients.
We are however, not going to be tempted to join issues with the Presidency over a case that is pending before a properly constituted court of law.
If the Presidency is so sure that our clients committed treasonable felony or any other offence whatsoever, it should keep its powder dry and advise the prosecution to commence the trial without any further delay.
Fire Burns 12 Corpses Inside Obafemi Awolowo University Morgue
She said no life was lost to the incident but about 12 corpses kept in the cabin inside the morgue were affected.
About 12 corpses were on Tuesday burnt in an early morning fire that razed the morgue of Anatomy Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State, according to a report by PUNCH.
Spokesperson for the Osun Police Command, Folasade Odoro, confirmed the incident.
She said no life was lost to the incident but about 12 corpses kept in the cabin inside the morgue were affected.
Odoro added that the detectives from the command were already investigating the cause of the incident.
Public Relations Officer of the university, Abiodun Olanrewaju, in a statement said about 102 bodies were kept in the morgue when the fire caused by power surge started around 3:00am on Tuesday.
He said, 'The fire, which broke out at 3:00am today (Tuesday, November 19, 2019) was caused by electricity surge which affected a section of the morgue where corpses are kept.
'Out of about 102 bodies kept in the morgue, 12 were affected by the fire outbreak.
'The department has made detailed arrangements to duly and adequately inform those who have kept bodies (corpses) in the morgue.'
Five Lessons Learnt From Anthony Joshua's Comeback Victory By Samuel Osho
Our fears are as strong as the belief we put in them.
Joshua stepped into the ring and used his fears to his advantage;
he faced his demons and punched them until they got exhausted.
The suspense in the misty air of Diriyah Arena turned to an atmosphere of celebration as Nigerian-born British heavyweight boxer, Anthony Joshua, reclaims his titles.
Joshua's tense rematch with Andy Ruiz remains one of the most significant moments in 2019 for the world of boxing.
Andy Ruiz stunned the world six months ago at the Madison Square Garden in New York after a big upset that ended in a technical knockout.
Ruiz, an underdog, knocked Joshua to the canvass four times before the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round after a flurry of punches.
On that night, Ruiz made history as the first boxer of Mexican descent to become a heavyweight title winner.
In Saturday night's rematch, the world saw a different Anthony Joshua with rare mettle and prowess required for success in the boxing ring.
His athleticism, technicalities, and sportsmanship were on display as the world stood still to watch a resilient fighter reclaim his lost titles.
It was an emotional moment for Joshua, who had a sweet return to the number one spot in the heavyweight boxing division.
He won in style and became a two-time world heavyweight champion with a unanimous victory over Andy Ruiz.
During the build-up to the match, there were fears if Joshua had the mental fortitude to fight his demons and go for a win.
On Saturday, he reassured his teeming fans and answered lots of questions.
Those answers came with quick jabs, timely hooks, and calculated movements, all delivered in a 36 minutes show of clinical finish.
With the comeback victory, Joshua joined Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Floyd Patterson and Mike Tyson in the league of men to have reclaimed the world heavyweight title.
In this historical moment, there are lessons to learn from a man that came back from the dead to knock out the same person that gifted him his first career defeat.

Ahead of his much-anticipated fight with Ruiz in Saudi Arabia, Joshua paid homage to his Nigerian roots.
The British boxer with Nigerian parents chose a tune by Nigerian multi-talented musician, Fela Kuti, as his entrance song.
The song, Water No Get Enemy by Fela, a trailblazer of Afrobeat music and a fearless human rights activist, was perfect for the occasion and a precursor for a historic night.
During Joshua's visit to Nigeria in July, he stopped by at Fela's shrine in Lagos, where Femi Kuti showed him around.
This victorious match reminded everyone of Fela's undying legacy.
Stay hungry for a win
There are no friends in the ring, and the best way to come out of the ring victorious is by inflicting damage on the opponent.
In the first match in New York, it was apparent that Joshua lacked the hunger needed for victory.
After hitting the canvas in the third round, Joshua appeared lost and uncoordinated; he struggled through the remaining rounds before the referee waved the fight off.
In the rematch, it was evident that Joshua was hungry for a victory.
He was there to prove a point and retrieve his lost belts that were on exile in California.
The hunger reflected in the superb head and body movement aimed at dodging Ruiz's punches.
If there were anything Joshua learned after his defeat, it would be to stay hungry in the face of any opposition.
Stick to the game plan
Before his first match with Ruiz, everyone was used to Joshua decapitating his opponents before the final round with an exception for the bout with Joseph Parker.
For many of the fans, they wanted to see an angry Joshua in the ring with a shower of punches to revenge his humiliating loss in June.
It was not a big ask from a man that has 21 knockouts out of 22 professional wins.
Let the 'champ' do the magic again.
While that seems like a brilliant plan that could drive the fans wild, it would have placed Joshua in a vulnerable position resulting in a second defeat.
It would have been a blatant display power without tactfulness.
It is quite understandable if the critics wanted a spectacular match, but often, the key to victory is taking calculated risks and not doing what everyone expects.
Joshua understood the difference between showmanship and professionalism.
He took the stance of a professional pugilist and displayed a tactical understanding of the sport to wear out his opponent.
Boxing is all about taking well-timed punches and avoid getting hit.
That was the game plan, and a disciplined Joshua stuck to the plan from start to finish.
Joshua never allowed Ruiz to lock him a close range that is advantageous to a speedy boxer like Ruiz.
He made use of his long legs by pacing in the ring, which not only frustrated his opponent but prevented Ruiz from landing his punches in a close range.
Those powerful jabs courtesy of Joshua's long-range paid off in the match against his Mexican rival.
Joshua practically animated Mohammed Ali's words, 'Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
The hands can't hit what the eyes can't see.'
Stay focused on the prize
On the road to success, the focus is paramount.
In the build-up to the rematch, Joshua was under immense pressure, and he could not afford a second defeat.
In the ring, it's hard to stay focused on a plan after suffering a devastating hit.
However, it pays to stay focused and avoid any unexpected complications from surprise hooks.
Before the rematch, Joshua was hard on himself with a laser-focused training regimen.
He trimmed his weight to 237 pounds, his lowest in five years (lost 10 pounds in six months).
It takes focus and discipline to do that.
In sharp contrast to Joshua's approach, Andy Ruiz added 16 pounds to his chubby frame, which impacted his movement in the ring.
It's hard to keep up with six months of uninterrupted media attention and sudden fame.
Bouncing back from an embarrassing loss is hard.
But Joshua forgot about the mixed feelings of the past and focused on the next 36 minutes of his life in the ring ‚Äì the moment that decides what happens next in his boxing career.
With eyes on the prize and a heart bent on winning, he earned his titles back amidst cheers and applause from a satisfied audience.
Punch your fears in the face
Preceding the match in New York, Joshua was an undefeated unified heavyweight champion.
Although he had a close shave with defeat in his match against Wladimir Klitschko, he bounced back after a knockdown in the sixth round.
His first taste of defeat in his professional career was against Ruiz in June, and he lost to an underdog that was unknown to anyone before the match.
The fears of losing again must have haunted Joshua in the past few months, but his fighting spirit during the rematch showed the traits of a champion.
Former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, once said, 'Fear is just like fire;
it can be helpful if you know how to use it.
If not, you will get burned.'
Our fears are as strong as the belief we put in them.
Joshua stepped into the ring and used his fears to his advantage; he faced his demons and punched them until they got exhausted.

FLASHBACK: Undercover Investigation: With Just N70, You Can Buy A Pirated Copy Of Genevieve's 'Lionheart'
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, 'Lionheart' has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying it had too much English dialogue.
An undercover investigation by Sahara Reporters in January this year had revealed that the movie whose right was exclusively bought by online streaming platform, Netflix was been pirated in Alaba Markets, Lagos and sold for just N70.
In October, wild reactions trailed the selection of 'Lionheart' by the Nigerian Oscars Selection Committee, NOSC, to represent Nollywood at the 2020 Oscars as there was varying reactions and argument as why the movie should have or not have been selected.
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, 'Lionheart' has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying it had too much English dialogue.
The movie which was directed by ace Nollywood actress, Genevieve Nnaji according to the Los Angeles Times ran afoul of the academy rule which states that an International feature film category must have 'a predominantly non-English dialogue track.'
Amidst all this, we bring to you an investigative report done by us highlighting how deep piracy has eaten into the Nigeria movie industry.
Four Nigerian Footballers Detained For Illegally Entering India
The men were arrested and detained during a search on a train, Indian Express reports.
Four Nigerian footballers en route Guwahati in India have been arrested at Agartala Railway Station.
The men were arrested and detained during a search on a train, Indian Express reports.
Government Railway Police Sub-Inspector, Snehangshu Marak, said, 'We detained them during a search on the train.
'These four people have got valid Nigerian passports and valid visa to Bangladesh.
However, they don't have any travel papers for their entry in India.'
The official said preliminary investigation suggested that the Nigerians illegally entered the Indian territory through Bangladesh.
Some currency notes, four Nigerian passports and North-East Frontier Railway tickets to Guwahati were recovered from them.
Amtali Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Anirban Das, said the GRP hasn't yet handed over the detainees to the police.
#FreeSowore: Chaining A Body Whose Mind Is Free By Modiu Olaguro
The government arrested Sowore in body thinking they could get a hold of his soul.
Those championing #FreeSowore should at least be consoled that no one on earth has the capacity to chain a body whose mind is free.

Sahara Reporters Media
'The young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there's got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change.
And a better world has to be built and the only way it's going to be built is with extreme methods.
And I, for one, will join in with anyone‚Äîdon't care what colour you are‚Äîas long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.'‚ÄîMalcolm X at the Oxford Union in December, 1964.
A couple of weeks after the 2019 presidential elections, I met Omoyele Sowore at the Sahara Reporters' Civic Media Lab and after we exchanged pleasantries in his usual 'hey professor' way, he told me in a sombre tone how travelling across Nigeria during his one year intensive campaigns had made him (upon his brief return to the United States) value things he had hitherto taken for granted having been practically away for twenty years.
Sowore told me how he came to appreciate the leaders of America for the good roads, stable power, modern schools, world-class health care, mortgage facilities, welfare programs, etcetera.
I listened to him with rapt attention and pity as he held the stand of the red water tank inside the compound.
When he was done talking, I said the following words:
Sir, please leave us here with our poverty and return to the states.
Unknown to many, Sowore is rich and comfortable.
His children neither live nor school here.
If I had a twelfth of the opportunity Sowore has, I would have forgotten the location of Nigeria on the world map.
I am writing this as clear as I can with a heavy heart.
Nigerians who are most hit by poverty and hunger have shown the most love to those inflicting those indignities on them.
Although, a friend of his warned that he could dislike me for asking that he leave Nigerians with their poverty, I had to say it nonetheless.
I do not know what could motivate someone as comfortable as 'Sho' to leave his family, job and convenience to fight against base conditions that ordinarily have little effect on him.
Nigeria is a space of dead people.
It is a dangerous black hole where no amount of good manifests as a result of its nature of neutralizing anything worthwhile thrown at it.
The same people castigating Sowore are dying in hunger, writhing in pain and smiling in agony; yet clutch in vain hope, struggling to take a seat on the podium where praises are heaped on the custodians of their chains.
How will a country led by established thieves, certificate forgers and freeloaders appreciate a person like Sowore who created something out of nothing?
How did Nigeria treat Professors Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Pius Adesanmi and Ayodele Awojobi?
Did Awojobi, a genius professor of engineering not threaten to go study law?
Did the Nigerian government not frustrate him that he once broke down in tears in court?
If I had an herbalist, I will not think twice before taking Sowore's name there and cause him to forget the name of his country.
For thirty years since he found his voice, Nigeria has chained, arrested and molested him.
Until two years ago when he overcame the fear of death, he used to sneak in and out of the country.
As it stands, the day I leave this country will be the last I will complain about it.
The argument that there is no place like home holds water when there is one to begin with.
How has Nigeria been made home for Nigerians?
Did the president not say the southeast was not a part of his constituency?
Daily, we live in fear.
Fear of insecurity.
Fear of devaluation of a weak currency.
Fear of war.
Fear of an increase in the pump-price of petrol.
Fear of a social uprising.
Fear of everything.
Anyone resident here with no fear in his/her heart is either dead or delusional.
The reality is that this country will not get better anytime soon‚Äînot with the ruinous path her wicked handlers have intentionally put her.
The thought that the rest of the world left us in the 17th century to move to the 21st is enough to prove my point.
Look around you: from the roads politicians build to the rail, from agriculture to education, and from our hospitals back to our governance system, can you spot a difference between them and those that have been around since the time of Isaac Newton?
Unlike many, Omoyele Sowore is a firm believer in Nigeria and Nigerians.
In July when he met with Nnamdi Kanu, one of the things he told him was his aversion to the snide remarks members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) make against members of other ethnic stock in Nigeria.
Sowore told him everyone outside of the political class is suffering a form of injustice or the other and efforts must be made to speak for all and not to call for the balkanization of the Lugardian Contraption.
Sowore's vision is to have a borderless African continent in the way and manner our Pan-Africanist ancestor, Kwame Nkrumah envisaged.
His positions are on the internet.
Sowore does not and has never advocated for the dissolution of the country although he has a right to do so.
His anger, like mine, rests solely on the criminal minds ruining this blessed land of milk and honey.
While it is within the rights of anyone to fault the methods and timing of his many interventions including the most recent, #RevolutionNow, what is unacceptable is his traducers' penchant at distorting his motives and passion at seeing that this present order of blood and death is put to an end.
A country peopled by individuals who fail to appreciate little things will find it unworthy to reckon with the heavy sacrifices a few persons from amongst them make.
Whether the despotic government of Muhammadu Buhari frees Sowore or not, I have no doubt that individuals averse to the rot in this society will keep up with the momentum as a means to end this condition of suffering and sin firmly in place in Nigeria .
What is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that.
America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God's own country.
In cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.
Even though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a 'dump.'
The guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education.
Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.
It doesn't get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the 'C' average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything.
He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world.
Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today.
His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America's traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Donald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined.
He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.
The one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin.
He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years.
He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.
The Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to 'make America great again,' as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War.
Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.
Even though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.
My point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.
It is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.
If Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.
I seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up.
Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness.
Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud.
Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.
Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.
George Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his 'read my lips' pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.
I gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America.
Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.
Republicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America.
Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.
Republicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by 'grabbing their pussies' because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder.
He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan.
Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.
Republicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again.
Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.
Republicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.
They elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI.
Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman's mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.
Republicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin.
He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way.
Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders.
They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East.
Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.
The list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less.
Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as 'fake news' disseminators.
He has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.
What atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed?
The list is inexhaustible.
The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do.
Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.
It is a complete outrage and totally incredible!
I rest my case.

There's Still Time To Change, Group Tells Buhari
He also condemned the President on the handling of Omoyele Sowore's case, advising Buhari to take his government back from 'many unelected characters currently ruling the country by proxy'.
Voice of Reason, a group of Yoruba professionals, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to turn a new leaf from his current anti-democracy dispositions.
Chairman of the group, Olufemi Adegoke, said this during a press briefing on Thursday.
He also condemned the President on the handling of Omoyele Sowore's case, advising Buhari to take his government back from 'many unelected characters currently ruling the country by proxy'.
He said, 'As keen observers of the goings-on in the polity, we state without any equivocation that the President needs to act urgently not only to restore his integrity and align his lofty rhetoric with his actions but to regenerate in Nigerians faith that it is possible to have leaders that can serve all without discrimination.
'The 'born again democrat' garb lent to the President on the eve of 2015 election needs a lot of stitches to hang well on the wearer.
Democracy does not end with multi-party elections.
It includes fairness, transparency and integrity of the electoral process; absolute respect for the rule of law; protection of the independence of the institutions of democracy (parliament and the judiciary).
'We urge the President to borrow a leaf from General Gowon and do that which will strengthen the unity of Nigeria by leading the fight to restructure Nigeria, renew citizens' commitment to Nigeria, galvanise everybody's energy to build a nation where no one is oppressed,
show by example the need to reduce cost of governance, restore the rule of law, rededicate himself to defending democracy, protect all citizens' human rights and deepen the fight against corruption.
'President Buhari needs deep reflection and his genuine friends need to help him focus on leaving an enviable legacy.
It is not too late.
He has three years to go.
We pray for the sake of Nigeria and his place in history he takes our admonition in good faith and acts.'
They Have Started Again By Richard Akinnola
There are certain irreducible minimums l can tolerate from people I call my friends.
This is not about holding a contrary view but peddling falsehood to save face after such a despicable conduct of Friday.
Richard Akinnola
When Dele Giwa was assassinated on October 19, 1986, the major suspects were the two security operatives of the General Ibrahim Babangida junta.
In an attempt to shift the focus from them, they procured some Nigerians to peddle false narratives, accusing Dele's wife and his colleagues as the main suspects.
Also in 1986, Alozie Ogugbuaja, then the Lagos spokesperson for police, ran into troubled waters over his accusations against the military government for not funding the police.
He was suspended.
Thereafter, the agents of the junta went after his life.
A grenade was thrown from a moving vehicle at him but it refused to detonate.
Instead of standing by their man, the police IG, Gambo, said the grenade was 'harmless' and must have fallen from a moving vehicle.
Ever heard of a harmless grenade?
They always have odious lies to peddle.
In 1988, agents of Babangida junta set fire on Gani Fawehinmi's house at 28 Sabiu Ajose Crescent, Surulere, Lagos, housing his library and his second wife and her children.
Guess what the police said?
In an attempt to change the narrative of their dastardly action, they accused Gani Fawehinmi of setting his house on fire 'in order to embarrass the government'.
A livid Fawehinmi countered the police - 'You mean l would set fire on my house, housing my wife and children and books worth millions of naira just to embarrass a government that is already embarrassed? You must be insane like your useless government'.
In 1996, after the assassination of Alhaja Kudirat Abiola by the agents of Abacha junta, the security agencies, also in an attempt to shift the accusations from them, arrested some NADECO chieftains, accused them of being behind the gruesome act till a court ordered their release.
Of course, Nigerians knew that Abacha's Strike Force was behind the gruesome act.
Now, after the show of shame inside the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, the perpetrators have equally procured some people to retail some puerile and jejune narrative that it was Omoyele Sowore and his team that simulated the scene in order to blackmail the security agency.
Unfortunately, one of my friends, Mallam Jaji, is part of those peddling this narrative.
I have told him on his wall that with his position, l'm afraid of him.
I can't feel comfortable being friends with people like this.
In fact, l would have to unfriend him.
It's as serious as that.
We are not just Facebook friends, we are friends in real life.
But not anymore.
There are certain irreducible minimums I can tolerate from people l call my friends.
This is not about holding a contrary view but peddling falsehood to save face after such a despicable conduct of Friday.
You can go ahead to continue retailing your false narrative in order to mask an obvious fact but l also reserve the right to distance myself from such 'friends'.
I'm not emotional about severing relationship with such people.
As l often posit, this issue is not about Sowore as a person but about principle.
Thugs Shoot Two Children In Edo During Political Rally
The thugs shot sporadically into the air to scare away loyalists heading to Osagie Ize-Iyamu's house for the All Progressives Congress rally at Etete, GRA, Benin.
Two teenage boys in Edo State were hit by stray bullets on Friday morning as thugs invaded the city during a political rally.
The thugs shot sporadically into the air to scare away loyalists heading to Osagie Ize-Iyamu's house for the All Progressives Congress rally at Etete, GRA, Benin.
The two kids, Ovbiagele Ohimai and Joshua Samuel, who are seven and 11 respectively, were sent on an errand by their parents when they were hit by stray bullets.
They are receiving treatment in an undisclosed private hospital in Benin presently.
Many of Ize-Iyamu's loyalists, who were conveyed from the 18 local government areas of the state, sustained various degrees of bullet wounds as a result of the incident.
Tinubu All Smiles As Sanwo-Olu Receives Certificate Of Return
'Our resolve to lead the state as Governor and Deputy Governor is not about our personal welfare and that of our families, but a determination to build a state that all of us will be proud of,' Sanwo-Olu said.
'We will not disappoint Lagosians for the confidence reposed in us to lead on their behalf.
We promise to lead a government that will be responsible and that will work for the greater majority of residents.'
Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the most notable name in attendance as Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State Governor-Elect, and his running mate Obafemi Hamzat received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at a ceremony held at the commission's office in Yaba, Lagos Mainland, on Friday.
Clad in Agbada with caps to match, the Governor-elect and his deputy were accompanied to the carnival-like event by their wives, associates, family members and APC leaders, including the party chairman in Lagos, Hon. Tunde Balogun; party leader, Prince Tajudeen Olusi; and former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, among others.
At exactly 11:30am, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun states, Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, presented the certificate to Sanwo-Olu, charging the Governor-Elect to be magnanimous in victory.
Sanwo-Olu received the certificate in company of his wife, Ibijoke.
Ogunmola charged Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat to pursue reconciliation and close ranks with their opponents, reminding them that tolerance of opposition remains a key foundation of constitutional democracy.
The state's Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Sam Olumekun, described Sanwo-Olu's victory as rancour-free, noting that international observers adjudged the Lagos governorship election to be free, fair and credible.
Pointing out that 45 political parties fielded governorship candidates in the election, Olumekun, however, lamented apathy among voters in some constituencies.
He particularly made a reference to Eti-Osa Constituency 1, which recorded a four per cent voter turnout ‚Äî a development he described as unprecedented.
In his six-minute acceptance speech, Sanwo-Olu promised to lead 'an all-inclusive government', while extending a hand of fellowship to his opponents in the governorship race.
He expressed joy that his victory was not tainted by violence and bloodshed.
He specially paid tribute to President Muhammadu Buhari and Tinubu for displaying 'responsible leadership', which 'led to victory of APC in Lagos and the centre'.
He said: 'Our resolve to lead the state as Governor and Deputy Governor is not about our personal welfare and that of our families, but a determination to build a state that all of us will be proud of.
We will not disappoint Lagosians for the confidence reposed in us to lead on their behalf.
We promise to lead a government that will be responsible and that will work for the greater majority of residents.
'Whatever happened during the campaign period belongs to the past.
It's time for reconciliation and the state must move forward.
Therefore, we will not engage anyone or group based on their political affiliation, ethnic nationality or whether they voted for us or not, we are all Lagosians and we will run a government that will work for all.'

Trader Sues Saraki, Atiku For Portraying Her In Campaign Poster
She said her picture was taken without her consent and put to pubic use where she was portrayed like she was deprived and less privileged.
Amuda Adeleke, a trader in Victoria Island, Lagos, has sued Bukola Saraki, a former Senate President, who was also Director-General of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation for the 2019 general election, for portraying her in a poster as poor.
Adeleke also joined in the suit Abukabar, his running mate, Peter Obi and the Peoples Democratic Party.
She said her picture was taken without her consent and put to pubic use where she was portrayed like she was deprived and less privileged.
The suit, which was filed before the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, is praying the court to award N45m damages to the plaintiff for the unauthorised and unlawful use of her photographs.
She explained through the court papers that Saraki and his campaign crew had come to Victoria Island during the election to canvass for votes, adding that she was not aware that the photographs taken would become a part of PDP's campaign souvenir
She said she was shocked when she started receiving phone calls from relatives and friends, who had seen the campaign billboards on which her photo was displayed.
However, Saraki and the other respondent denied that they had any contact with the woman.
The respondents argued that their campaign materials were managed by a third party, and that the company sought her consent and interviewed her before using her pictures.
The respondents said she had given her name as Tope Olukolu.
They also claimed she was paid before her photographs were used.
The court has now adjourned the case to January 2020 for the continuation of hearing.

According to a witness, the tragic incident occurred very early on Tuesday along a rail line behind Kano Club in Nasarawa Local Government area of the city.
The witness also said the victims of the accident were lying down on the rail trail and oblivious of the approaching train until it crushed them.

'The Police's visit showed that one of the victims was cut into two parts. The bodies have been evacuated to the hospital.'
Trump's Trial Or Triumph? By Hannatu Musawa
The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump's alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.
President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington. The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.
Hannatu Musawa
A near impossible and rare feat is to impeach a United States' president.
The president must have committed, either bribery, treason or other serious crimes or misdemeanors.
Even at that, in the present clime, it is almost impossible to believe that the Republican members of Congress in the Senate would pass such a bill if presented with one by the lower House of Representatives.
After the American civil war and President Abraham Lincoln's death, his Vice President, Andrew Johnson became the 17th president of the US, Johnson, had radical ideas and constantly was at loggerheads with the Congress by vetoing certain bills.
In 1867 when he replaced the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, a man appointed by Lincoln who supported the Radical Republicans, a breakaway group of the party who believed in the civil rights of freed African Americans, Congress pushed hard and presented eleven articles of impeachment alleging that President Johnson had violated what is known as the 'Tenure of Office Act', that is, a law meant to limit presidential power to remove federal appointees from office without consulting the Senate.
Eventually, in 1868, President Johnson was successfully impeached by a two- thirds majority of the House. This act was deemed unconstitutional years later by the Supreme Court.
President Johnson was not removed from office because a single vote from seven Republicans who voted with the Democrats saved his position.
A Historian, Hans L. Trefousse wrote, 'The weakness of the case convinced many that the charges were largely political and that the violation of the Tenure of Office Act constituted neither a crime nor a violation of the Constitution but merely a pretext for Johnson's opponents.'
Interestingly, this historic case set the tone in Washington for future Presidential impeachments to follow, namely that no President should ever be impeached for political reasons but should be impeached for 'treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors' as clearly stated by the U.S. Constitution.
Using the same paintbrush of which hunting for political reasons, the White House has repeatedly dismissed claims by the Democrats that top government officials had pressured leaders of other nations, namely Ukraine, to investigate the former U.S. Vice President and 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the personal and political interest of President Trump.
President Trump has been quoted publicly as bragging that the Democrats have 'no grounds to impeach.'
He claims he has done 'nothing wrong or illegal' in light of the formal impeachment proceedings against him recently.
In 1972, when the Watergate scandal broke, the 37th president of the US, Richard, Nixon struggled to cover up his direct involvement in the burgling and trespassing of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington.
The scandal was intertwined with multiple cases of abuse of power of officials of the Nixon administration, which culminated in the commencement of an impeachment process against him.
Apart from the overwhelming evidence of cash found on the five burglars of the DNC headquarters leading back to Nixon's Staff, the investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape recording system in his offices where private conversations were recorded.
After grueling court battles, the Supreme Court ruled that the President was obligated to release the infamous tapes to government investigators.
The tapes bore damning evidence that President Nixon was irrefutably involved in the break-in of the DNC office and abuse of power to cover up the investigation.
In light of a predictable impeachment, on 9 August 1974, Nixon resigned his turbulent presidency.
'Watergate' the name became synonymous with political or public scandal not just in the United States but globally as well.
On October 8, 1998, the United States House of Representatives commenced impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the U.S. under the accusation of 'high crimes and misdemeanors'.
The reasons were for lying under oath and obstruction of justice tied to the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by a woman named Paula Jones.
This would be the second time an American president would be impeached where the House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate for adjudication.
I remember vividly the frenzy by paparazzi when the proceedings of impeachment began in January 1999 with the Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding.
After sensational interviews and depositions, President Bill Clinton was acquitted on February 12, 1999, on both counts of high crimes and misdemeanors as neither charges received the necessary two- thirds majority vote of the Senators present for conviction and removal from office.
President Bill Clinton remained in office for the rest of his second term.
Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton despite pre-election nationwide polls that predicted she would win.
Globally women had been excited as her victory would have been a symbol of gender equality with a female being the leader of the free world, the great United States of America, land of dreams.
It was a bitter defeat for billions all over the world.
Almost immediately, President Trump's presidency was riddled in controversies, accusations, and scandals amidst a chaotic White House.
One could say that ultimately Hillary Clinton may have had the last laugh after all.
The White House Staff were either dismissed or they quit by themselves and replaced on a regular basis, even the press struggled to keep up with the changes.
A massive scandal subsequently broke out alleging that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election and the President took great pains to undermine the investigation.
It posed a threat to national security and made a mockery of the American voting system.
The Russia scandal, the firing of James Comey (former FBI Director), resignation of Michael Flynn (former national adviser) and many more obstacles in his administration proved this to be the most troubled presidency in modern history.
All this was happening amidst a barrage of regular tweets from the President on his official account on social media, which most see as unbecoming and entirely inappropriate for a President in office.
The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump's alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.
President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington.
The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.
In the middle of September 2019, Trump's misuse of power to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign came into the full glare of the public because of a whistleblower statement made in August 2019.
Then on 24 September 2019, the House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry led by six House Committees and the House voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry on 31 October 2019.
To impeach President Trump, a majority is required in the House and for conviction or removal from office a two- thirds 'super majority' is required in the senate.
The whole world waits and watches the outcome of the impeachment as they also wonder whether President Trump who could so aptly be described as the cat with nine lives (having emerged seemingly unscathed by each scandal) would survive the latest misconduct.
The question remains: Will this be Trump's triumph or trial? We only have a short while left to see as the political games in the United States continue to unravel.

In reaction to the news circulating about the suspension of operations of Turkish Airlines in Nigeria by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, the airline has denied the report, branding it as false and misleading.
Turkish Airlines in a statement sent to SaharaReporters, said it continues to operate in all of its destinations in Nigeria, adding that the news was far from reality.
The airline said, 'There are reports circulating in several news websites that claim Turkish Airlines operations in Nigeria are suspended or to be suspended by Nigeria Civil Aviation

Turkish Airlines Deploys Bigger Aircraft To Nigerian Route After Passengers' Protest NCAA had threatened to sack the airline from Nigeria if it continued to delay passengers' check-in luggage on arrival at Lagos and Abuja airports.
Turkish Airlines has succumbed to threats by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority of being kicked out of the country by deploying bigger aircraft to Lagos and Abuja.
NCAA had threatened to sack the airline from Nigeria if it continued to delay passengers' check-in luggage on arrival at Lagos and Abuja airports.
The airline has deployed a bigger aircraft, an Airbus 330 to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, rather than the previous Boeing 737 it used for the route.
The use of the B737, which is a smaller aircraft with a maximum capacity of 150 passengers, caused hardship to passengers whose luggage were consistently left behind in Istanbul, Turkey by the airline.
This forced some passengers to protest the non-arrival of their check-in luggage.
Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, confirmed the news on his official Twitter page.
He said, 'Turkish Air operated A330 to Abuja today as against the small B737 in apparent response to our suspension order.
We needed not to get to this,' Turkish Airlines is allegedly notorious for its poor treatment of Nigerian travellers especially when they have to arrive their destinations without their checked-in luggage.

Victor Uwaifo: Why I Sued Simi For N50 Million Damages
Uwaifo accused the songstress of 'stealing' his intellectual property, 'Joromi'.
Victor Uwaifo and Simi
Legendary Nigerian singer and guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, has revealed why he sued Nigerian singer, Simisola Bolatito Ogunleye, aka Simi, for N50 million.
Uwaifo accused the songstress of 'stealing' his intellectual property, 'Joromi'.
In an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters shortly after his performance at the just concluded National Festival of Arts and Culture in Edo State, he said: 'We're in court already.
I sued her at the federal high court for N50 million.
They will be coming to court.'
When Sahara Reporters asked if Simi had reached out to him privately, he answered: 'No, only through her lawyers.
We will meet in court.'
Over a year ago, Uwaifo had told SaharaReporters that Simi was in trouble for failing credit for the song, Joromi, which she remixed.
He had said, when asked if he was going to take any legal action against Simi, 'One after the other.
I cannot just take everybody to court at the same time.
I don't know whether he or she; I know she is but I know somebody is behind it.
An LP was sent as a compliment; I'm still looking at it but they were planning to come to Benin to see me.
Up till now, they haven't come.
So I'm just putting that one on hold.
'Joromi' is a franchise.
The name never existed before.
Benin don't have 'J' in their language.
If any started with 'J' in Benin then it is fake.
All consonant words start with vowel sounds.
For example, if I use the trademark of one of these soft drinks, it is wrong.
So Simi is in trouble.'
Walter's Wake-keep By Rudolf Ogoo Okonkwo
Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game.
Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake.
Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria.
In the Boston metropolitan area is a Liberian who loved to attend Nigerian parties.
(Let us call him Walter, because we have no permission to use his real name.)
He loved Nigerian music, jollof rice, pepper soup, Shoki dance and watching Nigerians spray dollar bills like snow flakes at these parties.
Trust Nigerians in America, they come up with every reason to throw a party - child dedication, wedding anniversary, birthday, graduation, send-off, wake-keep, etc.
Every party is special but none is as special as a wake-keep.
If you rent a hall to celebrate your 50th birthday or 25th wedding anniversary, or even your child's 5th birthday, or your child's dedication in church, the general feeling is that you have the money to spare.
People will still come, enjoy, and may even give you gifts, but it is mostly not seen as obligatory.
But when it is a wake-keep, the party from conception to execution is aimed at raising money to assist the bereaved to go home and attend the funeral of the dead.
The MC makes that clear every ten minutes of the event.
And since people are expected to drop something,' organizers make sure that there are a lot of food and drinks to justify the things people will 'drop'.
Another feature of these wake-keep, other than the fact that most of those for whom the events are held had never been to America, is that there is an unwritten understanding between the organizers and the attendees that whatever the attendee gives is documented, noted and permanently preserved for the time when it would be necessary to return the favor.
In Igbo community, they even have a proverb that backs it up.
It says: whatever a man gives to another man is a loan waiting to be repaid.
This last part accounts for the proliferation of wake-keep.
It is like a form of isusu.
You wait for your turn to collect return on your investments.
Those who had lost their parents before coming to America waste no time in holding wakes for their uncles and aunts, not minding whether they were close or not.
Some will roll out the wake-keep red carpet for their step-mothers and step-fathers, even if they never saw eye-to-eye in life.
All that they needed to say was that their parents died when they were young and it was this uncle, this aunt, this step-father, this step-mother, even step-sister and step-brother that stepped in and raised them.
Who are you to argue with a grieving fellow?
After all, the ever-increasing cost of burial at home means that no matter who dies, once the 3 am call comes, the demand for money follows.
And having someone abroad means pressure to go for 'a befitting' oversea-higher-standard burial.
Wake-keep is so ubiquitous that people now simplify it by saying Peter's wake or Angela's wake, instead of properly labeling it as the wake of Peter's father or Angela's mother.
It saves everyone the headache of figuring out the real relationship.
Once you are part of the wake-keep-going circus, it is expected that, sooner or later, you will get your own wake.
One guy having difficulty completing his house in the village manufactured his own wake out of the death of his maternal grandmother.
Recently, the expectation of going home for the funeral has been waived.
It is now acceptable that the person who collected all those money at the wake did not even go home for the funeral.
That he or she presumably sent the money home is satisfactory.
Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game.
Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake.
Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria.
Though recently there has been the increasing grumble for Nigerian-Americans to obtain life insurance to cover transportation of their body home, if they so wish, and still leave something for those they left behind.
Walter is a permanent fixture at these wakes.
He drinks to his heart's desire, dances until his waist aches.
He once inquired about joining People's Club after he watched the display of the club members at some of these wakes, but he pulled back when told how much it costs to join the club.
Then, one day, Walter's mother died.
And Walter had his wake.
He contacted his Nigerian friends who told him how to plan a wake.
He did not have close friends to constitute his Committee of Friends so he became his own one-man Committee of Friends.
He did all the running-around and spent all the money needed for drinks, hall, DJ, photographer and food.
On the day of the wake, Nigerians came in large numbers.
They ate, drank, danced, and, went home.
The morning after Walter's wake, he went to the office of a friend of mine who had given him $50.
The average money given at these wakes is $100.
Walter thanked my friend so profusely that my friend found it odd.
Something a phone call would have taken care of, Walter came in person.
When Walter left, my friend called around to find out why Walter was super appreciative.
Could it be because someone who didn't know him very well gave him $50?
What my friend found out was that all those Nigerians who came, ate, drank, danced, and then went home, none gave Walter any money because he never gave any money at all those wakes he had attended over the years.

We Have Always Maintained Our Innocence, Says NFF President, Pinnick
On the recent court victory, Pinnick said, 'This is not a personal victory for me and my other board members.
It is victory for all of Nigerian football.'
President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has said that his team had always maintained their innocence at the organisation.
Pinnick made the disclosure on Monday while appearing as guest on Channels Television's Sunrise Daily.
The NFF President said his team had also always laid its books bare for everyone to see.
His statement comes few days after a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja discharged and acquitted him of charges bordering on fraud to the tune of $8.4m and N4bn.
Pinnick and other executives of the NFF were charged on 16 counts of corruption and misappropriation of the said sums from the 2014 FIFA Grant, as well as for conflict of interest and non-declaration of assets by the defunct Special Presidential Investigation Panel headed by Okon Obono-Obla.
He said that Gov. Willie Obiano was interested in Agriculture, especially livestock production, calling on such farmers to utilise the opportunity made available in the state.
The officer urged farmers to work closely with Agric Ministry to benefit from governor's incentive packages aimed at boosting animal production.'
Mr Okeke gave tips on how pig farm could be constructed as well as promised to produce manuals for achieving odourless pig farming.
He enjoined pig farmers to go to the grassroots to convince other farmers to join them to access government facilities in order to develop their farms.

Experts want critical thinkers to lead, transform Nigeria.
Stakeholders who converged on the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU) Awka, Anambra State have canvassed the emergence of critical thinkers in leadership positions with a view to transforming Nigeria.
They stated this during the Ninth World Philosophy Day of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, with the theme, 'Critical Thinking, Leadership and Social Transformation.
A former Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Rev. Fr. Professor Obi Oguejiofor noted that leaders are drawn to the led if they possess critical thinking, analytical, communicative, creative, open-minded and problem solving to lead and transform organisations or institutions socially and economically.
He lamented that the problems dogging Nigeria and Africa's developmental path stem from absence of leaders who could think critically from time to time, likening the failure of Nigerians to think critically in the clamour for power shift, which he said, does not produce the best leader who could give justice.
Also, former Chair, Department of English and Speech, A & T State University, North Carolina, United States of America, Professor Chimalu Nwankwo lamented that Africans do not think critically hence their inability to think on their own, but rely on dictates of foreigners.
Another stakeholder, Professor A. U. Igwe wondered if Nigerians apply critical thinking in whatever they do just as he condemned leaders who choose to become egocentric rather than critical thinkers when occupy leadership positions.
Igwe, who is a Professor of History, at NAU, said there were few African leaders who were guided by critical thinking, particularly the former President of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara who he described as an ideal leader who employed critical thinking and rational application of force during his regime.
He observed that the UNESCO knows the important role philosophy plays in leadership; hence the declaration of November 21 every year as World Philosophy Day, stressing that critical thinking propels leaders to better the lot of their people.
On his part, Dr. Emmanuel Umezinwa of the Department of Music and the first Master Degree Graduate of Philosophy Department, said Western system of thinking has inadvertently made Africans to sharpen their intellect and give too much thought to thinking, adding that there is an 'overblown idea of thought.
Government should enforce ban on religious activities in stadia ‚Äï Rojenny Proprietor.
Rommy Ezeonwuka, Proprietor of Rojenny Stadium and Tourists Village, has called on government at all levels to ban religious and other non-sporting activities in all spots sports stadia in the country.
Ezeonwuka made the call when he received members of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Anambra chapter, who were on tour of sports facilities in the state.
The tour of sports was part of the three day SWAN Week activities in the state.
The facility investor blamed the collapse of most Nigerian stadia on their use for non-sporting activities like religious crusades and political rallies.
He berated successive sports administrators in the country for misuse of the multi-billion Naira facilities for momentary gain.

Ezeonwuka said Rojenny was still relevant more than three decades because he refused to allow such distractions in his facility.
'One major factor that is killing our sports facility is the permission to use them for activities that are not sports related, it is sad that government allows crusade, political rallies, burials in our stadia.
'Look at the National Stadium in Surulere, National Stadium Abuja and other facilities that should be used for training our youths for world championships collapsing because our administrators rent them out for money.
'Even here in Anambra, Achebe Stadium, Fegge and Ikpeazu Stadium have collapsed because of these things, it should be stopped and government should outlaw it.
'Sports has a spirit and you must respect the spirit of sports, that is why I have refused to allow anybody to use here for any other thing other than sports, that is the secret of Rojenny survival after 35 years.
'This is the only individually-owned Olympic size Stadium where you can hold most major games without leaving the stadium complex,' he said.
Ezeonwuka said Nigeria had all it takes to dominate sports at the world stage but regretted that administrators have reduced the country to mere training ground where other countries come to adopt talented athletes.
He said Nigeria must try to retain their best so that the country could enjoy the benefits of sporting economy like Europe, America and now, Asia.
On the coming Nigeria Police Games scheduled to hold at Rojenny next year, Ezeonwuka described Rojenny as the proverbial parish waiting for the priest to come and conduct the Holy Mass.
'Bahrain adopted about 10 Nigerians athletes, the young girls that recently won the world championship for them trained here, we must stop the West from poaching on us by placing value on what we have.
'Rojenny is like a parish waiting for the priest, the priest is the government who is supposed to create programmes so that athletes can make use of what we have here.
'It is not easy to run a stadium, even the government is finding it difficult, so those of us in the private sector need encouragement.
'I want to thank the Nigerian Police for finding here worthy and we promise that the 2020 Games will be the best for them,' he said.
In his remark, Philip Balepo, a veteran journalist, said Rojenny deserved a golden place in the history of Nigerian sports because of what he had done for the Nigerian youth.
Balepo, who expressed satisfaction with the ambience of Rojenny environment, called on Nigerian sports administrators to visit the place and see how best it could be optimised for sports growth.
The SWAN team was led by its chairman Anthony Oji.

Kalu's conviction: Joining ruling party not guarantee against criminal justice ‚Äï Nwagwu.
Orji Kalu.
Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chairman , Partners for Electoral Reforms (PEF) says the jailing of former Gov. Orji Kalu of Abia was a proof that joining the ruling party with criminal case was not a guarantee against justice.
Nwagwu in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja said that the jailing has faulted the notion that once people with criminal record join the ruling party they were covered.
NAN reports that Kalu was on Thursday convicted of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Federal High Court in Lagos after he was found guilty of N7.2 billion fraud and money laundering.
The judgment is a good boost for the anti-corruption fight, especially against the background of all the noise about once somebody is in the All Progressives Congress (APC) the person cannot be brought to justice.

'It also signals the fact that no matter how long it last, once there is the determination by the court to bring justice, justice would be done.
' We are excited about the judgment and we hope that it is also brought to bear on the Babachir Lawal's case and other cases of people with a criminal record who think that being in the ruling party is a guarantee against justice,' he said.

Nigeria may miss SDG on healthcare, says Soludo.
Former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof.
Chukwuma Soludo, has said that if the Federal Government does not initiate good reforms, the country may miss out on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthcare.
Soludo spoke at the 26th Annual Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Development Forum themed 'The Nigerian Healthcare Situation: The Way Forward' in Abuja.
According to him, tackling healthcare challenges in the country requires decisive and comprehensive war on poverty, inequality, illiteracy or poor public health education, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as provision of adequate and accessible public health facilities and insurance schemes.
'The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.
'There are about 13 specific targets to meet.
From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,' he said.
Government's expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the 'other hand' (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the 'progressive decline' of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
He noted that the country's healthcare statistics was as scary as its poverty and unemployment statistics, using the average life expectancy as summary indicator.
The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.
He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.
In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr.
Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.
He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.
In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country's health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.

Residents flee town of Kanu's lawyer after policemen's death.
A siege allegedly laid to Oraifite in Ekwusigo Local Government of Anambra State by a combined team of soldiers and policemen forced residents to flee the community yesterday.
The desertion of the community came on the heels of declaration of Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the Supreme Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, wanted by the state police command over an alleged killing of Oliver Innoma Abbey, the Oraifite Area Commander and the SARS Commander, Ichi Sector, Patrick Agbazue.
The two officers led a police patrol team to the compound of Ejiofor in Oraifite, where the police allegedly shot at three persons and wounded scores of others suspected to belong to IPOB.
It was learnt that the seeming police invasion of the house of the counsel to Kanu, who had three days earlier buried one of his elder brothers, irked some youths in the area who allegedly launched a reprisal attack, which is believed to have resulted in the death of Abbey and Agbazue whose remains were burnt and buried near a village market.
The police and IPOB have given differing accounts of the incident in which not less than 20 houses and shops have been razed.
Revving critical national issues as Madueke launches autography.
Admiral Allison MaduekeNo doubt, the story of the 30-month Nigerian Civil War of 1967 would remain a critical point for discussion anytime Nigeria is being examined in history to project for a better future.
So also the agitation for restructuring and June 12, 1993, presidential election, acclaimed to have been won by the late business mogul, Chief M.K.O. Abiola but annulled by the then military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.
These issues seem recurring and cannot be overlooked as they impact on national discourse.
Twenty-one years since Nigeria returned to civil rule, those factors that led to the civil war, the unending agitations for restructuring and the perceived domination of governance system by a particular section of the country are still visible markers that still haunt the country and continue to stifle its development.
As a matter of fact, most of the issues have not been adequately tackled many leas put in proper perspectives in a manner that could have helped in reshaping the nation's growth and development.
These factors were part of issues that were publicly deliberated upon, when former Chief of Naval Staff and one-time Military Administrator of Anambra and the Imo State, Admiral Allison Madueke (rtd), launched his autobiography last week.
It is entitled Riding the Storms, with God in My Sails at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos.
Seeking inclusiveness through regional development commissions.
Oduah.
The quest for the establishment of development commissions for the remaining geo-political zones in the country apart from the South-south and Northeast gained momentum recently with the introduction of three bills to that effect in the Senate.
ONYEDIKA AGBEDO looks at the genesis of the move, the gimmicks around it and its likely outcome in this report.
There is a cool 'war' in the Senate among the geo-political zones in the country following penultimate Wednesday's reintroduction of a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission.
The 8th Senate had passed the bill, sponsored by Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North) on December 12, 2018, but it did not get President Muhammadu Buhari's assent.
Should the bill secure the nod of the lawmakers again and possibly receive presidential assent this time around, it would give birth to a commission charged with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds specially allocated by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reparation for lost houses and businesses of victims of the Nigerian civil war.
The commission would also address any other environmental or developmental challenges confronting the zone.
Clause 15 (2a) of the bill, which identifies source of funding for the commission, stipulates that the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total monthly statutory allocation due to the member states of the commission shall be from the Federation Account.
Willie Obiano for pursuing and actualising this vision with zeal and zest and I thank him for supporting the committee all through the work.
Dr Okpala explained that the centre was operating under the direction of the National Coordination Centre and everything was under control.
Dr Ikpeazu added that the benefits of having a Division of the court the state had been enormous because besides saving lawyers and litigants from Anambra State the stress and risk of travelling to Enugu, the appellate court has essentially brought justice closer to the people.
It is a boost to our judicial system.
It will assist the litigants, the lawyers and all who want justice.
Remember we have only one Court of Appeal as others are Divisions.
He emphasised the need for Ndi Anambra to be aware of the basic measures to take to protect themselves in their homes, schools, markets and Churches.
Chief Emeka Etiaba, SAN, said: with the establishment of the Court of Appeal, 60 per cent of cases in Enugu are from Anambra and will be transferred to Awka.
It will bring in development in the state and improve the state's Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), through payment of their taxes.
Another form of development it would bring would be granting employment opportunities to Ndi Anambra.
According to him, the junior cadre workers like cleaners, messengers and other personnel will be employed from the state.
Another lawyer, Mr Nnamdi Ibegbu, SAN, said: I am delighted to that court has finally arrived here in Awka.
After many years of hardwork, I participated actively in the exercise.
I even represented the President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr Paul Usoro, SAN, and read his address.
Hon Justice C.E Nwosu-Iheme JCA has been named as the Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Awka Division.

We assure you that those yet to receive their salaries after the verification exercise will receive theirs with February payment.
Also, Approval has been obtained for 2018 promotion.
Dr Okpala emphasised their preparedness to respond to any outbreak of the fever in the state, investigating rumours of outbreaks.
Adigwe also said that NULGE Day celebration would commence this 2020, saying that it would feature memorial lectures, award presentation, and free healthcare.
He added that proceeds from the exercise would be used to build worker's canteen.
The president informed those affected in over deduction by Star Times Company should be patient as measures had been taken to obtain their refunds.
Idemili LG NULGE Chairman, Mrs Juliana Anyanwu thanked the new executive committee for making out time to come and feel their pulse.
She assured them of their support.
The committee later paid curtsey visit to the Idemili LGA Chairman, Mr Don Unachukwu, who congratulated them over their victory, promising to cooperate with workers.

She said that the cave/waterfalls site had a structure and accessible road built by Gov. Willie Obiano and was commissioned in 2018 to promote tourism and attract investors.

Acting Chief Judge of Anambra State, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu who made the commendation during the inauguration of 18th Division of the Appeal Court, observed that Gov. Obiano had never interfered in the activities of judiciary since inception of office.
The chief judge, who also extolled the governor for unparalleled commitment toward achieving the location of a Division of the appeal court in Awka, said it would facilitate faster dispensation of justice.
One thing I must say about the person of the governor of Anambra State is that, he is a profound respecter of the rule of law and deeply cherishes separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary.
He had never interfered in the manner judges and magistrates in Anambra discharge their judicial duties.
I have no doubt that Gov. Obiano, in his characteristic nature of motivating, mobilising, and encouraging human capital development of the workforce of Anambra.
I am certain that he will extend the same to judges and staff members of the Court of Appeal, Awka Division, as they work here and enjoy the warm hospitality of Ndi Anambra, Anyachebelu said.
He said that the governor would further upgrade other necessary facilities to meet judicial standards.
While addressing newsmen in her office in Awka, the commissioner noted that the structure at the cave/waterfalls served multiple purposes.

HEALTH MINISTRY PARTNERS CARTER CENTRE TO ELIMINATE NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
Ford Foundation in collaboration with a group of experts and some industrialists have concluded plans to organise Nnewi Investment Summit.
The summit with theme: Revitalising The Manufacturing Hub of Africa, has been designed to leverage on the already thriving industrial and commercial activities in Nnewi in order to harness them for wider economic development of Nigeria.
Those expected to lead the conversations at the inaugural edition of the summit, to hold on Feb .
Anambra State Ministry of Health is partnering Carter Centre to eliminate Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) in the state.
Speaking on the summit, CEO, TBWA/Concept Unit, Mr Kelechi Nwosu, said the Nnewi industrial hub should further be developed and promoted as model for economic growth in Anambra and Nigeria in general.
Nwosu notes: Nnewi is a unique town, where young entrepreneurs and courageous artisans with limited formal education exploit their wit to create amazing stories of manufacturing and industrialisation in Nigeria.

18TH DIVISION OF COURT OF APPEAL INAUGURATED IN AWKA By John Ndu
The commissioner praised Gov. Obiano for granting approval to the ministry to upgrade the facility and to organise the 2019 Homecoming Festival, held between last December and January.
She noted that investors were needed to help in furnishing the bar and the tourism information desk.
Mbanefo said that plans were on the way to commission Ogbunike cave in 2020.
A new Court of Appeal Division, the 18th in the series has been inaugurated in Awka, the Anambra State capital.
The milestone achievement is coming after 29 years of the state's to provide easy and timely access to justice for people of Anambra and environs.
Inaugurating the new Appeal Court Complex at Court Road, Awka, Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra said it was consistent with his administration's efforts to give the Judiciary a pride of place in the state and to bring justice closer to Ndi Anambra.'
The Governor noted that the establishment of the court would reduce risks faced by lawyers and litigants, who had been to travel to and fro Enugu in search of justice.
According to him 70 per cent of the cases at the court in Enugu emanated from Anambra, stressing that the cases will now be transferred to Anambra State for easy dispensation of justice.
The importance of this day can easily be seen in the imperatives of justice to a society that desires growth, freedom and democracy.
Indeed, no progressive society can experience rapid growth without the stabilising presence of robust institutions of which the Judiciary is one.
Therefore, as our beloved state expands to accommodate the growth in our democratic culture, in the economy and in social life generally, it becomes important that we establish the organs that will help to keep the society on its toes, Gov. Obiano stressed.
President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa earlier said the Nigerian Judiciary acknowledged the enormous need to bring justice closer to the people, hence the continued creation of more divisions to ensure faster justice delivery.
She commended the determination of Gov. Willie Obiano in making the project a reality.
Acting Chief Judge of Anambra State, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu maintained that the establishment of the court Anambra State would bring relief to teeming litigants in Anambra State and their counsels.
Anyachebelu noted that prior to this date, people travel to Enugu to have their appeals heard.
According to Anyachebelu, going by statistics the cases and the guiding principles of bringing Justice nearer to the people, I think Anambra state deserves a division of the court of Appeal.
I am aware that the honourable president of the Court of Appeal has posted a panel of three distinguished Nobel Lords of the Court of Appeal' to kick-start the onerous judicial work in the Awka Division.
It is good for a start, but I know that based on volume of cases waiting for attention of the Awka division, two panels of five justices are needed to truly deal with the work of the Court of Appeal in Anambra State.
TC ONITSHA NORTH URGES YOUTHS TO BE CONSCIOUS OF POLITICAL RIGHTS By John Ndu
Transition Committee Chairman, Onitsha North Local Government Area (LGA), Mr Patrick Agha-Mba, has urged Nigerian youths to live up to societal expectations and acting within the purview of their political rights.

Our leaders should invest in youths so as to groom them for tomorrow's positions.
In Anambra, Gov. Obiano has demonstrated his love for youths; about 70 per cent of his appointees are youths.
This is totally different from what we see in other states.
With Obiano's policy on youth political involvement, Anambra youths have been emancipated from political slavery and thuggery.
Youths now decide what they want for the good of the state.
The example is seen at the just-concluded National Convention of youths in the state, he said.
Agha-Mba noted that the convention was organised by the United Anambra Youths Assembly, sponsored by their president, Mr Chinedu Obidigwe, who also represents Anambra East and West at the National Assembly.

State Monitor, Anambra Government Business Tax Office (AGBTO), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Awka, Mr Ikpo Okereke, said that the campaign was a tripartite collaboration between the chartered Institute of taxation of Nigeria (CITN), FIRS and AIRS.
So, we are trying to sensitise Anambra people on the need to pay their taxes.'
The Nigeria Institute of Soil Science (NISS) has said it is ready to clampdown on unqualified and fake soil scientists in the country.
The institute said it had reached an advanced stage towards the planned prosecution of unqualified soil scientists.
The Registrar, NISS, Professor Victor Chude, who made this known in Abuja at the induction ceremony of newly registered soil scientists, said the move became necessary following high level of quackery among soil scientists in the country.
Chude said the induction of the newly registered soil scientists was to establish the culture of standards.
He said the NISS Act 2017 is to regulate the profession of soil science, the use and management of soil resources to maintain high soil quality for sustainable crop production.
According to him, soil scientists play the same role as doctors do, and if the soil is not properly treated, it will not support the production of crops and it will not allow it produce good yield.
'With the induction of the soil scientists, there is going to be awareness created for people to know how we operate.
We are going to have an amendment to the Act as soil is a vital and non-renewable component of the ecosystem,' he said.
However, President of NISS and chairman of the Council, Professor Ayo Ogunkunle, said the negative impact of charlatans among soil scientists could affect millions of people for several years before detection.
Prof Ogunkunle, who noted that the importance of the regulation of the standards qualification and skills of soil scientists could not be over-emphasised, said the soil resources of the nation must not be neglected or allowed to degrade.
While noting that the detailed survey and mapping of Nigeria's soil resources are overdue, he the solicited support from the government in view of its importance.
He said: 'Agricultural soil is the real wealth of a nation as it is basic to human existence, essential for food, feeds, fibres and fuel production.
'A crucial requirement for appropriate use and management of the soil resources of a nation is a good knowledge of the various soil components and characteristics.
This is not possible without a detailed soil survey of the country,' he said.
Mr Okereke said that his office was in charge of collecting value added and withholding taxes from all government agencies in Anambra State.
Photo; PIXABAYThe Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) has said that it has commenced talks with filling plant owners and other relevant stakeholders in order to commence the re-qualification of used gas cylinders.
A statement signed by the Deputy Director and Head, Taxpayer Education and Enlightenment Team (TEET), Mrs Sylvia Tochukwu-Ngige, said that the campaign would hold from March 2 to March 7.
The theme for the Tax Week which is: Voluntary Compliance to Tax Payment', is geared toward sensitising Ndi Anambra on the whole processes of taxation.
However, the agency stated that the exercise would appear daunting in view of individual ownership of liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) cylinder in the country.
Director, Inspectorate and Compliance Directorate, SON, Obiora Manafa, stated that plans are underway to work with stakeholders in the industry to begin a requalification scheme which would put every used cylinder through a requalification exercise to ensure that a cylinder is not used beyond its expiration date.
Identifying some of the challenges likely to be faced by the programme, especially in relation to the replacement of cylinders after withdrawal, he stated that in a country where gas cylinders are owned by individuals, it would be difficult to carry out the scheme as its being done in other countries where cylinders are owned by marketers.
'In Nigeria, cylinders are owned by individuals but owned by marketers in other climes and once the cylinders are due for recertification, it is easy for withdrawal, but difficult to get these cylinders from individuals to do requalification.
'The only way it can work is if any consumer takes a cylinder to a filling plant to refill and the plant owner checks the cylinder and it is due for requalification, the plant owners should be given powers to seize the cylinder.
These are some of the things we are working with other stakeholders in the industry to address,' he said.
Manafa added that the life span of a cylinder is 15 years and when using a brand new cylinder, users have to calculate another 15 years for the usage.
'However, unscrupulous importers go outside the country to bring in these cylinders that have been discarded and have been used for over 30 years.
These cylinders are not allowed in the Nigerian market because they are dead on arrival and they are not safe for anybody to use, they are expired and weak', he said.
He advised importers and consumers to always seek advice from SON before purchasing these cylinders while recommending the usage of brand new cylinders certified by SON.
He further urged importers to stick to the specification of the standards, warning that going out of the standards would only see their products seized and destroyed.
An importer, Mary Amos, opined that SON has been embarking on enforcement exercises to rid the country of sub-standard goods.
She noted that many stakeholders in different sectors of the economy including the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have called on the present administration to empower more than ever before, the regulatory agency to perform its responsibilities.
The Group Head, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, SON Nwaoma Olujie urged consumers to look out for markings such as date of manufacturing, country of origin and manufacturer's name for traceability, adding that all the information are embossed on the cylinder.
She also urged Nigerians to purchase only cylinders with SON registration marks in order to safeguard their homes from fire incidents caused by substandard cylinders.
Mr Okereke said that his office was in charge of collecting value added and withholding taxes from all government agencies in Anambra State.

Nigeria is aiming to increase its crude oil reserve base to over 40 billion barrels and daily production to about 3 million barrels.
The experts, who gathered at the second summit on research activities in Nigeria's frontier basins, insisted that there was a need for collaboration and sustainability.
Currently, over 93 per cent of Nigeria's oil production comes from the Niger Delta basin but the Federal Government had stated that there was a need to explore other sedimentary basins, including Bida, Gongola, Sokoto, Benue Trough, Anambra and Dahomey in an attempt to diversify the country's hydrocarbon resources.
Already, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced the discovery of oil in Gongola basin and currently working on the commercial viability of the resources.
With over 11 research papers and other presentation by industry players focusing on 'Nigeria's Frontier Basins: Vehicle for Reserve Growth through R&D', the stakeholders noted that exploring the frontier basins remain timely, considering that the relevance crude oil dwindles as the international communities shift from oil.
Speaking at the event, which was sponsored by the National Centre for Petroleum Research and Development (NCPRD), Energy Commission of Nigeria in collaboration with the NNPC, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency and the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari, said there was need to intensify collaboration to achieve desired outcomes in the ongoing exploration activities in the frontier basins.
Kyari said NNPC would continue to lead the campaign to ensure that more works are carried out in the basins, with a view to increasing the nation's reserves, investment opportunities and create employment for the teeming youths in the Country.
He, however, noted that this feat could only be achieved through doggedness, consistency, creative thinking as well as innovative ideas and the deployment of new emerging technologies.
A statement signed by the Deputy Director and Head, Taxpayer Education and Enlightenment Team (TEET), Mrs Sylvia Tochukwu-Ngige, said that the campaign would hold from March 2 to March 7.

Kyari said NNPC was ready to actively collaborate with competent institutions of learning to carry out exploration activities, especially in the areas of geological and geophysical data generation, environmental baseline studies, drilling location preparation, among others, saying this would bridge the gap between the academia and the Industry.
Also speaking at the event, the Director-General,CEO, Energy Commission of Nigeria, Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, expressed total confidence in the collaborative capacity of NNPC to galvanize the commitment and leadership needed to achieve the expansion drive through research and development, as part of the goals of and target of the summit.
Activities for the week include visit of the president of CITN, Dame Gladys Simplice, who will use the opportunity to inaugurate a District Society of the Institute at Onitsha,' it said.
The Vice-Chancellor of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Prof. Abdulazeez Muhammad Ahmad, who said the university was part of the late 1990s exploration campaign in the Kolmani River-II of the Gongola Sub-basin of North-East Nigeria said though SNEPCo earlier reported a non-commercial gas discovery in Kolmani, the school independently studied another well Nasara-1 as a PhD research and indicated the presence of oil in the well-sourced from lacustrine sediments.
All staff of AIRS and some staff members of FIRS participated in the road show.
According to him, the finding earned NUC's best PhD award from all physical sciences from all Nigerian universities for the year 2006 as well as NMGS-Chevron best PhD award for the same year.
Over 100 representatives of key stakeholder groups in the agricultural sector met in Abuja on November 19, 2019, to validate results from several stakeholder consultative meetings organised to identify constraints hampering agricultural mechanisation in Nigeria and proffer recommendations for improvement with the aim of supporting the development of a national policy on agricultural mechanisation.
The one-day workshop captioned 'Agricultural Mechanisation Policy Validation Workshop' was organised by Propcom Mai-karfi, a UK government-funded rural market development programme implemented in Northern Nigeria.
The increasing demand for mechanisation among an estimated 77 million farmer population as well as factors limiting better use of Nigeria's agricultural mechanisation potential underscore the importance of reviewing the agricultural mechanisation policy within the present drive to make Nigeria more self-sufficient in its food requirements.
Some of these limiting factors reported by stakeholders are poor access to credit, high cost of agricultural equipment, minimal private sector engagement, weak advocacy and lack of a clear framework guiding implementation of the broad statements on agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy.
Developing an implementation plan for agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy, introducing policy on compulsory in-country assembly of tractors and other agricultural machinery, developing federal policy on land development and offering financial incentives to states to develop farmlands, expanding the mechanisation policy to comprise irrigation infrastructure, land clearing and post-harvest storage activities, and extending the zero-tariffs policy to tipping trailers and agricultural machinery spare parts are some recommendations proffered by stakeholders to address these limitations.
We hope to influence policy and help Nigeria define a path for improving mechanisation and expanding the required access to finance in Nigeria,' said Ogheneovo Ugbebor, Deputy Team Leader at Propcom Mai-karfi.
'The engagements and coming together of different agricultural stakeholders in Nigeria have actually gone up and we are seeing the benefits.
Mechanisation is a specialist area and it is something we must do well if we are to propel agriculture in Nigeria' ‚Äì Dr Chijioke Osuji, Federal University of Technology, Owerri.
Through this process it is evident that there are organisations that have interest in improving agricultural mechanisation in Nigeria.
With this great work that Propcom Mai-karfi is doing I am sure that in the next 5 years agricultural mechanisation will go a long way many more people, especially in rural areas, will benefit.
Said Felicia Nzomisaki, Permanent Secretary at the State Ministry of Agriculture, Adamawa State.
This is one of the few times in planning and policy processes for agricultural development where we have strict adherence to different components and stages of policy formulation before we arrive at a concise policy document, which in this case is the National Policy on Agricultural Mechanisation. ' ‚Äì Professor Ayoola Gboladade, Farm and Infrastructure Foundation (FIF).
Health Ministry says no trace of corona virus in Anambra, advocates for proper hygiene
Others present at the event were the Kano State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Hadi Bala Yahaya; Head of the Agriculture and Food Security Policy Commission of the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), Ms. Gloria Ekpo; Directors at the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), Drs. Segun Ademiluyi and Isaac Ozumba; and the Chairman of Tractor Owners and Hiring Facilities Association of Nigeria (TOHFAN), Alhaji Danladi Garba.
Awka, March 3, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Commissioner for Health, Dr Vincent Okpala says the state has no case of Corona Virus (COVID-19), within its territory.
I urge Ndi Anambra to go about their normal business, but step up observing normal hygiene in the state,' the commissioner said this while speaking with health correspondents in his office at the Jerome Udoji Secretariat Complex, Awka.
Dr Okpala noted that his ministry had put machineries in place to check contractors, businessmen and people coming in from affected countries in order to avoid having the disease in the state.
Holding such an inclusive event and bringing together key stakeholders and experts was a significant feat and the culmination of a long process from consultative meetings to policy recommendations.
The next action steps for stakeholders is further engagement with and support to the National Centre on Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), constituted by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), to develop the National Policy on Agricultural Mechanisation.
Telecommunications operators in the country have been handed a new order to either improve telephony services or face fresh forms of sanctions.
He urged Ndi Anambra to practice better hygiene by constantly washing their hands and to maintain clean environment in their various homes.
The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof.
Umar Danbatta, gave the warning at the weekend in Abuja, insisting that operators must to do everything possible to improve service delivery to the consumers on their various networks.
The EVC, who spoke through the Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau (CAB), NCC, Felicia Onwuegbuchulam, said though the Commission recognizes the existence of some challenges confronting the industry, operators are expected to strive to always improve service for the over 175 million subscribers in the country.
Where a service provider continues to fail to improve services to the detriment of the consumers, the Commission will apply appropriate regulatory actions and sanctions against such service provider, - Danbatta added.
Danbatta also affirmed that 'in the course of regulating the industry, the NCC had always recognised the importance of the consumer in the telecom sector and the fact that consumers deserve to have value for the money spent on telecoms services.
There is no case of Corona virus in Anambra. We are on ground to respond to any eventuality.
According to the EVC, the empowerment and protection of the consumer from unfair practices of service providers and others is a central item on the eight-Point Agenda.
The NCC Chief Executive informed consumers to always call the NCC toll-free number 622 to lodge unresolved or unsatisfactorily-resolved complaints earlier reported to their respective service providers so that NCC can institute necessary intervention on their behalf for redress.
Danbatta also encouraged consumers to make use of the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) 2442 Short Code to control unsolicited text messages instead of just complaining about unsolicited messages.
He advised that instead of just complaining it is more profitable than consumers take advantage of the facilities and channels of redress provided by NCC to tackle the challenges of telecom services.
Danbatta also praised telecom consumers for their patronage and urged all citizens to support the Commission in its desire to address the challenges of telecommunication, expand telecom services and increase the sector's contribution to the nation's economy.
We are tackling Lassa fever and Corona virus together. I want to re-assure you that we have checked out all the Chinese in the state and they are free from disease for now.
Telecomunications subscribers nationwide lodged 19,977 complaints against Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) between January and October this year.
From January to date we have examined five people that entered the state from China and they are all free from the disease, he said.
Billing issues include an unexplained change in the account balance and the inability to change tariff plans.
Concerning customer care, subscribers decried their inability to connect to help lines; alleged nonchalant attitude of agents; incorrect response from agents and other infractions.
Regarding quality of service in respect of about 179 million active subscribers in the country are to be protected, according to Sections 104, 105, and 106 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 .
According to a document obtained from the NCC yesterday, the four channels through which subscribers laid the complaints include the commission's Contact Centre (622); Consumer Portal against Service Providers; social media and correspondences.
Analysis by The Guardian of the document titled: 'Trend Analysis on Complaint Received from January to October 2019 in Consumer Affairs Bureau, 'showed that for the period under review, 18, 717 complaints were received via the 622 channel; 764 through the consumer portal; 315 via social media and 181 written words.
Of the 19,977 complaints, NCC was able to resolve 13, 282 while others are pending.
Compared to 2018, there was a major leap in complaint resolution this year.
The Guardian checks showed that across the channels in 2018, about 40, 380 complaints were received, while 24,281 got resolved.
The regulator claimed an average of 96.66 percent complaint resolution rate as against 57.65 percent in 2018 just as the contact center confirmed a 39.01 percent improvement.
For complaints from the consumer portal, there was also a leap from the 65.5 percent record of 2018 to 88.07 per cent in 2019, representing a 22.57 per cent progress.
Progressively, the social media platforms advanced from 50.56 per cent in 2018 to 74.93 per cent this year with complaint resolution posting a 24.37 per cent improvement.
However, for petitions, the scorecard fell with the commission acknowledging 53.22 percent as against the 86.47 percent tally of 2018, indicating a 33.25 percent decline.
Speaking on the document, the NCC Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, explained that the exercise was geared towards harnessing extant policies, regulations and guidelines for the protection, information, education and empowerment of telecommunications consumers in Nigeria.
Dr Okpala noted that adequate measure was in place to check participants in the ongoing police Games in the state.
According to him, anyone who comes in from China should stay indoors for two weeks; if he has fever should report immediately to any health facility across the state.
The commissioner said that it was because of high surveillance that made it possible to detect a victim of the virus in Lagos.
There are processes and structures that have been installed to fish out anyone who is infected with the virus.
Wash your hands regularly with soap, use hand sanitizers, keep a safe distance from anyone coughing or sneezing, avoid crowds and maintain good respiratory hygiene.
Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow when coughing or sneezing, stay indoors, if you feel unhealthy with symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty in breathing,' he urged.
Anambra 2020 Budget: Accelerating infrastructure development, youth entrepreneurship - a clarion call to support Gov. Obiano
In many societies, especially the under-developed, the bane of underdevelopment is usually poor human resource capacity, poor policy initiative and inadequate infrastructure to support and facilitate growth and development.
Inadequate infrastructure is also a result of poor policy formulation, faulty implementation of programmes as well as poor execution of projects.
At the mention of infrastructure development, the human mind readily goes to provision of access and motorable roads, regular electricity supply; provision of portable water.
Indeed, infrastructure means the basic facilities: services and installations needed for the effective and efficient functioning of a community, state or country. Consequently, the need for basic infrastructure cuts across all areas of human endeavour.
In Government, Budget is a statement or itemised summary of intended expenditures, usually coupled with expected revenue. The Budget is a social contract between the Government and the people. The budget, also spells out Government proposed recurrent and capital expenditures for a given period, usually a year.
The performance and success of a budget depends on the realisation of the projected revenue targets and their efficient and effective implementation.
Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) governor Godwin EmefieleA: Accidentally, the United States Central Bank ‚Äì The Federal Reserve ‚Äì stumbled on a powerful monetary policy tool in the 1920s.
After the First World War, the new regional Federal Reserve banks found they had almost no financial relationship with the banks they were supervising in their regions.
The implication of this was that these Federal Reserve banks could not generate any revenues to carry out their most basic obligations.
Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele.
In a bid to find other ways of earning money, early in 1992, the Federal Reserve banks started buying government bonds from banks so they could at least earn some interest.
It soon discovered something interesting ‚Äì as it bought the government securities from the banks, the banks reserves were boosted.
The second order effect of this was that interest rates started to come down as the banks all had more money to deploy.
Thus the Federal Reserve figured out that when credit was scarce and interest rates were high, it could buy up government securities from the banks to boost liquidity and lower those rates.
By extension the reverse was also true ‚Äì when there was too much money in circulation and interest rates were too low, it could sell government securities to banks.
By May 1922, the Federal Reserve decided to formalize this process and create what was called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to coordinate how this new powerful tool was to be used and when.
These days Open Market Operations (OMO) is nothing new of course but in 1922 one can only imagine how innovative they were.
All of a sudden there was a market tool which could be used as a lever to control interest rates without having to use any other crude methods.
Over the last 100 years since the invention of this tool, Central Banks across the world have borrowed and deployed it in their own countries to achieve the same goal of managing the supply of credit in the economy and interest rates in general.
Until the coming of the Great Godwin Emefiele, Nigeria's Central Bank governor, that is.
In the last 2 or so years in Nigeria, the meaning of OMO has been completely redefined.
The name remains the same and in the Central Bank's annual activity report, it still says that the purpose of its OMO activity is 'to moderate the excess banking system liquidity'.
On the face of it, that sounds like the same thing the US Fed discovered almost 100 years ago.
But when you dig deeper into what is going on in Nigeria, you see something totally different.
The first thing is to ask a simple question ‚Äì how come CBN's OMO involves foreign investors? Much of the securities being sold by the CBN to 'mop up' excess liquidity in the banking system is being bought by foreign investors.
Has the CBN finished mopping up the liquidity in Nigeria that it is now mopping up foreign liquidity as well? As anyone who has been following events knows, what happens is that the CBN sells securities to foreign investors at 'mouthwatering rates' that they cannot obtain elsewhere.
Since these foreign investors only have dollars and the CBN's securities are denominated in naira, the CBN takes their dollars and exchanges it to naira for them.
At the same time, it gives them a cast iron guarantee that when they need their dollars back in 1 years' time, it will sell it to them at an agreed rate no matter what the actual rate at that time is.
These investors then take their naira and buy securities from the CBN and count their interest for one year.
In 2018 alone, CBN sold a total of N22.4trn ($62bn) worth of OMO securities ostensibly to 'mop up' excess liquidity.
Anambra State before the advent of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was marred by chaos, armed robbery attacks, kidnapping, threat to life and, property as well as looting of public funds.
Was there really that much money sloshing around the Nigerian banking system that needed mopping up? At any rate, there was hardly any movement in interest rates during the year since the CBN itself needed to keep them high to keep attracting foreign investors to buy the securities.
Herein is the final evidence that if the inventors of OMO were to reincarnate in Nigeria today, they would not recognise their own creation.
Nigeria's OMO does not mop up excess liquidity and does not have any effect on interest rates.
So what is the best thing to call this redefined OMO? Nigeria owes the foreign investors who buy the OMO securities and it owes them in dollars.
The CBN has merely found a way to increase Nigeria's external debt using what Diezani Alison-Madueke famously called 'non transparent opacity'.
When you go to the Debt Management Office (DMO) website, what you see on the front page is FG's share of Nigeria's foreign debt that currently stands at $21bn.
As the CBN's OMO is mostly short term for 1 year, it is hard to tell how much the outstanding balance is.
But whenever the CBN decides to make this figure public, we should be honest enough to treat it as what it really is by adding it to the figure of Nigeria's external debt.
The Administration 1999-2003 was handcuffed, emasculated and strangulated to make way for celebrated looting of the Treasury, through the instrumentality of Irrevocable Payment Standing Order'.
Mr. Michael Akinwale is the General Manager of Rally Trade, an international online broker.
This paved the way for Government activities to be hijacked, and the state legislature attacked on the orders of Political Godfathers'. Salaries could not be paid. Ecological funds were not left out by the ravaging Political Godfathers.
In this interview with BENJAMIN ALADE, he speaks on opportunities in brokerage business, the need for Nigerians to have multiple streams of income and a regulatory environment for online brokers.
What is Rally Trade all about?.
Rally Trade is a financial service brokerage company.
We have a platform where people can trade in global financial markets.
It means looking at the global stock market- New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, French exchange, German exchange and other platforms where you can trade directly from Nigeria.
You can trade currencies, euro, pounds, and dollar.
We all know that prices from each country are always fluctuating, which means you can trade them against themselves to make money.
Lastly, commodities- gold, cocoa, aluminium, rubber, not in their physical form, but virtual form, are all on the market platform.
What do you see in Nigeria's economy at the moment?.
Well, based on our own business, it is a good time to be in Nigeria and the reason is that we are going through a transition period.
We are in a serious problem now.
First, people that have one job will find that the job alone can't help them again.
Secondly, there's no job, even for young and old alike.
We are in a time where we should be creating opportunities to solve the problems.
This will mean creating several other sources of income that people never know about.
It is a good time to be in business because we are now helping people now to start making money from a source they never thought existed.
While I was in school, I didn't know anything called trading, though it was existing, but because at that time, there was no technology to bring it here.
There was no Internet and mobile phone, so the trading could not come to Nigeria.
But now that the technology is here and everyone has a mobile phone, it's a good time to be in the business.
Is the business related to foreign exchange trading?.
That word foreign exchange (forex) is just one part of the market.
If I say currency, I mean forex.
But somebody can be trading indices, that is not trading financial currency.
So, foreign currency is just a part of the market and the business we do, not the whole market.
What opportunities for this business exist in Nigeria?.
There is great potential.
For any young person, I see the business as a career.
There's something about making money, but the other side is the career, something that you can be proud of and would want others to be part of.
What is the role of technology in business operations?.
Without mincing words, technology now is the bedrock of businesses.
Any company that is not technology-driven is headed for disaster.
Whenever we do our seminars, we always show people the fact that in the last 10 years, companies like Exxon Mobil, Shell, China Petroleum, were the biggest in the world then.
The biggest companies in the world now are Google, Microsoft, Apple.

Buhari Not Bothered About Criticisms By US, UK -Femi Adesina
He also said the Nigerian Government would pay no concern to the ultimatum issued by a group of civil societies.
Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to President Muhamadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has said the Nigerian Government was not bothered by criticisms from the United States, United Kingdom and European Union over human rights violations in Nigeria.
Speaking on Channels Television, Adesina said, 'We are not answerable to the US, UK or EU.
We are Nigeria, a sovereign country.
Those countries and entities have issues of their own.
Let them deal with their issues.
Let Nigeria also deal with her internal issues.
We are not answerable to them.
He also said the Nigerian Government would pay no concern to the ultimatum issued by a group of civil societies.
He said that genuine issues will be looked into.
We have had instances in which the government had to reverse itself because there were concerns raised.
It shows that the government is responsive but you cannot listen to a babble .
It will distract you from what you are doing .
Adesina also said that Prof Wole Soyinka, who had been a vocal critic of the lawlessness of the administration, was entitled to his opinion.
He added, We respect Prof Soyinka .
You don't have too many of them in the country or even on the continent.
He is an avatar and he is well respected but his opinion will remains his opinion.
It will be considered and if there are things to act on, we will act on them .

Buhari Slowing Down Nigeria's Progress ‚Äì Ondo Cleric
Speaking at a programme on Thursday in Akure, Giwa said the ruling All Progressives Congress government led by Buhari had made Nigerians regret voting them into power in 2015 due to its unfriendly polices.
Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ, a church based in Akure, Ondo State, Adewale Giwa, has said President Muhammadu Buhari was slowing down Nigeria's wheel of progress of Nigeria following his continued silence on human rights abuses and violation of court orders under his watch.
Speaking at a programme on Thursday in Akure, Giwa said the ruling All Progressives Congress government led by Buhari had made Nigerians regret voting them into power in 2015 due to its unfriendly polices.
He said, Nigeria is a blessed country but the leaders have failed to walk on God's paths.
If you are not a wicked leader, you would not have been watching your tribe killing another tribe without bringing them to justice.
If you are a good leader, you would not have jailed innocent people and allowed killers to move freely in the country .
If you are a God-fearing man, you would have fulfilled all the promises you made during the electioneering campaigns .
This style of leadership is slowing down Nigeria's progress .
Buhari's Fight Against Corruption Profoundly Disappointing - Ex-Presidential Adviser
A former political adviser in the Presidency, Dr Usman Bugaje, has described President Muhammadu Buhari's fight against corruption as one that is profoundly disappointing.
Bugaje said this while speaking at the 25th anniversary of the Serikin Fulani of Lagos State, Dr Mohammad Bambado II.
Bugaje also condemned the incessant attacks by Boko Haram sect in the country, incompetent politicians whose only way of winning is through manipulation of religion and ethnicity .

He urged the government to find a lasting solution to rising unemployment in the country, saying if not arrested, it poses a big threat to the country, Daily Trust reports.
Buhari's Secret Emissaries To Sowore Proved Mission Impossible By Bayo Oluwasanmi
President Buhari's emissaries to Sowore proved mission impossible because the history of tyranny is also the history of its eventual defeat.
The Great King of Persia was checked at Marathon and Salamis.
Napoleon was checked at Waterloo.
Hitler was checked on D-Day.
The Soviet Empire collapsed .
The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins . - Soren Kierkegaard
Last week, Premium Times reported that President Muhammadu Buhari on two separate occasions sent secret emissaries to Omoyele Sowore in the Department of State Services ' gulag 'to extract a commitment from him to back down on the 'revolution now' protest as a precondition for his release ' .
Similarly, those who engage in the sale of these items are also warned to desist from such business as buyers, users and sellers are culpable under the law.
He added that the police was ready to secure the lives and properties of citizens and residents of the state during Yuletide.
Climate Change: Ministry Of Environment, Eko Carbon Exchange Partner To Reduce Emission In Nigeria
The initiative, which was announced during the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties in Madrid, Spain, also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.
In a bid to reduce the effects of climate change in Nigeria and indeed the entire African continent, the Federal Ministry of Environment and other government agencies have partnered with Eko Carbon Exchange to achieve the target.
The initiative, which was announced during the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties in Madrid, Spain, also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.
The UN Conference in Spain attracted African and international experts and sustainability actors including from Nigeria, who all discussed how to protect the continent from the harsh effects of climate change.
Managing Director of Eko Carbon Exchange, Mr Innocent Azih, disclosed that the initiative, being the first in West Africa, was mobilising to harness the opportunities in low-carbon development across all economic sectors in Nigeria, starting with solid waste and transport sectors.
He said this will also serve as a regional vehicle for mobilising finance for low-carbon economic development for West African economies through the Clean Development Mechanism.
Azih stated, 'The objective is to mobilise the necessary resource pool and low-carbon finance required for greening all economic sectors.'
Head of Climate Change Mitigation in the Ministry of Environment, Hajia Aisha Jibril, revealed the readiness of the ministry to work with the Exchange to enable Nigeria achieve the nationally determined contributions through projects implementation that are fully mainstreamed.
She described efforts made by the ministry to include policy incentives, education and awareness of actors through climate change desks at state levels, to development of the Nigerian carbon emission registry.
She urged stakeholders to follow Eko Carbon Exchange's lead and partner with the ministry to ensure early realisation of the registry.
Also speaking at the UN meeting, Chief Executive Officer of Natural Eco Capital, Dr Eugene Itua, in his submission noted that tremendous emission reduction programmes have been on in Lagos State through the replacement of outdated mass transport vehicles with more modern and energy-efficient buses.
Stakeholders noted that finance remained a major challenge to scaling green investments but suggested that the best approach was non-monetary strategy in which financing packages for low-carbon consumption comes with credit and insurance.
Closure Of Border Cannot End Smuggling, ECOWAS Tells Nigeria
Disagreeing with President Buhari, ECOWAS stated that the border closure would also affect the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Act signed by the country.
Nigeria Cameroon border
The Economic Community Of West African States has told the Nigerian Government that closing its border with other neighbouring countries cannot prevent the smuggling of goods and products into Nigeria.
President Muhammadu Buhari had announced the closure of the border, saying that it would prevent bringing products into the country illegally and also help boost the patronage of locally made products.
Disagreeing with President Buhari, ECOWAS stated that the border closure would also affect the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Act signed by the country.
In a statement on Tuesday, the bloc said,'The ECOWAS Parliament calls for compliance with community provisions and the reopening of borders and a coordinated fight against smuggling in the region.
The root causes of this recurrent situation must be studied with a view to finding a permanent solution.
Comparing Omoyele Sowore's #RevolutionNow To Boko Haram Insurgency, A Needless Escalation By Kayode Ogundamisi
Now is the time for the government to stop the disobedience of court orders, no one is above the law including activists and people in government .
if you must prosecute Sowore and others then let it be open, free and transparent.
Otherwise, thus far the state has made a mess of the case, this is looking more like persecution than prosecution.
If the government has a thinking cap on, it will #FreeSoworeNow or at the least let the case in court continue without infractions .
I read the statement by the Presidency on the Sowore-Bakare treason trial.
This statement is a needless escalation, particularly the comparison with Boko Haram insurgency.
If the allegations are completely true, why is the Department of State Services disobeying court orders?
One would think the state will be eager to bring its evidence to the open.
If the Presidency and the DSS are confident of Omoyele Sowore's ability and capabilities to 'violently overthrow the government', why can't the state simply let the judicial process proceed without interference as seen in the agency's disobedience of two court orders and the recent show of force by carrying out an arrest when you could have easily invited Sowore or picked him up at his residence in Abuja with a court warrant?
The President Muhammadu Buhari government is making a grave mistake, attracting negative local and international commentaries, a distraction the government does not need at any time, particularly now.
Now is the time for the government to stop listening to the The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), should review the Sowore and Bakare's case file and do the needful (drop the treason charges) and if the state is confident of its case, then let the case proceed in a transparent and open manner.
When Sowore committed what was an obvious infraction such as defacing a public property in Lagos, an offence that could get an easy conviction in a Lagos environmental court, the government looked the other way
A sign the state isn't interested in enforcing our laws but to bring up charges with stringent conditions that can drag on for long and keep alleged offenders in jail awaiting trial for a long period.
The treason charges the state is now relying on is unlikely to stand in an open trial, thus the request for a secret trial and anonymous witnesses.
Sowore's followership on social media run into millions of people who find it easy to 'comment' 'like' 'follow' his broadcasts, but no evidence the millions have translated into a mass movement.
Nigerians are disappointed, angry and have always wanted a change but not reckless enough to follow an unplanned idealistic 'revolution' with no road map, even the DSS should have known this.
The danger to Nigeria isn't the Sowore and his group, the government should review how the intelligent agencies arrive at largely fictitious 'security reports'.
Now it is the Nigerian Government and the DSS that are promoting #RevolutionNow by aiming to kill a fly with a nuclear bomb with attendant negative impact. It is the government now ascribing some imaginary powers to Omoyele Sowore and his armless group, a sign of insecurity on the part of the government.
Each infraction by the government will attract more sympathy.
It is the case of David against Goliath.
Give this group a designated space to protest and a platform to vent and you will see not all Nigerians agree with some of the solutions being proffered by the group.
Omoyele Sowore and his group are being lionised by the state.
Nigeria's elite security is now acting like a gangster enforcer.
The government should review its so-called counter-insurgency strategy and stop applying failed tactics.
The irony is that the government already had half of what it wants legally by securing one of the harshest bail conditions against a suspect.
The judge had in a ruling on October 4 granted Sowore bail in the sum of N100m and two sureties in the same amount and barred him from travelling out of Abuja.
Why rearrest Sowore when he's already restricted to Abuja ?
Is the DSS saying it does not have the capability to mount surveillance on one man in Abuja ?
For the record, I am no supporter of #RevolutionNow.
I have seen how recklessness can destabilise fragile states but evidence of alleged infractions is better presented in court without the state acting as if it is insecure and desperate to keep a
Now is the time for the government to stop the disobedience of court orders, no one is above the law including activists and people in government.
But if you must prosecute Sowore and others then let it be open, free and transparent. Otherwise, thus far the state has made a mess of the case, this is looking more like persecution than prosecution.
If the government has a thinking cap on, it will #FreeSoworeNow or at the least let the case in court continue without infractions.
Dammy Krane Granted N50,000 Bail By Court
He was arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos over a three-count allegation bothering on breach of public peace .
Hip-hop artiste, Johnson Oyindamola widely known as Dammy Krane, has been granted bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety in like sum.
He was arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos over a three-count allegation bothering on breach of public peace.
The musician was accused of making statements capable of breaching public peace and threatening the lives of staff of Merrybet Gold Limited on July 25.
According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened sections 301, 412 and 168 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him by the police.
His lawyer, Adebayo Oniyelu, while applying for his bail, said the defendant was 'a well-known musician who had not been convicted of any crime in the past'.
He also said that the defendant would not interfere with the prosecution of the matter if granted bail, noting that Dami Krane had been in prison custody since Friday.
Opposing the application for bail, prosecuting counsel J. I Enang, said he ordinarily would not have objected to the application for bail if it were not a national issue.
But when asked how the case was a national issue, Enang said it would be revealed at the right time.
He said, 'Your Honour, while coming to court today, I already heard it on the radio that a musician was to be arraigned today, it is even an international issue.'
Interjecting, Oniyelu informed the court that the case was one of breach of contract.
'The musician performed for the complainant and they are owing to him N1m.
'He reached out to them to request for his money but they refused to listen to him, forcing him to go on air to say that they were owing to him. The next thing that happened was his arrest.'
The magistrate, A. F. O Botoku, adjourned the matter until October 11 for the commencement of trial .

Dangote Flour Mill Shares Suspended On Floor Of Stock Exchange Ahead Of Takeover
This will be the second time the company will get sold in the last seven years after it was bought by South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012 and returned three years later.
The Nigeria Stock Exchange on Tuesday effected a full suspension on the trading of shares of Dangote Flour Mills as a precursor to its delisting and takeover by Crown Flour Mills.
This will be the second time the company will get sold in the last seven years after it was bought by South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012 and returned three years later.
The suspension is imperative to prevent trading in the shares of the company beyond the effective date of the scheme of arrangement for Crown Flour Mills Limited to acquire the entire issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in DFM held by scheme shareholders, subsequent to which the company would be delisted from the main board of the NSE
The board of directors of the company had in April received an offer from Olam ‚Äì the parent company of Crown Flour Mill for the sale of the company.
The firm and the board agreed to pay N130bn for five billion worth of ordinary shares listed by DFM.
The board proposed to make the offer to its shareholders on August 5 through a high court ordered meeting that was scheduled to hold on October 14.
Tiger Foods sold DFM back to Dangote in 2015 for a single dollar after it had acquired the company for $200m.
The company had made losses in the years it was owned by the South African firm.
DFM again announced that it made a loss of N1.16bn just before it agreed to sell the firm to Olam.
Experts say Olam's acquisition of the staggering firm is an attempt to expand its influence in the country's confectionery space through Crown, which it purchased in 2010.
Dangote Flour Records Negatives In Q3 Result
Highlights of the group's third quarter result indicates that the company lost N6.84bn.
Dangote Flour, which is soon to be sold to Crown Flour ‚Äì a subsidiary of Olam, is piling up losses for its coming investors.
Highlights of the group's third quarter result indicates that the company lost N6.84bn.
The wheat milling firm earned N76.75bn in the quarter ending September 30.
It had previously netted in revenues worth N83.29bn in the period ending June 30.
This is a loss of 7.85 per cent.
Proshare reports that the firm's loss before tax increased by 316.75 per cent to N9.64bn.
Its loss after tax soared by 309.69 per cent to N6.84bn.
The firm's net asset also decline by 28.97 per cent to N39.
It's before tax losses was occasioned by increased cost of sales, distribution and administration.
In April, the board of directors of Dangote Flour approved a 100 per cent take over from Olam.
Dangote sold over 60 per cent of the company's stake to South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012.
That relationship lasted for three years.
It climaxed in Africa's richest man repossessing his firm for just a dollar.
In 2013 and 2014, Dangote Flour was on the loss trail.
Its scorecard in 2018 amounted to a deficit of N1.16bn.
Experts have said the firm is not strategic to the Dangote Group, hence its laggard performances and double change of ownership in six years.

Death Of A Nation: Biafra and the Nigerian question By Chido Onumah
There are two basic questions that must be answered by all Nigerians.
One, do we want to remain as one country ?
Two, if the answer is yes, under what conditions ? ‚Äì Chief Bola Ige
To paraphrase the historian, mathematician, journalist, Marxist, and progressive thinker, Edwin Madunagu, every political history has its significant dates, landmarks or turning points.
In Nigeria's political history, for instance, landmarks would include:
October 1, 1960 - The day Nigeria gained independence from Britain
January 15, 1966 - When the first of what would become a tradition of military coups occurred
July 6, 1967 - The official start of the 30-month Nigeria-Biafra war .
January 15, 1970 - The official end of the civil war .
On May 27, 50 years ago, Yakubu Gowon, who served as head of state of Nigeria from 1966 to 1975, perhaps in anticipation of the audacious move by the Military Governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Lt. Col. Emeka Ojukwu, announced the division of Nigeria into 12 states from four regions.
The division of Nigeria into 12 states and Ojukwu's declaration of Biafra were decisions that would change the country forever.
Gowon's action did not only alter the structure of Nigeria, it led to the reconstruction of the nascent nation through the lenses of the so-called Nigerian military; a military that was provincial in outlook as it was ill-equipped for leadership.
The military centralized economic and political power and moved Nigeria from a federal republic to a unitary state.
In many ways, we can conveniently say May 27, 1967, was the day Nigeria began to unravel and any attempt to understand the current crises and our inability to make progress as a nation must necessarily return to the action of the military junta on May 27, 1967.
Three days later, May 30, 1967, Lt. Col Ojukwu, a Nigerian soldier of Igbo extraction declared an 'independent sovereign state of the name and title of the Republic of Biafra .
Officially excising the Eastern Region from Nigeria .
Ojukwu based his action on the resolution, four days earlier, on May 26, 1967, of a joint conference of the Eastern consultative assembly and leaders of thought that asked him to declare the Eastern region as a separate republic at an 'early practicable date .
The declaration of Biafra was the culmination of a series of tragic events .
First was the bloodletting that started with the January 15, 1966, military coup .
That coup led to the assassination of Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Belewa, the country's first and only prime minister and Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of the Northern Region, among other high-profile casualties .
Some recollections by Edwin Madunagu in 'Settling account with Biafra (The Guardian, May 4, 2000) are apposite here:
One: the politics of the First Republic (1960-1965) was heavily characterized by ethnicity, especially towards the end of that tragic period .
Two: Of the five army majors that are more frequently mentioned as leading the coup attempt, only one, Major Adewale Ademoyega, was non-Igbo by ethnic origin .
Three: No Igbo political leader died and the only Igbo military casualty occurred not because he was a target but because he was considered a 'nuisance' .
Four: The attempted coup was the culmination of a long period of political crisis in Nigeria .
A crisis whose centre of gravity was Western Region where, before the military intervention, the crisis had become an armed popular uprising .
On July 29, 1966, there was another military coup led by officers from Northern Nigeria and Lt. Col Yakubu Gowon became head of state.
According to Madunagu, the coupists 'first made a move to pull the Northern Region out Nigeria, but when they were advised that they were now in a military situation to rule the whole country, instead of a part of it, they dropped the idea of secession and became champions of 'One Nigeria'.
Lt. Col Ojukwu refused to recognize Lt. Col Gowon as head of state.'
The second coup led to the assassination, among other high-profile casualties, of the country's first military head of state, Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi, an Igbo, as well as the military governor of the Western Region, Lt. Col. Adekunle Fajuyi.
This was followed by, as Madunagu notes, 'mass killings not only in the North but all over the country, except the Eastern Region.
Now, multiply the May 1966 tragedy by a factor of 50, add to it the fact that the killings were now led by armed soldiers whose commanders were now in power and add to this the fact that the killings did not abate for at least five months and you begin to have an idea of what happened.'
The criminal indifference of the Nigerian state to the manifest pogrom against people from Eastern Nigeria, particularly Igbos, the repudiation by the Nigerian contingent (and the 'unilateral implementation' by the Eastern regional government) of the agreement on decentralization of power reached at a meeting in Aburi, Ghana, involving the main protagonists, Yakubu Gowon and Emeka Ojukwu, at the instance of Gen. Ankrah of Ghana, finally paved the road to Biafra.
The accounts of what took place in those turbulent days are as varied as there are ethnic groups in Nigeria.
But one thing is certain:
The effects of those events, particularly the actions of May 27 and 30, 1967, are still being felt today .
In one fell swoop, the military unilaterally restructured Nigeria according to its dictates.
While Ojukwu drafted 'unwilling' minorities in the Eastern Region to create a Biafran state where Igbos were in the majority, the Nigerian military which was nothing but the armed wing of a reactionary feudal class that had power thrust on it at independence began the implementation of an agenda of conquest.
Interestingly, barely a year earlier, the section of the military that seized power after the January 15, 1966 coup had attempted to reconstruct Nigeria as a unitary state with the promulgation of the unification decree 34 of 1966.
That attempt was opposed fiercely by those (including a section of the military) who felt they had lost out in the power equation. The rest is history.
When history repeats itself
Unfortunately, Nigeria is on the cusp of that tragic history repeating itself.
Regrettably, 50 years after the declaration of Biafra many young Nigerians of Igbo descent are trying to recreate Biafra.
In a few days, there will be events in Nigeria and around the world to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Biafra on May 30, 1967.
Forty-seven years after the end of the Nigeria-Biafra War, Biafra still resonates with individuals and groups within and outside the country; perhaps, a testament to the fact that the war hasn't ended in the minds of the protagonists and victims .
The reality is that many of the issues that propelled the civil war are still with us today.
So, how do we deal with this conundrum ?
Is Biafra the solution ?
In other words, can we solve the problems of 2017 Nigeria using the tragic solution of 50 years ago ?
As S.M. Sigerson noted in The Assassination of Michael Collins:
What Happened at B√©al na mBl√°th ?
A nation which fails to adequately remember salient points of its own history is like a person with Alzheimer's.
And that can be a social disease of a most destructive nature .
Seventeen years ago, Edwin Madunagu, in the piece referenced above, admonished
The young Nigerians now threatening to actualize Biafra (to) forget or shelve the plan.
In place of 'actualisation', they should, through research and study, reconstruct the Biafran story in its fullness and complexity and try to answer the unanswered questions and supply the missing links in the story.
This is a primary responsibility you owe yourselves:
You should at least understand what you want to actualise .
If 30 years after Biafra, you want to produce its second edition, you need to benefit from the criticism of the first.
History teaches that a second edition of a tragic event could easily become a farce‚Äîin spite of the heroism of its human agencies .
On the other hand, those who enjoy ridiculing Biafra‚Äîinstead of studying it‚Äîare politically shortsighted.
My own attitude to Biafra is neither 'actualisation' nor ridicule .
I propose that accounts should be settled with Biafra .
Madunagu's admonition needs no elaboration .
It is clear enough for the young people pushing for the actualization of Biafra, many of whom were born after the end of the Biafra war 47 years ago .
The aspect of his position on Biafra that I want to focus on is the aspect that warns of the 'political shortsightedness of ridiculing Biafra' .
Balkanizing the nation
When the military regime headed by Gowon divided Nigeria into 12 states, it sought to weaken the prospect of the different groups in the Eastern Region uniting against the Nigerian state .
Of course, that action was music to the ears of minority groups, particularly those in the Eastern Region, who had long demanded their own state .
With the creation of states, however, the military not only unilaterally abrogated the geo-political structure that existed then, it went a step further to destroy the principle of federalism on which Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and which had sustained and kept the country together.
We need to understand that this principle was adopted not only to assuage the fear of domination by a single group in the country but as recognition of the differences (multi-ethnic and multi-lingual) of the various 'ethnic nationalities' that were brought together to create Nigeria.
Part of Gowon's broadcast on May 27, 1967, signaling the breakup of Nigeria into 12 states is pertinent here:
The main obstacle to future stability in this country is the present structural imbalance in the Nigerian Federation .
Even Decree No.8 or Confederation or 'loose association' will never survive if any one section of the country is in a position to hold the others to ransom.
This is why the first item in the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council last month is the creation of states for stability .
This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination.
Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people.
As soon as these are established, a new revenue allocation commission consisting of international experts will be appointed to recommend an equitable formula for revenue allocation taking into account the desires of the states .
I propose to act faithfully within the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council and published last month.
The world will recognize in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country and to accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.
I have ordered the re-imposition of the economic measures designed to safeguard federal interests until such time as the Eastern Military Governor abrogates his illegal edicts on revenue collection and the administration of the federal statutory corporations based in the East.
The country has a long history of well-articulated demands for states .
The fears of minorities were explained in great detail and set out in the report of the Willink Commission appointed by the British in 1958 .
More recently, there have been extensive discussions in Regional Consultative Committees and leaders-of-thought conferences .
Resolutions have been adopted demanding the creation of states in the North and in Lagos .
Petitions from minority areas in the East which have been subjected to violent intimidation by the Eastern Military Government have been publicized .
While the present circumstances regrettably do not allow for consultations through plebiscites, I am satisfied that the creation of new states as the only possible basis for stability and equality is the overwhelming desire of the vast majority of Nigerians .
To ensure justice, these states are being created simultaneously .
To this end, therefore, I am promulgating a decree which will divide the Federal Republic into 12 states .
The 12 states will be six in the present Northern Region, three in the present Eastern Region, the Mid-Western will remain as it is, the Colony Province of the Western Region and Lagos will form a new Lagos State and the Western Region will otherwise remain as it is .
What the military regime of Gowon gave with one hand it took with the other .
And that would become the hallmark of subsequent military regimes in Nigeria .
Gowon failed to realize, or deliberately ignored the reality that the issue wasn't the division of the country but the reluctance or inability of the military to keep its promise
This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination .
Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people .
Unfortunately, that never happened .
It couldn't have, considering the rapacious and parasitic nature of the Nigerian military so-called and the interest it represented and still represents .
Once the military couldn't deliver on that promise, it also meant that the second part of its declaration that:
'The world will recognise in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country' and
'To accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country,' was nothing but meaningless soundbite by a rampaging military sub-class in desperate search for legitimacy.
Since then, there has neither been 'justice nor fair play for all sections' of Nigeria.
There hasn't been any serious attempt to 'accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country .
The sham of a federation that the military created has evolved into a Frankenstein's monster. Fast forward 50 years.
Cleary, it is the nebulous federal government that is holding the country to ransom. The moment the military government took economic powers from the states, there was no way we could ensure justice and fair play.
And once you can't ensure justice and fair play, there is no way you can stop the concomitant disquiet.
The politics of state creation
When Gen Murtala Muhammed created additional seven states‚Äîthree in the 'South' and four in the 'North'‚Äîbringing the total to 19 states, and a new federal capital territory, Abuja, on February 3, 1976, ten days before his assassination on February 13, he left no one in doubt that the conquest was real.
While Gowon showed an inclination to balance Nigeria geo-politically, Muhammed ensured that the 'North' had ten states while the 'South' had nine .
It has been alleged that the decision was to create four new states in the 'North' and four new states in the 'South', but when Muhammed announced the creation of states, instead of creating two states (Cross River and Akwa Ibom States) out of the old South-Eastern State, he simply announced the transformation of South-Eastern State into Cross River State.
Subsequent military regimes continued the conquest, not just on the political front, but on the economic front as well .
Ten years later, in 1986, when the self-professed evil genius, Gen Ibrahim Babangida, set up a Political Bureau to review the country's political and democratic system, one of its recommendations was the creation of an additional state (Akwa Ibom State) in 'South' to create a geo-political balance of ten states each between the 'North' and 'South' .
Babangida spurned that recommendation .
He did create Akwa Ibom State, but he added another state (Katsina State) in the 'North' to maintain the imbalance .
It was the same pattern that was adopted in subsequent state creation in 1991 (under Gen Babangida) and 1996 (under Gen Sani Abacha) .
Geo-politically, today, Nigeria is composed of 36 states: 19 states in the 'North' and 17 states in the 'South' .
Ordinarily, this should not matter .
After all, in a federation, the federating units (states) are supposed to manage their affairs substantially and contribute to the sustenance of the Federation.
Therefore, only those who feel their states can sustain themselves would clamor for the creation of such states .
Of course, more self-sustaining states would mean more opportunities for the national government to benefit from the exploration and exploitation of resources in every state.
Unfortunately, that is not the case with Nigeria.
In a country where the military had hijacked and centralized the control of economic resources and political power by, for example, arrogating to itself the authority to create local governments as well as placing itself in the position of chief dispenser of funds based on its own criteria, including population, land mass, number of local governments, derivation principle, etc.
The dog eat dog demand for states was inevitable.
Thanks to the military‚Äîthe armed wing of Nigeria's dominant power bloc‚ÄîNigeria has a weird federation where states can't create their own local governments; where local governments are listed in constitutions that have been nothing but military decrees writ large.
Thanks to the military, Nigeria has spurned justice and fair play and disregarded the genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.
It is not for nothing that Nigeria is described as a federal republic.
It was a choice made by the three regions in Nigeria preceding independence.
Both the Eastern and Western regions obtained internal self-government (independence) in 1957, while the North got same in 1959.
Each region could have opted to go its own way in 1960.
We could have had three countries as opposed to one at independence.
The decision by the regions to be part of a shared territory called Nigeria came with some obligation and expectation.
There is little to suggest that the federating region were willing to jettison the greater part of their economic and political independence for the sake of 'one Nigeria' .
In 1963, the regions (the precursor of our current states) controlled 50 percent of the revenues accruing from their region
Today we are quibbling whether the states have right to as little as 13 percent.
In a sense, this manifest heist by the federal government has perpetuated injustice in some sections of the country while condoning indolence in others .
It is this quest for control or lack of, that is at the heart of the Nigerian crisis .
Biafra of the mind vs Biafra of the field
What is Biafra ?
If that question was tough to answer in 1967, it is even more difficult today, fifty years after .
As a nation, Biafra was going to be difficult to sustain even if it had been actualized .
Was Biafra a nation made up of ethnic nationalities ?
In other words, was Biafra a microcosm of Nigeria ?
One of the things those who are agitating for Biafra have not been able to define or communicate effectively is an answer to the question: What is Biafra ?
The answers to this question are as varied as there are agitators .
There are those who will tell you that Biafra encompasses the area that used to be the Eastern Region of Nigeria and beyond, including parts of Southern Cameroon and stretching to Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.
Some define Biafra as simply the former Eastern Region of Nigeria that was given the name Biafra on May 30, 1967.
Some say it is the five states (Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo) in south-east Nigeria where the Igbos are the major ethnic group .
Yet, others define Biafra as encompassing all the Igbo-speaking areas of southern Nigeria, including parts of present-day Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Benue States.
The issue of definition is important because the lack of understanding and agreement can pose great problems .
Of course, up until May 30, 1967, there was nothing like Biafra as nation or political territory.
The only thing that bore the tag Biafra was a bight off the West African coast, in the easternmost part of the Gulf of Guinea, stretching to Cape Lopez in Gabon, over which Britain established a colonial protectorate in 1849.
Biafra as a nation was a child of circumstance that would become a child of necessity.
What if the bloody January 15, 1966, coup and the attendant assassinations didn't happen ?
If Igbo political leaders had been killed alongside their counterparts from the 'North' and 'West';
If the 'revenge coup' of July 29, 1966, and the attendant murders didn't occur;
If the Nigerian state had reined in the murderous groups (military and civilian) that had targeted Igbos after the July 29 coup;
If Gen Aguiyi Ironsi‚Äîthe first indigenous general and leader of the Nigerian Army‚Äîan Igbo who was not part of the January 15 abortive coup, had not been a major beneficiary by seizing power and becoming head of state;
If Gen Ironsi had executed the coup plotters of January 15 as military tradition dictates;
If the regime of Gen Ironsi did not promulgate Decree No. 34 ‚Äî which abrogated the country's federal structure in exchange for a unitary one;
If the 'January 15 boys' had completed their 'project' either by one of them becoming head of state or as some have alluded, released the imprisoned leader of the national opposition, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and installed him as prime minister;
If the Nigerian government led by Gowon had implemented the agreement reached at Aburi ?
The secret police had stormed the place to effect the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, who was standing trial in a case brought against him by the Nigerian Government.
Sowore was first arrested on August 3, 2019 by the DSS for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The government is accusing him of insulting President Buhari and planning to bring down his regime.
He was rearrested by the DSS on Friday less than 24 hours after being released on bail after 125 days in detention.
Chairman of Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, moved the motion for the probe of the court invasion by the DSS.
Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, instructed the committee to begin legislative procedure on the matter and report next week.

Queen's College Student To Face Disciplinary Panel Over Artificial Eyelashes
The college's Parents-Teachers Association have condemned the girl's mother seen in a viral video harassing a security guard of the school because her daughter was punished, according to The Nation.
Queen's College was founded as a girls' school in 1927 during the colonial era
More details have emerged about what transpired in the viral video of a Queen's College pupil harassed out of the college for wearing artificial eyelashes and painting her nails.
The college's Parents-Teachers Association have condemned the girl's mother seen in a viral video harassing a security guard of the school because her daughter was punished, according to The Nation.
The girl had resumed two weeks late after midterm on Monday and was being punished for wearing artificial eyelashes and painted nails.
However, unknown to her teachers, her mother was watching but did not identify herself.
Trouble started when she attempted to drag the girl out of the school and the security man (not knowing she was the mother) challenged her.
The mother reacted by attacking the security guard.
A source said, 'The girl was returning to school two weeks after the mid-term had ended.
When the teachers saw her with eyelashes and painted nails, they asked her to kneel down.
Her mother came in with her, sat down and listened but did not say anything.
Someone heard her telling her daughter in Igbo that she should run away.
But the girl refused.
After the third time, the mother grabbed the girl's bag and made to leave.
When people realised that she was the girl's mother, she quickly dragged the girl out. The security man did not did not know it was the girl's mother dragging her out.
In an attempt to ask why she was taking one of our students out, that was when she attacked the security man.
The girl was even remorseful .
She was asking the mother why she was disgracing her .
The source said the girl was returned to school by her mother on Tuesday and would face disciplinary measures.
The source added, the woman came to drop the girl around 5:00am in the morning urging her to sneak into her class.
But the girl did not sneak .
She stood by the security gate till morning and presented herself to the school management.
A man who claimed to be her father came to the school to apologise on her behalf but we found out that he is not her father .
She will face the disciplinary committee .
Many people ‚Äì including the state, are now interested in the case .
So we are investigating .
In a statement, the Caretaker Committee of the College's PTA noted that the association was in support of the school management's position on discipline .
The statement reads: We condemn in totality the action of the parent .
We stand by the management in enforcing discipline in the school .
However, the Committee will invite both the parent and the student with a view to ameliorating the situation and preventing a repeat of similar occurrence .
The lesson we need to take home on this is simply that Queen's College will not tolerate violation of its well settled rules and regulations.'
Questions Amaechi Should Answer On Transportation University By Olabisi Deji-Folutile
Honestly, Nigeria should concentrate on building its research capacity and developing innovative curricula that will help its students develop the crucial skills of creativity and critical thinking.
These are some of the things that can make Nigeria relevant in the development space.
I never believed Nigeria was serious about starting a Transportation University until Monday when President Muhammadu Buhari and other government officials commissioned the project in Daura, the President's home town.
The university, according to Transportation Minister, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, is a response to the question of how Nigeria would maintain and manage its railway infrastructure.
The reason given notwithstanding, the whole gamut of excitement that characterized the groundbreaking ceremony, suggests something else.
Going by the way the minister resorted to insults and vituperation on Nigerians that dared to query the rationale for establishing the university in the President's home town;
It appears the project was borne out of political contingency than any other reason.
Besides, Amaechi stole the show at the ceremony that ordinarily should have been organised by the ministry of education and the National Universities Commission in conjunction with the Transportation ministry
From the minister's excitement, it is as if the transportation university is the best thing that has ever happened to Nigeria in recent times.
He boasted about how he forced the China Civil Engineering Construction Company to undertake the project by refusing to sign the contract for Lagos-Ibadan Rail project and how he also forced the company to take some Nigerians to China for training in railway technology .
The Director of Rail Services of the Federal Ministry of Transportation, Mohammed Babakobi, didn't help matter, as he too, was more concerned about why the university must be in the President's town.
Amaechi's action, reminds me of the popular Yoruba adage that says forcing a man to get married is not a big deal, but making him to make provision for the family is the real work .
Beyond constructing a university structure, there are numerous questions that Amaechi must answer to convince Nigerians that he understands what he is doing .
For example, he needs to come clear on who owns the university and the institution that is funding it .
Is it to be fully funded by the Chinese government or partly funded by the Federal Government ?
The only reason why anybody should be excited about a transportation university in Nigeria at a time like this as far as I am concerned is if the CCECC is fully running it as a gift to Nigeria .
But, if all that CCECC is doing is to construct a university as part of its corporate social responsibility, then Amaechi's display of a sense of achievement is totally misplaced .
If government wants to develop transportation, what stops it from expanding transport departments in existing universities ?
The Institute of Transportation in Zaria is there as well as many others .
The Federal Government could have simply increased the capacity of existing institutions to provide better manpower and training in the sector.
For me, it doesn't make any difference where the university is sited.
I believe the current administration has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does not have any iota of regard for federal character.
President Buhari showed the direction his administration would follow with his very first set of appointments and he has continued on that path ever since.
So, there is no point dissipating energy on something that is not likely to change.
The reason given by President Buhari for establishing the Transportation University is even more interesting.
According to him, the university will bring rapid development to the nation's transport sector and generate both academic and non-academic employment opportunities to Nigerians.
How can a Federal Government struggling to fund its 43 universities be on an adventure of establishing more ?
A lot of people, including our leaders, know that Nigeria's federal universities are nothing to write home about.
This is one of the reasons why you are not likely to find children of the President, governors and other political leaders in these universities.
Many of the university administrators are struggling to cope.
Recently, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, revealed that what the university was getting as overhead was less than N100m, whereas it needs a minimum of N800m for overhead.
The VC wondered where universities were expected to get money from when reacting to lawmakers' call for cancellation of admission fees in Nigeria's tertiary institutions .
The VC said what the university gets from the Federal Government in one year is not enough to fund it in a month .
How soon can this Transportation University catch up with the rest of the world on rail technology ?
When several countries are operating driverless trains and efficient underground rail system, Nigeria is still struggling to construct surface rail systems .
The coaches here still run on the oldest technology and unfortunately for the country, its President thinks the aim of creating a university is to get people to be employed .
The Texas Central train will soon be transporting riders on the 240-mile trip from Dallas-Fort Worth to Houston in less than 90 minutes, making it the fastest train in North America .
Going by the way we develop in Nigeria, it could take forever for the university to be relevant to the rail business .
Technology will definitely keep evolving and it is almost certain that our leaders won't do what it takes to make the university relevant .
Engaging in high research and experimentation is one of the hallmarks of universities all over the world.
How much budget does Nigeria devote to research in its universities ?
As of today, Africa, as a continent, produces one per cent of research technologies in the world.
Tackling this problem should be of more importance to the giant of Africa than turning universities to a constituency project.
As rightly noted by the African Research Universities Alliance, Africa can't speak about development until it has the capacity to generate its own knowledge.
The rest of the world is concerned about how African universities are preparing students for the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) calling for more doctoral training.
The challenge is lack of innovation and technologies that can solve the continent's problems.
For those who will argue that this is the essence of establishing Transportation University, I challenge them to tell Nigerians where they hope to get the academic staff that will run the university from.
Are they going to be sourced from this current university system that is suffering from dearth of academic staff ?
There are reports of universities renting staff to get their courses accredited by the National Universities Commission .
The NUC cannot claim to be ignorant of this phenomenon.
A lot of lecturers in public universities work in private universities and vice versa .
The NUC, for instance, has a template for the minimum number of PhDs that universities should have in each department, how many Nigerian universities meet this requirement ?
How many universities in Nigeria are producing PhDs on annual basis ?
I know UI produces the highest number of PhDs annually but I doubt if it could produce up to 500 per annum.
The last figure I knew was around 250 per annum.
Honestly, Nigeria should concentrate on building its research capacity and developing innovative curricula that will help its students develop the crucial skills of creativity and critical thinking.
These are some of the things that can make Nigeria relevant in the development space.
China is one of the few countries in the world controlling over 80% of research innovations.
The Federal Government should commit more resources into funding research activities and capacity building.
Universities are not secondary schools.
We don't need this proliferation!
Olabisi Deji-Folutile is a member of the Nigerian Guild of Editors.
My most recent published article, 'Recalling Tai Solarin's prediction', which appeared in the first week of this month, ended with a series of questions .
I reproduce four of them that are most relevant to this sequel: 'Why is it that despite the Nigerian Left's insistence, at least since 1979, on the inevitability and irreducibility of a Revolutionary Party, the party has not emerged?
Why should we find ourselves repeating the same theses and propositions after every bloody and farcical display called 'election'?
How has Nigeria's ruling class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule ?
Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria's ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force ?
The day after the article appeared, a comrade, Wumi Raji, who is a Leftist academic at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, called me on phone .
After the usual pleasantries, he respectfully 'complained' that my article ended abruptly, that he had expected me to answer or begin to answer the questions I posed .
As I was about to suggest a time for us to discuss the answers on phone, he expressed preference for a written response ‚Äì perhaps a sequel to the previous article .
Finally, he 'requested' that the sequel should not take too long in coming .
When he asked what I thought of his 'request' I told him bluntly that I did not understand what he asked me to do as a request, that I understood it as a comradely order which, coming, in particular, from his generation, I could not turn down.
Wumi Raji did not give me any space in our brief telephone conversation to say something that I would have liked to say, namely, that my questions were drafted as open questions to the Nigerian Left.
They were not drafted as an introduction to a 'lecture' which, perhaps, I was preparing to deliver; nor were they rhetorical questions (which demand no answers) nor exam-type questions (which demand answers from entities that exclude the examiner).
In any case, what, practically, should I or could I do now, I asked myself at the end of my discussion with Raji.
The answer, which came a day later, was that I could expand the questions and supply explanatory notes to some of them.
If I perform these minimum tasks well, I would have begun to contribute to discussions leading to answers.
If the four questions I have reproduced here are combined, they translate to a loud and angry regret that since the end of Nigeria's Civil War in 1970 and particularly since the 1979 general elections with which the Second Republic (1979-1983) was inaugurated, a sufficiently strong Leftist Revolutionary Party has not emerged in the country to frontally and seriously challenge the ruling capitalist class.
This serious and frontal challenge would have been either for power or for the dominant political position in the country or, minimally, for a significant shift in the balance of socio-political forces in favour of the working and toiling masses of Nigeria.
This regret about what could have happened‚Äîbut did not, or had not happened‚Äînow translates back to a single question, Why?
In my view, a view shared by many Leftists, the major reasons for the non-emergence of a Revolutionary Party, sufficiently strong to frontally and seriously challenge Nigeria's ruling capitalist class may be broadly separated into two segments: the objective and the subjective.
We may defer the objective reasons.
But of the subjective reasons, the most prominent is what I had described as 'differences within the Nigerian Left' (The Guardian, October 4, 2018).
This important factor will be our focus in the rest of this piece.
It is on account of the differences within the Left that I have insisted, in the last two years, on the production and dissemination of a People's Manifesto.
My reasoning is that in the process of producing and disseminating the People's Manifesto (The Left platform) the differences that many Leftists presume do not exist, or are not serious, will emerge and be engaged.
It is, of course, expected that the Manifesto‚Äîwhich in the process of production and dissemination will begin to resolve our internal differences‚Äîwill first appear as a robust draft document that attempts to take precise positions on some critical questions before the masses and the nation.
The draft may begin with a Preamble or Introduction: Who we are, what we propose to do, the agency of the revolutionary transformation and the social forces of the transformation.
It may then go on to Popular-Democratic Ideas (constitutional and republican democracy, the rule of law, the state and the people, socioeconomic rights, political rights and civil rights).
It may then proceed to Strategy of the Revolutionary Transformation; Democratic Governance; Philosophy of Governance and Principles of State Policy; SocioEconomic Restructuring; The National Question, National Unity and Geo-political Restructuring; National Independence and Foreign Policy.
The document should, of course, end with a Transitional Programme (immediate agenda).
My current position on each of these proposed elements of a Peoples Manifesto has been explicit in my published articles of the past two years.
But a particular sensitive subject‚Äîthe National Question‚Äîrequires further explanatory notes here.
Nigerian Leftists, especially Marxists, know or should know that neither theory nor history has resolved what Marxism knows as the National Question‚Äîfrom the standpoint of Marxism.
Had it been resolved‚Äîeven if badly‚Äîwe could have been more confident to take positions on the tragic things that happened within the leaderships of the ruling communist parties of the former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia and former Czechoslovakia and to the countries and peoples over whom they ruled for decades.
If there were a near-settled Marxist position on the National Question the enduring ethnic question in China (since the 1949 Revolution) would not have remained an embarrassing issue for Marxists and socialists everywhere.
If the history of Marxism had handed us a resolution of the National Question, we would have been bolder in taking positions on what happened between Ethiopian and Eritrean Marxists and Leftists in the last quarter of last century.
And coming home, if we had a near-settled theory or if Marxism had substantially advanced the debate on the National Question since the Russian Revolution and the Third International, Nigerian Marxists would today be bolder to take positions on what happened to the Nigerian Marxist Left during the Nigerian Civil War and on the status of current pro-Biafra Nigerian Marxists.
I do not know how many living Nigerian Marxists followed and still remember the public 'national question' debate between two leading Nigerian Leftist intellectuals: Comrade GG Darah and the late Comrade Yusufu Bala Usman about a decade ago.
Let me end the present piece with the following poser: Before, during and after the Russian Revolution, a Marxist tendency closely connected with Lenin introduced 'national oppression' as a 'Marxist category, related to class oppression but not identical with or subordinate to it'
Whereas in that period, Rosa Luxembourg, who requires no introduction, stood (and still stands) 'at the apex of the attempt to make operational the Marxist concept of class as the primary social referent, and to break once and for all the old alternative stranglehold of nation'.
From this poser I propose that Nigerian Leftists, especially those of Marxist orientation, should advance the debate on the National Question and Geopolitical Restructuring in Nigeria with the twin-objective of arriving at a common position in Nigeria and simultaneously contributing to the further development of Marxism on this question.
This effort will also, simultaneously, advance the process of founding a nationwide Revolutionary Party that is substantial, authoritative and respected.
Torrential rain has destroyed makeshift tents and caused severeflooding to temporary displacement camps in northeast Nigeria, leaving vulnerable families homeless.
In Dikwa, 500 people have been rendered homeless due to flooding and have set up home in disused registration centres .
Large numbers of families, who fled from conflict months ago, are left homeless while others are forced to share overcrowded tents with neighbours or relatives
My home is completely destroyed.
My floor has turned to mud and water is everywhere.
The rain keeps coming and we do not have any choice butto wait for it to stop or share with others,' said displaced mother-of-four Fatima Mohammed (30)
The Adamawa State government, the organization said, had officially declared an outbreak of cholera in three local government areas duringthe rainy season.
The total number of cases reported as of August 16 stands at 633.
Four people have so far lost their lives to the disease.
Due to recent heavy rain and flooding, more cases could be confirmed over the coming weeks, the NRC pointed out .
There are no sanitation or drainage facilities in most camps.
People are going to the toilet in open spaces because there are nofacilities for them to use and now that the camps are filled withstagnant floodwater, water-borne diseases like cholera quicklyspread,' Batonon added.
Meanwhile, the United Nations and partners have appealed for $848million to address the needs in northeast Nigeria this year.
About eight months into the year, less than 40 per cent has been received.
Additional financial support is urgently needed to reach the 6.2million people targeted for humanitarian aid in 2019.
People will die if they don¬¥t receive urgent assistance now,' Batonon said.
Furthermore, heavy rain periods present opportunities by armed groupsto infiltrate and target displacement camps.
On Tuesday night (August 20) in Dikwa, a female suicide bomberdetonated a bomb, killing herself and injuring four civilians.
This was the first attack of its kind in the area since December 2018.
RE: DSS And The 6th December Federal High Court, Abuja Incident By Lucky Ighoyota
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for .
On Saturday, December 7, 24 hours after the debacle at the Federal High Court, Abuja, the Department of State Services prevaricated about the real fact just to offset its damaged reputation.
It is no surprise to us or the general public, who are now used to the DSS' novelties of historical records of numerous lies m intended to create a false or misleading impression.
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for.
After willfully violating two different court orders that granted bail to Omoyele Sowore, and until Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu's 24-hour ultimatum to the operative, it became an obvious fact that the compliance with the court order was with the ulterior motive of releasing and rearresting Sowore, just to be seen to have obeyed the pending court.
During the court proceeding of the day under reference, defence counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), intimated the judge of the intention of the DSS to rearrest Sowore, but it was overlooked.
However, as soon as Sowore was about stepping out of the courtroom, DSS operatives laid hands on him to rearrest him without a charge; hence, the pandemonium between the violent operatives of the DSS and supporters of Sowore who couldn't comprehend the justification for a rearrest barely 24 hours after his release.
Eyewitness and media accounts have it that the DSS operatives stormed the courtroom violently and disrupted proceeding for which the sitting judge, Justice Ojukwu, had to scamper for safety.
In the press release of the DSS, it accused Sowore's supporters of shielding him from an 'imaginary arrest.'
But in reality, the rearrest already proved that it wasn't an imaginary arrest.
Since Sowore's appearances in court over this case with the DSS, armed operatives of the service in the court premises on December 6 were greater in number than ever.
This is to show that Sowore's rearrest was a decision reached by the service even before his release on December 5!
On the claim by the DSS that its operatives were not inside the courtroom to carry out the rearrest, a critical look at the videos in circulation by the media and eyewitnesses revealed that some men of the operatives not dressed in DSS' branded uniform dragging Sowore on the ground inside the courtroom.
One of the service men inside the courtroom to forcefully rearrest Sowore was Marshall. He was not dressed in the branded uniform of the DSS. He was in a black jacket as seen in all videos in circulation.
Marshall was always the DSS operative restraining Sowore from speaking with the press during his previous appearances in court.
Also, it is worthy to note that Sowore while still within the premises of the court told this same Marshall that he was a disgrace.
With this fact alone, it is abundantly clear that after 24 hours of silence over the court debacle by the DSS, in a bid to salvage their publicly damaged reputation, they still couldn't manufacture a 'smart lie' that serves to make amends.
It is unthinkable of the DSS to accuse Sowore of addressing a group of persons at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on the same day of his release of a 'reassured cause' to create anarchy in the country.
This allegation is spurious, bogus, fake, and inauthentic.The DSS intends to make the public think something that is not true.
In other words, the DSS is trying to establish the basis for rearresting Sowore to be that he had violated one of his bail conditions. This is laughable!
It is on record that when the DSS earlier insisted on validating the sureties to Sowore's bail, Justice m Ojukwu asked the counsel to the DSS if the agency was running a parallel court.
Most reasonably now, if a bail condition has been violated, it is of the same court that gave the conditions to determine that. The bail conditions were not by the DSS but by the court.
By DSS' inconsistent actions, the agency has assumed both the role of the court, the law, and the judge in this matter. This is a tragedy and a travesty of justice.
DSS' historical records of numerous lies, human right violations, court contempt, and the recent desecration of the court all speak of one truth, which is, the operative is unabashedly unruly and does not have the genetic composition to abide by the law.
There is no plan by any one group connected to Omoyele Sowore to organise an insurrection in the country.
A wise saying has it that the evil that men do live after them.
DSS' unequivocal reputation for false alarms is a psychological self-defense mechanism to preempt the provocative paranoia their oppressive tendencies are stirring in Nigerians.
The agency is gradually militarising our democracy by its undemocratic actions and terrorising assaults on dissenting
We are requesting well meaning Nigerians to lend their voices to condemn the disobedience against the democratic rights and freedom of expression of our staff.
Also, we are demanding the unconditional release of Omoyele Sowore from illegal detention.
Reactions Trail Genevieve's Lionheart Movie Oscar Disqualification
'Lionheart' is among the 10 African films that were submitted for Oscar consideration this year.
Since this news broke, there have been arguments for and against the decision by Oscar.
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first-ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, 'Lionheart' has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The panel said the movie had 'too much English dialogue'.
The movie which was directed by ace Nollywood actress, GenevieveNnaji, according to the Los Angeles Times ran afoul of the academy rule which states that an International feature film category must have 'a predominantly non-English dialogue track' .
'Lionheart' is among the 10 African films that were submitted for Oscar consideration this year.
This isn't the first time the academy has disqualified a foreign film from consideration for having too much English dialogue
In recent years, the 2015 Afghan film, Utopia, and the 2007 Israeli movie, The Band's Visit, were disqualified for the same reason,' Los AngelesTimes reports.
Since this news broke, there have been arguments for and against the decision by Oscar.
Giving her reaction, an American filmmaker, Ava Duvernay wondered whythe movie was disqualified when the official language of Nigeria was English.
In a tweet on her official Twitter handle she wrote: 'To the academy(Oscar), You disqualified Nigeria's first-ever submission for Best International Feature because its in English.
But English is the official language of Nigeria.
Are you barring this country from evercompeting for an Oscar in its official language?
'In her response to Ava Duvernay's tweet, Genevieve Nnaji said: 'I am the director of Lionheart.
This movie represents the way we speak as Nigerians.
This includes English which acts as a bridge between the500+ languages spoken in our country; thereby making us one Nigeria.
'It's no different to how French connects communities in former Frenchcolonies.
We did not choose who colonized us.
As ever, this film andmany like it is proudly Nigerian.
'For Nigerian actor, Deyemi, he chose to see the positive side, saying:'I can only imagine how many more views Lionheart will have on Netflix by the end of today!
Anyhow you look at it this is a win! Staywinning.
'To think that some Nigerians actually complained that Lionheart had too much Igbo!
Only for the Oscars to think it has too much English?
Total BS!
Honestly, I don't even care for the Oscars at this point!
They might as well change the name back to 'Foreign language',' a Twitter user, Steven Chuks, stated.
Another Twitter user, Britain Danielle, said, 'Something about this doesn't seem fair.
The film was disqualified because it's mostly in English.
Meanwhile, the official language of Nigeria is English.'
Recalling Tai Solarin's Prediction By Edwin Madunagu
Does it mean that nothing has changed fundamentally in Nigeria's social order or in the Leftist challenge to it, or both?
How has Nigeria's ruling capitalist class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule?
Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria's ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?
Nigeria's 2019 elections, particularly the recent governorship contests in Kogi and Bayelsa states, have forcefully brought back a prediction which the late Tai Solarin made about 40 years ago in the aftermath of the 1979 elections.
Of course, recalling this prediction is also recalling my response to it at the time.
I was then 33.
It is appropriate to begin any story I might wish to tell here by introducing Tai Solarin to young Nigerians who were not born when the prediction was made.
This set of Nigerians now constitutes the majority of the Nigerian population.
Tai Solarin was a prominent Nigerian male from South-Western Nigeria who was a secular humanist and educationist, but whose humanism was exceptional because it was all-round (that is, in thought as well as in action), consistent, courageous and well-informed.
Tai Solarin was not a Marxist, not a communist and not a worker by class placement.
But he was a proletarian in lifestyle.
In politics he would be described as a progressive, but not a progressive in the mould of the present-day Nigeria's neofascist 'progressive'.
Tai Solarin was a progressive in the original sense of being located in the Leftist ideological and political universe.
He was, in general, a 'social critic' and, in particular, a critical, popular and respected newspaper columnist.
Now to the beginning of this piece.
We may recall that Nigeria's Second Republic began on October 1, 1979 after a 13-year period (1966-1979) of military rule that witnessed a civil war.
In the general elections that ushered in the Republic, Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) emerged as (Executive) President and Obafemi Awolowo of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) emerged as the second strongest presidential candidate.
The result was, to say the least, very contentious‚Äîas we can recall or research.
But the issue here is neither the contentiousness of the result of the presidential contest nor the side which Tai Solarin supported.
He was a member of the UPN .
Rather, we are concerned with his prediction five weeks into the new Republic.
On November 4, 1979, 34 days after the installation of President Shehu Shagari, the Sunday edition of the Tribune newspaper carried a column by Tai Solarin titled The Stolen Presidency.
In it the columnist wrote: 'If this government lasts four years the four-year-old NPN will have been firmly planted as Government Party everywhere, and the UPN, the GNPP, the NPP and the PRP will have been drained to annihilation, both in membership‚Äîit is already starting‚Äîand in morale.
The 1983 election would therefore be between the NPN and the Revolutionary Party which, having studied how the NPN came to power knows exactly what to do to supplant the NPN for the presidency.
There would then be a confusion on the national raft.
Then commotion among the sharks.
And we, the common people, will have, as victims, paid the supreme sacrifice'.
My comment on this prediction was immediate‚Äîas was expected in those days.
It appeared in an edition of the Nigerian Chronicle, a daily newspaper owned and published by the Cross River State government.
The comment was later revised and included in the text of a lecture I delivered at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in November 1980 under the auspices of the institution's Alliance of Progressive Students (ALPS) on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the killing of Nigerian miners at the Iva Valley Mines, Enugu, by the colonial police.
And later still, in May 1981, the comment was included in a book which emanated from the lecture.
The lecture as well as the book that emanated from it were titled: Human Progress and Its Enemies: The Struggle for a more humane social order in Nigeria.
In the book, I said, 'Tai Solarin's prediction is unusual in two ways.
In the first place, Tai Solarin was predicting the disintegration and demise of his party, the UPN.
In the second place he was predicting that it would require a Revolutionary Party to dislodge the NPN from power: a type of prediction that normally comes from a revolutionary and not a liberal.
We may ignore Tai Solarin's scenario‚Äîfor the Revolutionary Party, when it emerges, will not fight according to the rules fashioned by the enemies of progress.
But we agree completely that the NPN, as a political party, is today the best organization of the Nigerian bourgeoisie and the most accurate reflection of Nigerian bourgeois interests.
So long as the bourgeois social order remains so long will the NPN (or a new monster it may give birth to) continue to be the dominant political organization of the bourgeoisie.'
It follows from above that 'only a revolutionary agency, representing the true aspirations of the popular masses (the workers, the peasants, students, etc.) and fighting consistently for an entirely new social order, can ever dislodge the NPN from power.
To that extent‚Äîand to that extent alone‚Äîwe agree with Tai Solarin.
But we do not share his pessimism.
A revolution cannot be conceived in a pessimistic perspective.
A revolution‚Äîto use the words of Leon Trotsky‚Äîis incompatible with pessimism and other forms of spiritual collapse.
Tai Solarin's pessimism arose from the fact that he made a separation between the people and the Revolutionary Party‚Äîa type of separation that exists between the people and the existing political parties.
A genuine revolution can only be made by the people under the leadership of their revolutionary organization, and such a revolution demands the highest forms of optimism and moral courage.'
Looking now at this nearly 40-year old 'exchange' between Tai Solarin and myself, it strikes me that I could myself not have realized its full import.
Tai Solarin said only a Revolutionary Party could dislodge the NPN from power.
I agreed with him but amended the proposition by replacing 'NPN' with the phrase 'NPN or a new monster it might give birth to'.
This suggests that I had a 'flash' that NPN could be succeeded by another party‚Äîor another entity‚Äîbut nonetheless, a 'monster' (such as a military junta) organically emerging from NPN.
But the 'flash' was not pursued.
It is clear that the class perspective was missing from Tai Solarin's analysis and prediction.
This is explicable, given that he was not a Marxist.
But my response was also not sufficiently ideological.
Let me explain.
In political-ideological contestation, even in our own context, the terms 'bourgeois' and 'capitalist' are not simply interchangeable.
The absence of 'capitalist' in my 'disquisition' qualifies it as petty-bourgeois, even if revolutionary.
If I had adopted a more appropriate ideological posture I would have stated explicitly that what I was alluding to was the removal of the capitalist class, as a class, and not just its political organisations like the NPN.
Having said this, the questions now are: Why is it that for almost 40 years, I have periodically‚Äîafter every major election or change of government‚Äîfelt the way I felt following the 1979 general elections and Tai Solarin's prediction?
Why is it that despite the Nigerian Left's insistence, at least since 1979, on the inevitability and irreducibility of a Revolutionary Party, the party has not emerged?
Why should we find ourselves repeating the same theses and propositions after every bloody and farcical display called 'election'?
Does it mean that nothing has changed fundamentally in Nigeria's social order or in the Leftist challenge to it, or both?
How has Nigeria's ruling capitalist class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule?
Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria's ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?

Reflections On Cold War And Africa's Human Progress By Phumlani Majozi
In contrast to 30 years ago, the world is a better place in consideration of almost all the metrics of human development including economic growth, healthcare, access to education, and human right.
This rate of progress is unprecedented in human history.
My colleague at African Liberty, Alexander Hammond, has done incredible work on global human progress for the Cato Institute.
Unsurprisingly, it's only after the Cold War that we have seen extraordinary advancements in technology and declines in global poverty rates.
But before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world was divided.
While Russia led the Soviet Union on a mission to turn the world into a communist paradise, the United States (US) invested huge resources to stall the Soviet Union's communist ambitions.
The two countries, Russia and the United States, had distinct philosophical worldviews; communism and capitalism.
Because of their differences, they both exploited many resources to advance their ideologies to every corner of the globe.
The clash of these ideologies has resulted in incessant global instability, which negatively affects almost all regions of the world.
Multilateral institutions like the United Nations became an ideological battlefield for the two powers.
In that tumultuous period in human history, none of us benefited; in fact, things became worse for much of the developing world with political dysfunction fuelled, in part, by the Cold War.
Today, sadly, people tend to underestimate the harm that was done by this global ideological standoff that lasted decades.
Could it be due to short memories?
Well, the African continent was one of the Cold War battlegrounds.
My homeland, South Africa, was one of the victims of the Cold War.
One of the reasons why it took us longer to end apartheid was because global powers saw our struggle against apartheid in the Cold War lens; Americans viewed Nelson Mandela as a communist and they believed his outlawed political movement, the African National Congress, was funded by Moscow.
The US and Britain were conflicted about the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, hence, when we talk about the history of South Africa's black struggle against apartheid, we should not isolate it from the dynamics of the Cold War.
The Cold War raged on for years in Zaire ‚Äî now the Democratic Republic of Congo ‚Äî as the country endured crisis after crisis.
The political turmoil that culminated in Patrice Lumumba's brutal death in 1961, usually called the Congo Crisis, was in part, fuelled by the power struggle between Russia and the US.
The corrupt Mobuto Sese Seko who took power in 1965 and ran Zaire to the ground, was supported by the United States for most of his tyrannical rule because he was an ally against the Soviet Union.
The above Cold War cases on South Africa and the DRC, and on many other fronts in Africa, caused enormous political and socioeconomic damage to the continent.
The end of the Cold War put the world in a new, positive direction.
A more cooperative world led by the US.
The results of the formation of this new world were astonishingly a boon for human progress.
Speedy advancements in technology and globalization have cut global poverty to less than ten percent.
Today, most women have the opportunity to go to school, and child mortality has reduced by more than half.
Global healthcare has generally improved.
Equally, experts seem to agree that we now live in the most peaceful times in modern human history.
But it is Africa that still lags behind on fundamental measures of human development in the post-Cold War era.
African countries have failed abysmally to liberalise their economies; they still rank at the bottom of the Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom.
Civil conflicts, dictatorships, and corruption have continued unabated.
Although global poverty rates may have declined since the early 1990s, Africa's rates remain incredibly high compared to other regions of the world.
Having gone through one of its rough periods in history, Africa needs a pro-market revolution.
The revolution needs people that are willing to put their countries first, not their personal interests.
Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, recipient of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, is one of the people we must look up to in moving Africa forward.
The Cold War is now history.
And history is history; there's not much we can do to change it.
All we can do is to learn from it and use it as a guide to a better future.

REPORTER'S DIARY: 'Who Did You Come To See?
' ‚Äî A Visit To The 'Racist' Shi Shi Chinese Restaurant In Lagos
On arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.
'Good afternoon,' we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.
'Who did you come to see ? he queried.
Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: 'Is this not a restaurant?'
The security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.
What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?
SaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.
Our Experience
On arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.
Good afternoon, we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.
Who did you come to see? he queried.
Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: 'Is this not a restaurant?'
The security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.
The team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).
The entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible.
There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather.
We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant.
Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books).
She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants, waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.
In the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us.
We were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area.
As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.
The Wait
As we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea.
By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.
She beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us.
The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording.
I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone.
Sigh.
We continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.
In a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward 'glance lock', 'Camera lady' approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.
Please note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders 'looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms' in the restaurant.
The Show Must Go On
And so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions.
Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks.
A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.
I wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move?
Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes).
As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.
She walked up to us and said 'hello' and stayed there.
A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place.
One member of the team queried if 'everyone is welcome here?
' to which she simply said 'yes'.
She then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?
As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery.
I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building.
How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?
It turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.
More suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.
From our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard's inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google.
There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out.
Would they have done all that if we were Chinese?
In the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception.
Reps Order Repair Of Terminal Receiving Vehicles At Apapa Port
The House instructed the Nigerian Ports Authority to immediately repair the quay wall of the facility and carry out a much needed infrastructural upgrade at the Tin Can port as well.
Daily Trust
The House of Representatives has ordered the repair of the terminal at Apapa port complex in Lagos responsible for receiving vehicles legally imported into the country.
The House instructed the Nigerian Ports Authority to immediately repair the quay wall of the facility and carry out a much needed infrastructural upgrade at the Tin Can port as well.
Sponsor of the bill, Benjamin Bem, said the poor state of the facility was costing the country loses of N600bn annually.
Bem said, 'The House is worried that the collapse of the quay wall (retaining wall) and the apron area of the terminal, which has the length of 438 meters, could lead to closure of the only terminal that receives vehicle cargos from across the world into Nigeria being closed and loss of huge revenue accruable to government and loss of jobs to many Nigerians.'
While noting that the actual operation of the terminals have been privatised, Bem observed that it remains the duty of the ports authority to build and upgrade the infrastructure.
REVEALED: NFF 2nd VP Masterminded Backdoor Inclusion Of DSS DG's Son Into Nigeria's U-17 Squad To Stop Corruption Case Against Him
Sources have revealed how Second Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, masterminded how Bichi's son was smuggled into the final team list submitted by coach Manu Garba to FIFA despite his name not being on the 50 players provisional list.
As the inclusion of Abba Bichi, son of the Director-General of the Department of State Services, in Nigeria's squad for the Golden Eaglets U-17 team in the ongoing FIFA U-17 World Cup continues to generate buzz, more details have emerged how the inclusion of Bichi's son was facilitated.
Sources have revealed how Second Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, masterminded how Bichi's son was smuggled into the final team list submitted by coach Manu Garba to FIFA despite his name not being on the 50 players provisional list.
SaharaReporters had published how top NFF officials coerced Garba into selecting Bichi and even threatened him if he does not give-in to the request.
It was revealed that Garba had expressed doubt in the ability of the young lad to break into the team.
How NFF Smuggled DSS Director General's Son, Abba Bichi, Into U-17 World Cup Team
Also, to accommodate Bichi's son into the team, Garba had to drop one of the regulars in his team.
However, fresh facts have revealed that Dikko hatched and implemented the plan with the support of some NFF officials.
Multiple sources disclosed to SaharaReporters that Dikko came through with the plan to seek favour on his corruption case with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
The ICPC is investigating Dikko and some other executives of the NFF for financial malpractices and diverting funds meant for the association.
The ICPC in September obtained a court order to seal a house belonging to Dikko in Rivers State.
'The inclusion of DSS boss' son was to get favour and goodwill.
Dikko carried out the plan so that he and other NFF executives undergoing investigation by EFCC and ICPC would be free.
'This was perfectly planned out at a time NFF is under intense watch and investigation,' sources said.
NFF President, Amaju Pinnick; First Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi; Dikko; and another executive member, Yusuf 'Fresh', are all facing corruption case in a 17-count charge on misappropriation of $8.4m belonging to the football body.
The NFF executive members had been ordered to appear in court on November 5 2019, which is the next adjourned date for the case.
Meanwhile, the NFF had claimed that Oduko was selected by the coach because of his understanding of the game and skills, countering claims that he was dropped for a fellow teammate.
'Bichi is a striker; Oduko is a left-back.
Oduko was dropped for Charles Etim.
Oduko was the player that lost the kick in the shootout with Guinea in the semifinals of the U17 AFCON in Tanzania, which condemned Eaglets to the third-place match,' said NFF media officer, Demola Olajire.
The Golden Eaglets had played two matches in the ongoing tournament but Bichi is yet to feature in the competition.
Rivers Police Explain Closure Of Port Harcourt-Aba Road Since March 9 Elections
The action was meant to 'protect INEC office situated between Waterlines and GRA bus stops, its personnel and electoral materials in the office'.
The Police Command in Rivers State has said the continuous closure of the Port Harcourt-Aba road leading to the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is in 'public interest'.
DSP Nnamdi Omoni, spokesman of the Rivers Police Command appealed to the residents of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, to show understanding and cooperation.
According to Omoni, the closure was not intended to cause hardship for the residents.
The Waterlines Bus-stop to GRA stop axis of the road has remained closed since the March 9, 2019 governorship and house of assembly polls.
'It is in the interest of Rivers; it is not intended to cause hardship for the residents.
The people should bear with the Command; it is only for a while,' he said, adding that the action was meant to 'protect INEC office situated between Waterlines and GRA bus stops, its personnel and electoral materials in the office'.
Rivers Women To Turn Up At INEC Office Naked ‚Äî Unless Effanga Is Removed As REC
The women threatened that if in the next 48 hours, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), fails to heed to their demand, they would storm INEC's Port Harcourt head office naked.
Thousands of women have taken to the streets of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, to demand the immediate redeployment of the Obo Effanga, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC).
The protesters, dressed in black and drawn from the 23 local government areas of the state, said his continued stay in the state was breeding tension and possible breakdown of law and order.
Carrying placards with various inscriptions, the women threatened that if in the next 48 hours, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), fails to heed to their demand, they would storm INEC's Port Harcourt head office naked.
Protests for and against the INEC REC have intensified in Rivers State in the last three days, with pro-government demonstrators asking that Effanga be retained in the state, whereas the anti-Effanga protesters want his removal, accusing him of compromising the outcome of the March 9 governorship and state house of assembly elections in the state to favour Nyesom Wike, incumbent Governor of Rivers State.
The women are not alone in the call for the removal of Effanga, as some governorship candidates have joined the call.
In a recent article he wrote and circulated, Tonye Cole, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said only the redeployment of Effanga would guarantee conducive atmosphere for free and fair elections in Rivers State.
He called for the outright cancellation of the polls, just as he re-echoed earlier calls by Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the Accord Party candidate, who had described the entire exercise as a 'charade', and Victor Fingesi of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), who said INEC planned the polls to fail.
Ruiz Asks Anthony Joshua For Third Fight After Nigerian Reclaims Heavyweight Titles
It was a masterful performance from AJ in Saudi Arabia; the Nigerian-born British boxer schooled Ruiz from range and never allowed the Mexican-American to close the gap.
Anthony Joshua on Saturday night comprehensively defeated Andy Ruiz Jr 118-110, 118-110, 119-109 in their rematch to regain his IBF, IBO, WBO and WBA (super) heavyweight titles.
It was a masterful performance from AJ in Saudi Arabia; the Nigerian-born British boxer schooled Ruiz from range and never allowed the Mexican-American to close the gap.
Joshua jabbed Ruiz Jr to death and he never gave the champion a chance to get inside and land the nasty hooks that led to AJ's demise the first time around.
After the fight, both men showed their respect for one another and embraced before they did their post-fight interviews, according to talksport.com
When Joshua asked Ruiz if he wanted to retire following calls for AJ to do the same after he lost in New York, Ruiz answered that he wanted a third fight.
Grabbing the mic, he said, 'I want the third fight.'
He then asked the crowd, 'Who wants to see the third fight?
In fact, Ruiz Jr asked the Saudi Arabia crowd several times if they would like to see a third fight between the two men and he seemed to want to do it in Saudi again, too.
Joshua suggested he was well up for it too, declaring, 'If you've heard, we're gonna do a third.'
Ruiz was outclassed on the night and he admits he went into the rematch too heavy, having tipped the scales at more than 20 stone on Friday.
He said, 'It was his night.
I didn't prepare how I should have.
'I gained too much weight.
I don't want to give excuses, he won.
He boxed me around.
'If we do a third fight, I'm going to get in shape.
I'll be in the best shape of my life.
'I thought I was going to feel stronger.
Next fight I'm going to get more prepared.
I tried to train myself for this.
I was chasing him too much.
I was hesitating too much.
Russia Gets Four Year Ban From All Global Sporting Events Over Doping
It means the Russia will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
Russia has been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
It means the Russia will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the BBC reports.
But athletes, who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal, will be able to compete under a neutral flag.
WADA's executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It comes after Russia's Anti-Doping Agency was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
It had to hand over data to WADA as condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.
WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie, said the decision showed its 'determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis'.
He added, 'For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport.
The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada's reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response.
That is exactly what has been delivered.
Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.
Sack DSS DG, Yusuf Bichi, Premium Times Tells Buhari In New Editorial
Evidently, Mr Bichi's DSS has become a major threat to the norms and values of a democratic system.
Premium Times, an independent news platform in Nigeria, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately fire Yusuf Bichi, head of the Department of State Services, over his role in his men's Invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja last Friday to rearrest Omoyele Sowore.
DSS Spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, had initially denied the invasion despite evidence.
The service later backtracked when Bichi sent a delegation to apologise to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court over the incident.
In an editorial on Friday, Premium Times said, The frightening scale of impunity and arbitrary conduct under the presidency of General Muhammadu Buhari plumbed new depths on Friday, December 6 when armed operatives of the State Security Service (often called the Department of State Services ‚Äì DSS), invaded Federal High Court No.
7 in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
We are now at that point where it is being argued that never in the history of Nigeria, including during the colonial period and the dark days of military rule, has such brazen act of disrespect for the sanctity of our law courts and independence of the judiciary been perpetrated.
We are greatly concerned that the DSS under the leadership of Yusuf Bichi has repeatedly acted as if it is above the laws of the land.
The serial violations of the fundamental human rights of the citizens by the security outfit since Mr Bichi assumed the reins of leadership and the disdain with which it has been treating the judicial arm of government through flagrant disobedience of court orders that seek to put a stop to such violations, have indeed become routine.
Dr Okpala said that the disease symptoms include fever, headaches, sore throat, general body weakness, coughing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and chest pains.
He explained that in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nostrils, mouths and other body openings were observed.
Commissioner said the time between the infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease ranges from 3 to 21 days.
He emphasised that early treatment and diagnosis increase the chances of survival.
Dr Okpala explained that people of all age groups, who come in contact with urine, faeces, saliva, and blood of rats, stand higher risk of contracting the disease.
People living in rat-infested environment also have increased chances of coming in contact with rats.
People who consume potentially contaminated food stuff especially those left open overnight or dried outside in the open.
People who handle or process rodents for consumption and those who do not perform hand hygiene when appropriate.
Relatives who care for sick persons with unexplained illnesses at home, doctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions.
Hospital staff that clean, disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear.
He adds: Laboratory staff who handle blood samples of suspected Lassa fever patients, without appropriate precautions, medical or support staff that prepare or handle dead bodies without appropriate precautions can contract the disease'.
To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, he gave the following advice:.
Ensure proper environmental sanitation, i.e.
The ministry is also working toward facilitating the Diaspora Estate and portal, where Ndi Anambra in The Diaspora can register online to ascertain their numeric strength.
keep your environment clean at all times, and block all holes in your houses to prevent rats from entering.
Cover your dustbins and dispose refuse properly.
Communities should set up dump sites very far from their homes to reduce the chances of having rodents within homes.
Store food stuff like rice, garri, beans, corn/maize and the likes in air tight containers.
Avoid drying food stuff outside on the floor and on roadside where it will be exposed to contamination.
Youths of Anambra will undergo training on Project Smart Job' that will make booking of hotel, transportation and other online services, easy and accessible.
He advised Ndi Anambra to avoid bush fires which could lead to displacement of rats from bushes to human dwellings and eliminate rats in homes and communities by setting rat traps.
He enjoined healthcare workers to practice standard precautions at all times, that is, wearing gloves when handling patients or providing care to an ill patient/relative.
Healthcare workers should maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever, be vigilant and look out for symptoms of Lassa fever.
Dr Okpala advised that any febrile illness that has not responded to 48 hours use of anti-malaria or antibiotics should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever.
He also called on the healthcare workers to report any suspected case of Lassa fever to their local government disease surveillance and notification officer to access care.
The commissioner said that Anambra State Ministry of Health was on the alert and fully prepared to respond to any outbreak of Lassa fever in the state.
GOVERNMENT ASSURES OF READINESS TO COMPLETE OKPUNOEZE /UMEOJILIGWE NNEWI ROADS By Mercy Akaolisa/Theresa Muowe :
Anambra State Government has assured the leadership of Uruagu Nnewi Community of its readiness to complete Okpunoeze/Umeojiligwe Uruagu Nnewi roads.
Special Adviser (SA) to the Governor on Budget Monitoring and Efficiency, Mr Melie Onyejepu said this while addressing the group after an inspection tour on ongoing reconstruction of drainage channel of the roads.
Mr Onyejepu expressed the determination of the Gov. Obiano-led administration to ensure that the roads were in good shape, noting that the contractor had since been mobilised back to the site.
The economy of Anambra State is doing well because Gov. Willie Obiano has invested a lot on security, education, good roads, and in other vital areas.
According to him, the roads were delayed because of the prolonged rains, the redesigning of the drainage channel as well as increase in the bearing strength on the pavement.
The SA re-assured them that Government was committed to completing the roads before the next raining season.
The President General, Uruagu Community, Mr Charles Nwoye praised the giant strides of Gov. Obiano.
She said that Anambra was the safest state in Nigeria with accessible good road network.
The PG said that although the community was grateful for the intervention by the state government, but stressed the need to ensure completion of the roads before the rainy season.
A stakeholder in Uruagu Nnewi, Mr Ben Aghazu pledged that the community would offer the construction company the needed support to complete the project.
In my personal capacity, I have provided a place of residence for the workers to ensure their availability in the site.
Aghazu commended Onyejepu efforts in ensuring that the state government intervened in 100-Foot Road, Nnewi.
Another stakeholder of the community, Mr Agu Okonkwo praised the Onyejepu for ensuring that the roads continued to command government's attention.
He also said that the community was worried because the sand earlier coated on the roads was posing health challenges to residents of the community.
ADB TO BANKROLL CONSTRUCTION OF RURAL/FARM ROADS IN ANAMBRA AT PROJECT COST OF 50 MILLION DOLLARS
The African Development Bank (ADB) is to bankroll the construction of rural/farm roads in 14 Local Government Areas of Anambra state at the cost of 50 million dollars, a top aid of the Anambra state Government says.
The Project Coordinator of Anambra Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP), Mr Joe Onyejekwe, an engineer said the project would be sited in some select food producing corridors of the state.
According to him diligent decisions were reached to site the projects within these food producing belts of the state -- Ayamelum, Anambra East, Anambra West, Oyi, Dunukofia, Awka North, Awka, South, Orumba North, Orumba South, Aguata, Ihiala, Ogbaru, Idemili South and Anaocha.
He said the projects were originally conceived by the Federal Government, when it was established that the country was steadily losing 9.8 Billion dollars annually in post harvest losses.
The commissioner said this when the Association of Ndi Anambra residing in Madrid, Spain paid her courtesy visit in her office at the Jerome Udoji Secretariat Complex, Awka.
This stemmed from the inability of the food producing areas to readily access the markets to evacuate their harvests.
He said that the FG, then, opened up discussions with two major funding agencies -- the World Bank and the African Development based in Abidjan.
Onyejekwe, a Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Governor on Works, noted that it was the bid to overcome this anomaly that the FG then, projected to execute the jobs in 18 states.
He said that it was resolved that five states -- Anambra, Borno, Benue, Taraba and Cross River States would be financed by African Development Bank and the rest to be financed by the World Bank.
The ADB has since accepted to bankroll the projects, promising each of the five states 50 million dollars.
Their officials have made two major visits to Anambra State, during which they have interacted with people from the concerned communities.
They have all mutually agreed to work together toward successful realisation of the projects.
Onyejekwe, said that project, which aims primarily at building all-season farm roads would have complementing infrastructure and facilities like building of markets, Veterinary clinics, cottage industries, Road Safety Service centres, Storage facilities.
The benefitting communities benefiting communities would be trained on road maintenance and partnership with the private sector for provision of transport for evacuation of farm produce.
The job would also entail resettlement of people, who might be displaced in the process for project delivery.
He confirmed that Anambra State Government had demonstrated commitment by striving to meet all the local requirements to access the funding for the project.
Since conditions require that all participating states will provide 8 per cent of the counterpart funding, the state has since committed to this.
Indeed, the funding that has so far been utilised by Anambra to carry out its impact assessment studies and other relevant exercises considered important to assessing the project have come from the state Government.
Onyejekwe said that Anambra State Government had so far spent N80 million, all still within the 8 per cent of Anambra State share of the counterpart funding.
We expect another tranche of payment from Government to undertake another critical aspect of the job; this is the design and then full implementation of the project, when the funding must been assessed for full execution of the various jobs.
I am confident that the project will soon get off to a start with all the enormous engineering works in full steam.
The job execution would guarantee jobs at all levels ‚Äì the Bank and communities will be happy at the jobs.
Its going to be a win on win situation for all'.
DOZZY FOUNDATION ENROLLS 1,500 PERSONS INTO ANAMBRA HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME
Dozzy Foundation, a subsidiary of Dozzy Group Nig. Ltd. , has enrolled no fewer than 1,500 Okija indigenes into Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme (ASHIA).
, has enrolled no fewer than 1,500 Okija indigenes into Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme (ASHIA).
The enrollment took place at Okija General Hospital, where some top government officials, business moguls, traditional rulers, clergies and witnessed the event.
Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra, who flagged off the exercise, was represented by his Deputy, Dr Nkem Okeke.
The governor said that the health insurance scheme was introduced to offer medical succour to the low income earners as well as those living in the rural areas of the state.
Obiano commended the Foundation for making free medical care available, noting that the scheme would enable the indigenes especially the elderly ones among them to visit the hospitals regularly.
He said that the enrollees would pay little or no amount in medical bills as the exercise would help to eliminate the spread and use of fake drugs in the communities.
We are here to extend the scheme to Okija through Dozzy Foundation,' he said.
The governor also inaugurated the upgraded Okija General Hospital by Dozzy Foundation.
He thanked the Executive Chairman Dozzy Group, Dr Daniel Chukwudozie for the kind gesture.
The governor, then, urged other well-to-do Ndi Anambra to emulate the group in bringing development to the state.
Executive Secretary ASHIA, Dr Simeon Onyemaechi, said Dozzy Foundation had taken the bull by the horn' in engaging 1,500 persons into the scheme.
We wish to commend them for understanding the need for functional health system,' Onyemaechi said.
The ASHIA boss urged beneficiaries to ensure proper use of the opportunity.
Days of visiting quacks are over and the people of Okija can now access quality healthcare using their ASHIA cards,' Onyemaechi said.
He said that the foundation had taken care of financial aspect of the enrollees as N12, 000 annual fees per person had been paid for all 1,500 individuals.
Dr Onyemaechi also thanked Dozzy Foundation for spending millions of naira in renovating the Okija General Hospital, describing the act as philanthropy at its best'.
Anambra State Government is quite appreciative of the support from Dozzy group through its various interventions in Okija and environs,' he said.
In an address, Executive Chairman Dozzy group, Dr Chukwudozie said the foundation had over the years embarked on programmes aimed at empowering the less privileged.
These includes, offering scholarship to indigent students and putting smiles on faces of the widows.
He said that the Foundation had recognised inability of many people to pay their hospital bills.
This he said compel them to patronise quacks, thereby increasing the mortality rate of people living in most rural communities.
Dr Chukwudozie noted that the inauguration of the scheme in Okija in collaboration with ASHIA was in line with Social Corporate Responsibility of the Dozzy.
He solicited state government assistance in providing medical personnel, as well as equipping Okija General Hospital with necessary basic amenities.
Some of the enrollees expressed their joy, describing the programme as a good development that would help prolong their lives.
CRIMINALISE BUSH FIRES NOW -- LIVESTOCK FARMER
Dr Ugochukwu Okpalaeke, Managing Director (MD) Eagle Food Processing Industry Ltd., has called on government at all levels to criminalise bush fires to save forest reserves in the state.
Those who can afford it should pay without delay for their indigent relatives, friends and community members the way philanthropists like Dr Chukwudozie of Dozzy Foundation have done for their people.
Okpalaeke made the call while interacting with information officers, in his office at Ozalla Akokwa Umuchu, on Jan.
Dr Okpalaeke said that bush fires constituted sabotage against governments at all levels.
This is a matter that should be treated with dispatch.
He explained that that certain people he classed as lazy hunters' were those in the habit of setting fires in a bid to hunt for bush meat' ‚Äìrabbits, antelopes.
According to him in the process they only succeed in destroying forest reserves and their habitats.
When fires destroy bush, the nutrients in the land, animals, birds and insects that cross fertilize plants are also destroyed in the process; this also results into poor harvests of crops, high mortality rate among animals, with hunger as another direct consequence.
So, government has no option than to deal decisively with bush fire perpetrators, so as to stem negative consequences,' he said.
According to him, it is an ill wind that blows no one any good, calling on the media especially radio and television to develop jingles to sensitise the general public on dangers of bush fires.
He urged Churches, Primary/Secondary Schools, market leaders, Igwes, president's generals and village heads to launch crusade against fire menace.
The MD said that since December 2019 to date, he lost nine native cows (Efi Igbo) as a result of bush fires that cleared all vegetations around his ranch.
The Efi Hausa is survives it because they eat prepared animal feeds while Efi Igbo finds it difficult to survive as feed mainly on green leaves,' he said.
Okpalaeke used the opportunity to congratulate Gov. Willie Obiano on his recent award as Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of St. Gregory the Great.
There can hardly be a better demonstration of solidarity with the human family than participation in initiatives like the Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme.
Anambra State Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, Indigenous Artworks, Culture and Tourism, Mrs Sally Mbanefo has appealed Anambra State Association (ASA), Madrid, Spain to strive invest in the state.
This is an honour well deserved and a reward for hard work.
Obiano has achieved excellence at every life endeavour, from his school days to his days in the banking industry/personal businesses.
He called on Anambra youths to emulate Obiano, emphasising that award did not come through shortcuts, but rather from hard work.
If anybody wanted an award of excellence, he should discharge his duties creditably wherever they found themselves.
I have not less 40 awards as a farmer.
So, awards are available in every discipline; it is only hard work and sincerity of purpose that are rewarded,' he said.
The MD emphasised that it was better to rear animals in ranches than rearing them wandering about.
This he said had enabled them to grow faster, bigger and produce more.
Those that purchase cows from us testify to generating more meat as they slaughter them,' Okpalaeke said.
We maintain good relationship with crop farmers because we buy their products such as cassava peels, leaves, to feed our animals.
They also buy animal faeces as manure to grow crops.
Okpalaeke said that they also undertake palm kernel processing for animal feeds, buying as much as anybody could bring to them at attractive prices.
A staff member of Eagle Food Processing Industry Nigeria Ltd.
, Mr Samuel Ezennia said that their MD was a good employer.
He pays salaries promptly; maintains good relationship with workers who are known to be hard working.
He punishes lazy ones.
CONDUCT INTEGRITY TESTS BEFORE REBUILDING -- AGUPUGO URGES VICTIMS OF MARKET FIRE DISASTERS
Executive Director, Anambra State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr CY Agupugo has directed shop owners affected by Mgbuka Obosi Market fire disasters to conduct integrity tests before rebuilding their burnt shops.
Agupugo gave the directive when the panel set up on recent Mgbuka Obosi Market fires conducted assessment visits to affected parts of the market.
The executive director, who doubled as secretary of the panel noted that it was wrong to start rebuilding shops and malls without integrity tests by the State Physical Planning Board and other relevant bodies.
We all have to take proper measures before we commence rebuilding of shops.
I know that we are in a hurry to rebuild, so as to get back to our businesses, but we have to do the right thing first,' he said.
Managing Director Anambra State Fire Service, Mr Ben Chiobi noted that the market was of great relevance to Ndi Anambra, as investors from different parts of the world come there to do business.
According to him, it was of importance that challenges faced by the market be addressed immediately and accordingly.
Chiobi also condemned indiscriminate dumping of waste engine oil and other combustible materials in and around the market.
He said that state government through agencies like fire service, SEMA and related bodies would aid the market leaders to see that state laws would be enforce.
It is in the interest of government to see that whatever challenges they face are solved as the state government will always come to your aid.
In order to avoid future occurrence of disasters in the state, there is a process for erecting buildings and that process requires that you must get government approval,' Chiobi noted.
Chairman of Mgbuka Obosi who is also a member of the panel, Mr Samuel Okey Ezeobodo, while sympathising with the fire victims, commended the state government for showing concerns toward them.
He urged market leadership to ensure that the people put up better structures that would benefit the traders and government.

On June 12, 2018, Joshua Dariye, former Plateau State governor and senator, huddled in the dock awaiting the verdict of fate for pilfering N1.6bn public funds at a high court of the Federal Capital Territory.
Dariye was lachrymal, wiping hot tears from his eyes.
Before the senator was handed a 14-year jail sentence by Adebukola Banjoko, the presiding judge, he begged for mercy ‚Äì a luxury he did not accord to the people of Plateau who endured his troubled administration.
He was found guilty of 14 counts out of the 23 preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
Before the judge passed her judgment, Paul Eroko, counsel to Dariye, pleaded for a light sentence.
'Appeals to your judgement do not succeed; we will fall on your mercy. The prisons are congested,' Eroko said.
'They misled the governor, it is the bank; they said he didn't have to present anything.'
But Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to the EFCC, said Dariye did not deserve a light sentence because he 'did not show remorse'.
At this point, weeping Dariye said he wanted to speak.
'Have mercy, you are a Christian, your name is Jacob,' he said.
On Thursday, Orji Uzor Kalu, another former governor and senator, received the retribution of kismet.
Reality jarred Kalu out of the fantasy that he was going home to his bed after his conviction for money laundering by a federal high court in Lagos.
After Mohammad Idris, the presiding judge, pronounced a 12-year jail sentence and warders moved towards him with handcuffs, the Senate Chief Whip resorted to diplomacy.
'Where are you taking us to now? Please don't handcuff me. I will follow you,' he said.
Kalu's fall is louder than the crash of Jericho ‚Äì being a trenchant mouthpiece of President Muhammadu Buhari in the South-East.
But is his conviction a 'pass mark' for Buhari's much vaunted war against corruption? I do not think so.
First, the case is 12 years old. It was not actuated by this administration. And investigations were already concluded before this regime.
Second, corruption cases recently initiated against certain individuals have not received oomph owing to the fact that they are in the 'Buhari fraternity'.
For example, the case of Babachir Lawal, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, is sputtering in court this despite his indictment by the government he served.
Also, there is a petition against Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC, for alleged money laundering at the EFCC. Tinubu admitted transporting cash in bullion vans on the eve of the 2019 election to his house. But the anti-graft agency has not moved a muscle to investigate the allegation.
When Ibrahim Magu, acting EFCC chairman, was asked about the petition against Jagaban by a journalist, he snubbed the inquiry, and said 'next question, please?'
As a matter of fact, there are other members of the APC and those in the Buhari fraternity who have corruption allegations hanging on their necks, but the EFCC is yet to crack up a case against them.
I will not mention more names.
So, on what grounds should Buhari's anti-corruption war be toasted? If the regime is applauded for the jailing of Dariye and Orji Kalu, how about other cases it has failed to take up or conclude?
The fact is, Buhari's anti-corruption war is still selective. And as Abubakar Tsav, former Lagos police commissioner, said, 'It has no impact on Nigerians.'
However, I will commend the judiciary for not bending despite influences to have some cases of corruption compromised. The termination of Kalu's 12-year-old bout at the trial court is a big point for the institution. The hero here is this arm of government.
But beyond this feat, we must look into another tragic offence against Nigerians. Why is a senator convicted of fraud still receiving allowances and salaries as a member of the Senate?
As of December 2018, Dariye was paid N85.5m in prison, and as of May 2019 his allowances had risen to N171m. Obviously, the same immoral privilege will be accorded to Orji Kalu. Is this not troubling?
What it means is that tax-payers will continue to fund the lifestyles of individuals who have been convicted of stealing from them.
Justice is not final when people, who have been declared vandals of the public purse, are still maintained by public money.

Arsenal Sacks Emery Over Poor Performance
During his time at the club, he oversaw a disastrous run of form that saw his side go seven games without a win for the first time since 1992.
Unai Emery, has been sacked as manager of Arsenal.
During his time at the club, he oversaw a disastrous run of form that saw his side go seven games without a win for the first time since 1992.
Hailed in the past as saviour of the team, Emery, 48, was appointed in the summer of 2018 following the departure of Arsene Wenger.
He guided the Gunners to fifth in his debut campaign, one point adrift of Spurs, before losing 4-1 to Chelsea in the Europa League final.
His side also went 22 games unbeaten combined with a run of 11 straight defeats.
The final straw was the Europa League defeat at home to Frankfurt on Thursday.
The club have asked Freddie Ljungberg to take responsibility for the first team as interim head coach.
ASUU Calls For Boycott As Varsites Begin IPPIS Today
The union said the Federal Government needs to test its own model of ensuring financial transparency rather than forcing its members captured on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, which opened on Monday.
The leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has directed its members nationwide to disregard a circular from the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to enrol academic staff on the Integrated Payment and Personnel Information System from Monday.
ASUU on Sunday stated that the same Accountant-General of the Federation had challenged the union to develop a template that accommodates the peculiarities of academic staff and present same to him.
The union said the Federal Government needs to test its own model of ensuring financial transparency rather than forcing its members captured on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, which opened on Monday, a report by PUNCH said.
Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, ASUU National President, added that the enrollment of lecturers was like taking universities back to core civil service.
Ogunyemi insisted that its members will not take part in the registration for the IPPIS, adding that such steps by the Federal Government would undermine the autonomy of Nigerian universities.
He said, 'We have proposed to the government that we have an alternative that will address all issues that the government had raised about universities.
The government needs to test our own model rather than buying into a model that will take universities back to the core civil service.
With IPPIS, before a Vice Chancellor can employ an academic worker, the VC will have to get permission from the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.
'Universities cannot be run within the framework of civil service bureaucracy.
'Universities are universal cities of knowledge creation and they can perform best when they are allowed to operate their system based on the laws establishing them.
'We signed a memorandum of action with government earlier this year and they promised that they will start visitation by March this year.
Government didn't do anything.
This is November.
When people say ASUU is encouraging corruption, it is cheap blackmail.
'We will destroy Nigerian universities with IPPIS if government should go ahead and force people to enroll.
'You can't bring lecturers from all over the world and ask them to go and register in Abuja in the ministry.
It is ridiculous.
We have gone beyond that.
They are taking us many decades back.
It is sad.'
Banking Sector's Loss Is Entertainment Industry's Gain
The entertainment industry is emerging as the market that will absorbmuch of the loans the central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is forcingcommercial banks to give.
A report by Proshare indicates that banks are positioning themselves to attract clients from small and medium scale enterprises in themusic and movie space.
However, analysts Sahara Reporters have spoken to and reports published by financial research firms, conclude that the increasedpressure on banks to lend much of their deposit, is negative for thefinance industry at this point.
We believe this development ‚Äî the 65 percent loan to deposit ratio islargely negative for the banking sector, which has only just recoveredfrom the weak asset quality issues prevalent since 2016,'Cardinalstone research said in a report.
We also believe that the macro-environment is still too fragile tosupport strong growth in lending,' it added.
Adedayo Bakare, an analyst with Afrinvest gave Sahara Reporters a similar outlook.
True to Bakare's observation, two of the three-tier 1 lenders, Zenith and Guarantee Trust, are among the 12 lenders fined a combined total of over N499bn by the CBN for their inability to meet with the September 2019 target of borrowing 60 percent of their deposits to thereal sector.
The third lender ‚Äì Access bank, survived thanks to thehuge loan portfolio it inherited from Tier 2 Diamond bank.
Proshare is of the opinion that these lenders have looked to thesafety of the celebrity industry, to reduce the risk of borrowingfunds to the everyday farmer and small-time shoemaker.
In a report published Thursday, it listed a series of creative packages Deposit Money Banks are adapting to build quality assets in the creative space.
The most audacious plan is Access bank's Creative Arts village in Ogun State.
Proshare notes that the village will help to 'address issueslike the location for movie production, capacity building forpractitioners, and deepening the ecosystem of the Arts and Entertainment industry in Nigeria.
Herbert Wigwe, the managing director of Access Bank, expects thevillage to create 2 to 3m jobs annually.
The size of Access bank's investment in Ogun State is indicative of the feeling in the industry.
One of such strategies is the United Bank of Africa (UBA's) decision to make Wizkid its ambassador.
It had also hosted a discourse 'Stars and Suits: Afropop meets HighFinance,' that conference gave UBA the opportunity to build acollaboration between music stars and finance institutions.
Zenith, ECOBank and GT are other banks that have and are building more partnerships with clientele in the creative industry.
Banky W Attacks Buhari's Government For Arresting Sowore
Who go represent you?
When they enter office, they will get what they paid for.
Na double wahala for everybody.'
Musician, Bankole Wellington better known as Banky W, has condemned the Nigerian Government for its gross human rights violation against citizens.
He also accused Nigerians of being too complacent in moments when they should act.
Banky W made his position known in a music video posted on his Instagram page with hashtag #BetterChallenge.
He said, 'You see the story is the same old one, you want change but you won't vote?
Then complaining is a not the thing.
The video went on to show CCTV footage of Sowore's arrest by operatives of the Department of State Services in Lagos on August 3.
He added, 'They arrest protestor and protect dishonourable senators.
Who be the meat, who be the hunter?
Too many days for the thief, one day for the owner.
They arrest the Protestor, and protect dishonourable Senators.

BBNaija: Khafi Threatens To Sue The Sun Over 'Damaging' Publication
The Sun had on Tuesday reported that Khafi, who is a PC with the Metropolitan Police, had been denied permission by the organisation to participate in the reality show.
The management of Khafi Kareem, a Big Brother Naija constant, has threatened to sue The Sun, a British tabloid, over what it considers 'repulsive and damaging publication' about her.
This was contained in a statement released via Khafi's Instagram page.
Khafi, currently in the Big Brother reality TV show, became popular with viewers for her relationship and sexual activities with another housemate, Gedoni.
The Sun had on Tuesday reported that Khafi, who is a PC with the Metropolitan Police, had been denied permission by the organisation to participate in the reality show.
However, reacting to the report, Khafi's management said it is considering a legal option against the British tabloid except it publicly apologises and retract the now-viral report.
The statement read: 'The attention of Khafi's management has been drawn to a publication by The Sun UK on Tuesday, August 13, 2019, titled 'LOIN OF DUTY Met Police poster girl faces sack for 'having sex' on Nigerian Big Brother after being told not to take part'.
The brazen sensational and defamatory outburst by The Sun UK is written in poor taste without considering the ethics of journalism which seeks balance and objectivity.
At no time did The Sun UK send a mail of inquiry to Khafi's official email which is blasted across her social media platforms under active management to confirm or refute the claims in the publication.
Khafi's side of the story is deliberately and conveniently omitted to sell a pre-conceived narrative while responses from 'outraged colleagues' and 'other papers' riddle the publication.
This comes from a repressive culture of shaming and characterising women for their sexual decisions and life choices.
We find The Sun UK's publication repulsive and damaging to the image and livelihood of our client.
We demand an immediate retraction of the publication by The Sun UK and a public apology to our client Khafilat Kareem within the next 48 hours.
Legal options are also being considered at this time.
BBNaija Is Satanic, Says Muslim Group, Urges Christians To Join In Condemning Reality Show
The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has urged the federal government to immediately place a ban on the Big Brother Naija show.
MURIC posited that the reality show promotes immorality in the country branding it as 'immoral, dangerous and Bohemian'.
Professor Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC also said the promoter of the show must be held accountable for promoting immorality in the country
'We are being forcibly dragged to a world of nudity, shamelessness and open promiscuity.
Inmates of BBNaija kiss, romance and engage in sex openly.
BBNaija is Bohemian, anti-social, crude and immoral.
It constitutes a potent danger to every home.
BBNaija is Satanic.
It is unacceptable.
'Where are our norms and values?
Is it part of African culture to engage in sex in the open?
Where are the authorities?
Is the Ministry of Information and Culture sleeping?
Is the National Orientation Agency on sabbatical?
Who will protect our children from this despicable onslaught?
Who did this to Nigeria?
This reality show is dragging our children into a life of moral debauchery.
It is robbing them of the last vestiges of honour.
It is deleting the word 'shame' from their vocabulary.
BBNaija has alienated our youth from the elders.
A yawning lacuna now exists between the young and the old.
Irreversible social crisis looms.
We must see those who woo our young ones with humongous amounts of money, big cars, and palatial buildings as those bent on destroying industry, diligence, and integrity, particularly among the youth.
Nothing destroys a nation faster than materialism.
The daughters of Jezebel are here already.
Unless the authorities move with the speed of lightning, human dignity in Nigeria is going, going, going!
Or do we not realize that for every single BBNaija inmate who wins a big amount of money and a car, more than 50 million young people are misled?
Qur'an 30:41 says, 'Evil has appeared on both land and sea as a result of the handiworks of men'
The Bible in Ephesians 4:19 was also describing these people when it says, 'Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more'.
MURIC calls for unity among the Christians and Muslims in the country to jointly condemn and force the government to place a ban on the reality show.
MURIC Gives Falz Seven Days To Withdraw 'This Is Nigeria'
We can put an end to this anomaly called BBNaija if Christians and Muslims bury the hatchet and come together to fight evil.
Home is home.
Moral debauchery knows no religion.
The destructive influence of television shows like BBNaija penetrates both Christian and Muslim homes.
Ditto for the custodians of our culture and tradition.
Our traditional rulers ignore a program like this, which has all the potentials to diminish the dignity of our culture.
They are fighting over who should be chairman of the council of traditional rulers.
They want to be the king of kings and rivals of the supreme creator.
Who placed a curse on Nigeria?
Homo sapiens may not respect a single snake when they see one.
But can anyone wait to see what follows if the cobra leads and it is faithfully followed by the python, the black mamba, rattlesnake, garter snake, and the anaconda?
So what do you think will happen if our traditional rulers from the East, West and North march on Aso Rock to demand the immediate halt of this horrible show?
MURIC charged the Ministry of Information and Culture to move swiftly against BBNaija before moral debauchery becomes Nigeria's middle name.
Big Brother Naija: Nigerian-born British Policewoman, Khafi Kareem, Faces Being Sacked After 'Sex Romp' With Another Contestant
The officer was used as a 'poster girl' for the Met, posing alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to encourage black and female recruitment and celebrate 100 years of women in the force.
A British policewoman faces the sack for defying her bosses to appear a reality television programme - before appearing to sleep with a man on the show.
PC Khafi Kareem, 29, from the Metropolitan Police, was warned not to take part in Nigerian Big Brother this year.
But she was granted unpaid leave and entered the show, in which she has formed a relationship with fellow contestant Ekpata Gedoni, 31, the Sun reported.
Audiences in Nigeria have been caught up in their liaisons, of which there has been three, but she will now be the subject of an investigation by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards.
And her colleagues have expressed their dismay at her 'tarnishing' the force's reputation with her antics.
The officer was used as a 'poster girl' for the Met, posing alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to encourage black and female recruitment and celebrate 100 years of women in the force.
One colleague told the Sun: 'She's a serving British police officer - it's outrageous.
She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.
Her out-of-office email reply blatantly says that she is away from work, yet no one does anything.
Other officers working with her are furious that she can just disobey orders then swan off Africa and tarnish the reputation of the force.
Ms. Kareem began as a PC at Lambeth station in 2015 after four years spent as a part-time special constable.
The officer, who has spoken against stop-and-search, joined up after a 16-year-old friend was stabbed to death, UK Daily Mail reports.
The PC worked as a spotter at airports, looking for possible victims of female genital mutilation (FGM).
She also acted as a translator as she speaks French, Italian and her native Yoruba.
However, she wasmoved from the FGM team after she argued with colleagues.
Publicity material for the programme showed Miss Kareem in her uniform, branding her a talented singer and dancer.
The material says of Miss Kareem: 'Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself.
She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good.'
Her romance with Mr. Gedoni has been gripping viewers of the show, which began on June 30.
Nigerian news websites published footage of the couple appearing to be in an act of congress beneath the sheets.
One article said: 'There are now fears that Khafi may leave Big Brother Naija House pregnant as she and lovebird Gedoni continued their sizzling romance.
The cameras caught them for the third time overnight as other housemates were dead asleep.
The footage, now trending, showed the lovebirds moving their bodies in ecstasy under the sheets. Gedoni and Khafi first romped in the house on Saturday, July 20 and then again on Tuesday, July 23.'
Her participation has left her fellow officers unimpressed.
Another Met source told the Sun: 'There should be no way back for her from this and her superiors will have to act.
She fitted the mould perfectly for how the modern force wants to portray itself but seems to have got a bit too big for her boots.
It's hard to see how can she argue that she hasn't brought the force into disrepute.
A Met spokesman said last night: The Met does not support the officer's appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show.
All officers have a duty to behave with professionalism and in a manner that does not bring the Met into disrepute whether on or off duty. Those who do not behave professionally risk breaching police standards of professional behaviour, and may be dealt with by way of misconduct proceedings.'
Big Brother Naija: Sex Content On Reality Show Contemptible, Says Women Council
A new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes. We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture.
The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) and the Nigerian government have condemned the sexual content on Big Brother Naija (BBN), a reality TV show, stating that it is not a Nigerian culture.
Segun Runsewe, Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), said this while receiving Gloria Shoda, President of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS).
The NCAC boss also revealed that the government was in talks with Startimes to start a state-owned BBN that will truly reflect Nigerian content.
He also warned that the agency would present a nudity bill to punish sexual acts as displayed on BBN.
He said: 'We are going to re-present that bill.
You can't fight a battle without a legal framework; we are definitely going to be conscious of that.
I will take up the issue of Big Brother Naija.
I have spoken with officials of the National Broadcasting Commission because what is going on now is terrible.
Having love affairs on the screen is not part of our own culture at all.
Let me use this forum to tell Nigerians that a new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes.
We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture.
We are already working on it, all that will be eaten there will be Nigerian food, the dresses will be Nigerian dresses.'
The NCWS president said she was not against the BBN reality show but the sex content was disgusting.
Shoda said, 'Having live sex on stage is the thing affecting my sensibility and it is impacting negatively on the young children coming up.
Does it mean that they can't abstain from sex for three months?
I'm condemning the sex content on BBN.'
Big Brother Naija Star, Khaffy, Facing UK Met Police Internal Inquiry For Joining Show Without Permission
She's a serving British police officer ‚Äî it's outrageous.
She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.'
A Metropolitan Police officer, Khafi Kareem, is appearing on the Nigerian version of Big Brother despite being refused permission by her bosses and could face disciplinary action.
Ms. Kareem, 29, who was pictured alongside Commissioner Cressida Dick as the Met celebrated 100 years of women in the force last November, is one of the stars of the African reality TV show.
Scotland Yard said it had not granted Ms. Kareem's request to appear on the programme and that an internal investigation would be carried out, reports UK Press Association.
The UK Metropolitan Police said Ms. Kareem was granted unpaid leave for an 'unrelated reason' ahead of appearing on the show but her request to take part in the programme was denied.
A spokesman said: 'A Pc, attached to the Met's transformation command, requested permission to take part in a reality television entertainment show in Nigeria.
Permission was not given.
The Met is aware that the officer has since appeared on the show without authority.
The Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed and will be carrying out an investigation into the circumstances.
'The Met does not support the officer's appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show.'
The force added that any officer found to have breached police standards of professional behaviour could face misconduct proceedings.
According to The Sun, Ms. Kareem joined the force as a Pc based at Lambeth station in 2015, having worked part-time as a special constable for four years.
An unnamed colleague told the newspaper: 'She's a serving British police officer ‚Äî it's outrageous.
She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.'
A post on the website of Africa Magic, the television channel which broadcasts Big Brother Naija, says Ms. Kareem joined the show 'so that she can do societal good'.
It read: 'Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself.
'She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good.
'What people don't know about her is that she is secretly talented in spoken word, singing, and dancing.
She is an Ekiti native who resides in London.'
The post also reveals Ms. Kareem would spend the prize money, reportedly worth N30 million (¬£68,000), on hosting a travel show in Nigeria, as well as investing in charitable causes.
Bigamy: ASD Daughter's Marriage, Mulan and Abubakar Musa Abubakar By Dr Muhammad Bashir Maru
We must not forget the reverberating cry of Ernesto Che Guevera to with 'If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine' it is this that spur true patriots on an eternal vigil as the vanguards for justice and equity for all.
Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.' ‚Äì Benjamin Franklin
From the very origins and cradle of humanity, injustice has always reared its ugly head to crush and oppress those perceived to be of less social standing and thus the fight for justice has raged on through the ages.
Little wonder the immortal words of Benjamin Franklin remain as empirically practicable today as it was decades ago when he muttered them and even before the words found life from his oscillating tongue centuries back.
These pricking words are the prods that guide us today as we cry out for impartial justice for Abubakar Musa Abubakar who is being persecuted consistently by Alhaji Sani Dauda (ASD), former Chairman of Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited.
In the Nigeria of yesteryears opulent individual like ASD lorded over others like a czar of a medieval fiefdom; having their wishes, whims and caprices foisted on the generality of the people.
This was indeed a dark and gloomy period when he and his ilk had their words as laws and any attempt to challenge or oppose their ambition would be seen as a sacrilege with a resultant mobilization of their foot soldiers to bully, coarse, harass, intimidate and humiliate those who dared to oppose them.
In these repugnant dark days, it was believed that some rogue law enforcement agents, compromised media influencers and corrupt judges were whispered to be on his payroll and always willing to do his bidding.
It can thus be inferred that was the very reason his types got away with so much impunity.
Though the businessman still wallows in the euphoria of the past, but what he has failed to realize is that the ground has shifted beneath him, and that in the New Nigeria of today no one is above the law.
In the lines of the ancient adage, 'A leopard never changes its spots' and so true for ASD's apparent impunity which has remerged in this recent episode hence the resort to contempt of Court and judicial abuse all in a bid to placate his daughter Nasiba Sani Dauda, shield his Son Shehu Sani Dauda, a sharia court Judge Alkali Murtala Nasir Al-Misiry and one Abdullahi Kaloma.
Together, they jointly committed criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence, criminal assault, wrongful confinement and restraint, false imprisonment, voluntary causing of harm, enticement of a married woman, bigamy, re-marriage with concealment of former marriage in defiance of an existing judgment of the Kawo Upper Sharia Court, Kaduna in a case between Abubakar Musa Abubakar Vs. Nasiba Sani Dauda contrary to sections 45, 46, 58, 217, 229, 230, 239, 365, 366 and 369 respectively of the panel code law of Kaduna State, Nigeria.
As one would expect that his recent entanglement with Abubakar Musa Abubakar a supposed son-in-law is nothing new and certainly he is not likely going to be the last person to undergo such a harrowing experience from irresponsible prying except the businessman is stopped in his tracks by the grilling mechanism of justice.
Now, the same scenario is being re-enacted with Abubakar Musa Abubakar, who married Nasiba Sani Dauda on the 24th December, 2016.
It will be recalled that the marriage started on the foundation of love, peace and harmony until few months into the marriage when the father of Nasiba - Alhaji Sani Dauda - began undue interference in the family affairs of the couple on a daily basis and subsequently instructed his daughter against her will to abscond from the marriage for reasons not yet clear to discerning minds.
All entreaties to ASD to return Nasiba to her matrimonial home fell on deaf ears, but he instead forced Nasiba to institute a case of Khul' (request for divorce) before Grade 1 Sharia Court, Tudun Wada, Kaduna where a controversial judgment was obtained and a dissolution of the marriage was pronounced without recourse to principles of nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem to the concerned parties.
However, Abubakar Musa Abubakar not satisfied with the judgment of the lower court obtained a stay of execution order from the Upper Sharia Court, Kawo, Kaduna which was served on the respondent and subsequently appealed the travesty of justice of the lower court at the Upper Sharia Court which gave judgment in favour Abubakar Musa Abubakar by quashing and setting aside the judgment of the lower court for lacks of jurisdiction.
Both the stay of execution order notice and the substantive judgment of the Upper Sharia Court were properly served on the respondent (Nasiba). It is the only prevailing judgment that exists till this day.
The arrest and detention of Alhaji Sani Dauda and others for abetment of an offence, remarriage with marriage concealment, criminal assault among other charges goes further to show that President Muhammadu Buhari's next level agenda will not tolerate lawlessness from any quarters and that justice is truly blind but fair and balanced to all manner of people.
The action of ASD is capable of triggering series of unpleasant events such breach to peace, chaos, turmoil etc.
Above all it is an affront to the judiciary, rule of law and attempt to denigrate sharia law.
How can anyone who called himself Muslim marry off another man's wife?
In condemning the injustice and high handedness being propelled by ASD, let this turn of justice signal a warning knell to all that;
Gone are the days when individuals because of their economic powers can do as they wish by pocketing law enforcement officers and conniving with rogues members of the judiciary to do as they please.
His arrest and detention has sent an unmistakable warning to unrepentant law breakers that there is now a new Sherriff in town and that their excesses will no longer be tolerated.
All eyes are now on the judiciary on whether they will look the other way while the temple of justice is being desecrated through repeated abuse of judicial processes and contempt of Court proceedings.
Since the outbreak of this imbroglio and its escalation in the public domain, ASD albeit clandestinely has been sponsoring groups and individuals as face-saving measures to sell false narratives through media propaganda that portray him and his darling daughter as the victims rather than the perpetrators of this heinous crime against God and humanity.
One of such groups is Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State Chapter, an organisation that should be neutral in a matter that involves two contending parties both of who are Muslims or at best side with the truth but instead they came out disgracefully to pitch tent with the culprits (ASD and Others) who intentionally and knowingly desecrate Islamic Sharia laid down tenets of marriage by abetting bigamy.
By this act, MULAN Kaduna State chapter has shown that their conscience is available for auction to the highest bidder
How low can an organization sink that prides itself as noble?
Abubakar Musa Abubakar should be applauded by all and sundry for towing the path of honour in seeking redress and restraining his relations, associates and thousands of followers from taking laws into their hand and for his abiding faith in our country's judicial system.
Abubakar has never been accused of any wrong doing and he is well known as an honest, hardworking and unassuming gentleman who cannot even hurt a fly.
In the face of provocation, intimidation, emotional hurt, blackmail, unwarranted media attack, defamation, criminal assault to relatives and threat to life among others, Abubakar Musa Abubakar has remained unmoved and consistently determined to get justice via the constitutionally guaranteed means.
Let's hope that at the end of it all, justice will be served impartially, because anything other than that will be equal to encouraging self-help, stamping of lawlessness and an unequivocal invitation to disorderliness.
A society that gives justice to only selected few is a fertile ground for anarchy.
Let those who have ears take a heed.
We must not forget the reverberating cry of Ernesto Che Guevera to wit 'If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine'
It is this that spur true patriots on an eternal vigil as the vanguards for justice and equity for all.
Bill To Give More Money To Lawmakers Passes Second Reading
The zonal intervention funds used in executing constituency projects by the lawmakers has been marred with cases of corruption.
Many of the projects are shoddily executed or abandoned.
In some cases, lawmakers use the items to boost their campaigns.
Nigerian lawmakers are in the process of passing a bill that will allocate more money to them for constituency projects.
The zonal intervention funds used in executing constituency projects by the lawmakers has been marred with cases of corruption.
Many of the projects are shoddily executed or abandoned.
In some cases, lawmakers use the items to boost their campaigns.
However, at the plenary on Tuesday, lawmakers passed a bill seeking to allocate 20 per cent of the national budget for constituency projects.
According to Premium Times, the bill was sponsored by Stella Odua, lawmaker representing Anambra North.
This bill comes on the heels of the outcry over non-existent and incomplete constituency projects proposed by lawmakers.
Nigerian lawmakers have been accused of using constituency projects as a means of embezzling public funds.
Only recently, President Muhammadu Buhari said billions of naira allocated to constituency projects had not been properly utilised ‚Äì an allegation that the Senate Minority Leader dismissed as erroneous.
According to the bill, projects under the Act when passed shall be community-based in order to ensure that the prospective benefits are available to a wide cross-section of the inhabitants of a particular area.
It also states that any funding under the Act shall be for a completed project or a defined phase of a project and may include the acquisition of land and buildings.
'All projects shall be projects as defined under this Act when passed and may include costs related to feasibility studies, planning and design or other technical input for the project but shall not include recurrent costs of a facility.
'Projects may include the acquisition of vehicles, machinery and other equipment for the constituency,' are some provisions of the bill.
Leading the debate, Oduah said constituency projects is one of the unique features of Nigeria's democratic journey so far.
She said the bill is intended to correct the top-bottom approach of governance and replace it with the bottom-top approach.
If not for the projects, the majority of federal constituencies would not have a single federal project due to the lopsided nature of project allocation in the budget, she said.
In his contribution, Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, said there are lots of misinterpretations and misinformation on constituency projects hence the need to act in a manner that gives every constituency a sense of belonging and a national feeling.
He said, 'I think it is only very fair to ensure that every part of this country has that sense of belonging, those little interventions as democratic dividends.'
Bobrisky Is Risky, Buhari Regime Warns Travellers, Tourists
The health hazard Bobrisky has is worse than Ebola Virus Disease; travellers and tourists should be careful wherever they notice the presence of Bobrisky, mostly as it affects sharing of public facilities.
The President Muhammadu regime has warned tourists and travellers to be wary of Nigerian crossdresser, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, aka Bobrisky.
Reacting to a complaint that Bobrisky used a female restroom at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Nigeria's Director-General of National Centre for Arts and Culture, Segun Runsewe, told Punch, 'Bobrisky is a serious health hazard for Nigeria and Nigerians. The health hazard Bobrisky has is worse than Ebola Virus Disease; travellers and tourists should be careful wherever they notice the presence of Bobrisky, mostly as it affects sharing of public facilities.
'Women are prone to get various types of disease from the toilet than sexual intercourse. Now, Bobrisky will enter the same toilet with a woman and at the end the woman will contract some kind of diseases.
'When she gets home and sleeps with her husband and the husband discovers he has been infected, the next thing is to seek for divorce without knowing the actual cause of how the wife was infected.'
Speaking further, he said, 'In the first place, Bobrisky's passport shows that he is a man. Why should he turn himself to a woman and use women's toilets? At the end of the day, innocent Nigerian women who go to same toilet will now be infected with what they did not bargain for.
'If Bobrisky is even using men's toilet, we can understand. As I speak, we got a report of how a woman was very upset with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria because on this day she saw Bobrisky using female toilet in Abuja airport.
'Well, for me, we have done our little bit; we have left everything for the medical practitioners.'
Bobrisky: 'He', 'She', Nigerians Confused About Pronoun To Use For Idris Okuneye
Bobrisky's birthday venue was sealed off on Saturday when policemen laid siege to it.
Nigerians seem confused about the appropriate pronoun to use for Idris Okuneye, a popular cross-dresser and self-acclaimed transgender.
Bobrisky's birthday venue was sealed off on Saturday when policemen laid siege to it.
SaharaReporters reports that Nigerians on social media were divided onthe legality of the police's action.
While some criticized the police for violating Bobrisky's right to assemble, others thought Okuneye's action was immoral.
But, the pronoun to use in describing Bobrisky's gender generated adebate online.
Bisi Alimi, a gay man and advocate for the LGBTQ rights cautioned that the right pronoun for Bobrisky is 'she' and 'her'.
Using this will help reduce stigma and show that you really care.
Similarly, Sarah Ogunmiyiwa with the Twitter handle, @sara_ogun, corrected another Twitter user, Olusegun Iselaiye @10tama22, for using'his' to describe Bobrisky.
Bobrisky on the run as Police Storms.
Shutdown venue if his 27th birthday celebration in Lekki, chase away everyone,'
Iselaiye tweeted to which Ogunmuyiwa replied, 'HER!!! Her pronouns are she/her!!!
In one viral video, Bobrisky asked, 'Who is you bro?'
In an attempt to get Nigerians to see her as a woman.
Border Closure: Nigeria's Inflation Dropped Despite Measure, Says National Bureau Of Statistics
According to the bureau, the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of oils and fats, meat, bread and cereals, potatoes, yam, and other tubers and fish.
Nigeria Cameroon border
Nigeria's inflation rate has dropped by 0.06 in the last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.
According to the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate dropped from 11.08 percent in July to 11.02 percent in August.
The NBS said that the drop in inflation rate continued in August despite several pronouncements regarding restrictions on the import of some food items, minimum wage, and the recent border closures.
Similarly, food inflation dropped to 13.17% from 13.39%, while core inflation dropped to 8.68% from 8.80% recorded in the previous month.
With respect to the impact of border closure on consumer prices, the bureau stated that the country may not see the significant effect on inflation now as the closure was only captured for 11 days during the 31 days reference period in August.
According to the bureau, the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of oils and fats, meat, bread and cereals, potatoes, yam, and other tubers and fish.
On a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 1.22% in August 2019, down by 0.04% points from 1.26% recorded in July 2019.
Boris Johnson Wins Parliamentary Majority
The exit poll spells disaster for the main opposition Labour Party, which was projected to win just 191 seats ‚Äì its worst result since 1935.
British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has won a parliamentary majority following an election to determine the next phase of Brexit.
According to Sky News and BBC on Friday, the results show that the Tories won 326 of the 650 seats in the lower House of Commons, meaning they could not be beaten.
Exit polls from Thursday's vote indicated they could win 368 seats.
If confirmed, this would be the party's biggest majority in three decades.
By contrast, the exit poll spells disaster for the main opposition Labour Party, which was projected to win just 191 seats ‚Äì its worst result since 1935.
On Friday, European leaders are expected to charge EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, with negotiating a close trade deal with Britain.

Brazen Invasion Of Court By DSS And Lagos State Task Force: Suggestions For The Bar By Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa
Unless we act swiftly and urgently now, there seems to be more ahead in the coming days.
I commend the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association for its prompt response to the court invasion by the DSS.
The statement issued is very encouraging and timely indeed.
That is what is expected, given that the main objective of the NBA is to promote the rule of law.
I suggest the following further steps:
1. A meeting with the CJN and AGF to consult on possible steps to be taken to protect judges and the courts from further invasion.
As it was happening in Abuja, so also was it happening in the Federal High Court in Lagos where it was reported that members of the Lagos State Environmental Task Force stormed the court and even stabbed an officer of the court.
The purpose of this meeting is to secure the courts with a functional police post as is done in the National Assembly and even houses of assembly of the states.
2. To ensure that the DSS is made to account for the events of December 6, 2019.
3. To also meet with the leadership of the National Assembly, the committees on judiciary and human rights and law enforcement with a view to getting the DSS to be brought to book.
4. To demand the immediate disengagement of the present leadership of the DSS and all its officers involved in the invasion.
5. To meet with the AG of Lagos State to unravel the invasion of Lagos court and bring those involved to book.
6. To visit CJ of Federal High Court and Hon Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu for solidarity and consultations.
Henceforth, let the NBA get its members involved in any government to be held accountable for any breach of the rule of law by the government and its officers and agencies.
In any state where there is glaring disobedience of the order of court or brazen infraction of the constitution, the AG of that state should be referred to the LPDC and if he's a SAN, also to the LPPC.
The same should happen to the AGF when it involves the Federal Government and its agencies.
Then the counsel involved in such cases for the government should be held accountable by the NBA and the bar generally and be suspended forthwith.
Unless we act swiftly and urgently now, there seems to be more ahead in the coming days.

Liverpool, Barcelona, Juventus Record Remarkable Wins As Arsenal's Misery Continues
For example, in the widely followed English Premier League, table toppers ‚Äì Liverpool ‚Äì fought a resilient Crystal Palace team to walk away 2-1 winners at the end of 90 minutes to keep their title hopes alive.
In major European football league matches played on Saturday, spectators and viewers around the world including in Nigeria were treated to all sorts of experience ‚Äì good, bad and ugly.
For example, in the widely followed English Premier League, table toppers ‚Äì Liverpool ‚Äì fought a resilient Crystal Palace team to walk away 2-1 winners at the end of 90 minutes to keep their title hopes alive.
Goals from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino delivered the maximum points for Jurgen Klopp' side after Wilfried Zaha had scored an equaliser late in the second half.
In other parts of England, Leicester City where Nigeria's Wilfred Ndidi is an integral member of the team, thrashed Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 courtesy of goals from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy.
But it was a different story for Arsenal Football Club of London as their troubles on the pitch continued on Saturday after they were held to a draw at home by Southampton.
The result could have been worse for Unai Emery's side had the visitors converted all their chances inside the 18-yard box.
It took the artistry of Alexandre Lacazette late in extra-time to score the equalising goal for Arsenal and grab a point for them.
Following the team's poor performance in recent times, Emery had come under intense pressure with many of the fans already losing faith in him and his ability to deliver long-awaited success after the departure of Arsene Wenger last season.
In Spain and Italy, Barcelona and Juventus both ground out important wins away from home against Laganes and Atalanta respectively despite strong resistance from their opponents.
Goals from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 win over the host team while a double from Gonzalo Higuain and one from Paulo Dybala saw Juventus come from behind to emerge victorious.
Most top sides in Europe's biggest football leagues were all busy on Saturday as a result of the resumption of the Champions League and Europa League between Tuesday and Thursday.

Man Who Staged Wedding Without Reception Reveals How He Convinced Family To Support Idea
Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Yusuf, said that the decision was one of the biggest he ever took in his life.
A new groom, Adewale Yusuf, who recently shocked many Nigerians by indicating on his wedding invitation card that there would be no reception after the ceremony, has told SaharaReporters that it took him only two calls to convince his parents and other family members to buy into his idea.
Though he said it was initially tough to persuade his bride, Blessing, to support the concept, he eventually won her over after a few debates on the issue.
The new couple trended last weekend on the social media with many Nigerians applauding and also bashing their decision not to hold a reception for their guests.
Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Yusuf, said that the decision was one of the biggest he ever took in his life.
He said, 'When I first informed my parents of the idea not to have a reception after my wedding ceremony, they dropped the call on me.
Eventually, it took me about two more calls to be able to convince them to support my idea.
The truth is that I'm a man of my words. I'm a different person, I am not a loud type.
Many people around me did not like the idea initially but I made sure to let them see reasons with me.
At the end of the day, everyone appreciated my idea.'
But despite not staging a reception at their wedding, Yusuf told SaharaReporters that many of their guests didn't return home without having something to eat.
He added, 'We shared food for the few friends we invited. I made sure my friends that came from Ibadan went back that day.
'One thing people should know is that there is nothing they want that they can't do as long as it makes them happy and fulfilled.
'Having a loud reception after the wedding ceremony was unnecessary as far as I was concerned.'

Ministerial Clutching At Straws By Barnabas Igho
For now, let him know that his take-off was very bad and turbulent and everything boils down to his poor piloting skills, and not the army of imaginary saboteurs and enemies his aides are busy conjuring up for him.
If you are supervising an important ministry like that of communication even without the recent fancy addition of 'digital economy' to its name, and you still need a spokesperson to pen almost 2,000 words of polemics in order to project your image, then your self-inflicted trouble is just starting in my reckoning.
Before her latest outburst in the media, thoughtlessly blaming imaginary saboteurs for trying to stop her 'unstoppable boss', Uwa Suleman had issued a disconcerting diatribe in form of a press release, accusing all critical stakeholders of the ministry her principal supervises including the media, of ganging up against him because he was the 'best thing' that happened to the industry since its liberalisation in the year 2000.
This prompted ripostes of some respected columnists like Mr Sanya Oni of The Nation newspaper, who eloquently summed up the minister's tragedy as a case of exaggerated notion of the office that he occupies as 'he obviously didn't think that his remit stops at formulating and implementing policies for the digital economy; as he wants to play the regulator'.
Since his assuming office in August this year, Mr Pantami has indeed found it difficult to adjust from the regulatory role he used to enjoy at National Information Technology Development Agency to his new titular position as per regulating the industry is concerned, and his unconstitutional attempts to dabble into it has invited the resistance of major actors in the industry like Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria as well as that of the Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria.
Coming back to Uwa's latest invectives however, there are some fundamental half-truths she raised in her slay-queen styled article, like ridiculous claim that South Africa and other countries are busy copying and pasting the minister's example of his failed data price reduction directive.
While this, to say the least, is very disrespectful to the authorities in South Africa, who have never impliedly referred to Nigeria in taking their decisions, it's obviously not the actual representation of the truth of the matter.
Someone should wake Uwa up and hand over a mug of coffee to her together with the contrasting news of India's example that hiked data prices to as much as 40 per cent.
We don't know how this is ignored as a copy and pasting of what the policy of the man she obsequiously describes in ludicrous adjectives that late Idi Amin of Uganda would have rejected.
To cut the story short, India used to enjoy the cheapest data in the world, but the industry could no longer sustain it without risking losing in further investment to support the telecom infrastructure in the country.
This still happened within the 21-day coincidence Uwa claimed to have provided the copy and paste effect in South Africa.
Still, what Uwa hasn't told us was that South Africa used to be among the top three in terms of the cost of data and even with 50 per cent reduction, it wouldn't come down to the level of Nigeria despite the fact that the challenges the telcos face and cost of production in Nigeria are clearly on a different scale.
Even on the strength of TheCable report that Pantami quoted in the past, it put Nigeria and South Africa, with the average of $2.22 and $7.19 per 1GB respectively.
And one can forgive Uwa for her poor grasp of the issue as she embarrassingly attributed the directive in South Africa to the country's telecom regulator, while a little search on Google on the matter would have told her that the decision emanated from South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority, not the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the decision must have been scientifically based, not jejune subjective populist directive.
But such kinds of faux pas are understandable as Uwa and co in the new mandate are trying to learn the rope.
And they should be reminded of the fact that before their arrival on the scene, the industry had already matured.
There were over 70 million Nigerians on the high-speed Internet, millions of active subscriber base as well as numerous sensational story in the industry, which has been on this sustained trajectory for long.
Hence, accusing both the providers and regulator of connivance is not only reckless but cheap as both the stakeholders collaboratively built the industry from the scratch.
Some years ago, we saw how the regulator, NCC fined a major MNO over N1trn. Pray what kind of compromised regulator would dare?
It's not too late for the minister however, to curb himself of this seduction to 'populism' and court the important stakeholders of the ministry by beginning to put the cart before the horse ‚Äì addressing industry issues ‚Äì if he wants to succeed.
Omobola Johnson was very effective as a minster because she fully understood the job and how to manage a delicate industry like telecommunications.
If Mr Pantami wants to succeed, he needs all the regulators and operators on his side, and he can't achieve that by constantly pitching them against the consumers thereby making his narcissistic self-good and everybody that has contributed to the development of the industry bad.
For now, let him know that his take-off was very bad and turbulent and everything boils down to his poor piloting skills, and not the army of imaginary saboteurs and enemies his aides are busy conjuring up for him.

Mob Sets Suspected Ritualist Ablaze In Delta
The man was caught with a human skull and other items in his possession.
There was pandemonium on Thursday at the Otokutu Bridge in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State following the arrest of a middle-aged man suspected to be a ritualist.
The man was caught with a human skull and other items in his possession.
The suspected ritualist, who was said to have been caught by the vigilante group in the area, was set ablaze by an angry mob few minutes after his arrest.
The incident, it was learnt, caused gridlock on the popular DSC Expressway as commuters and vehicle owners making use of that route spent several hours on top of the bridge.
Narrating the incident to our correspondent, a lady who witnessed the scenario, said the suspect had been acting like a deranged person around the bridge for the past months before he was discovered on Thursday when he tried to attack a motorcycle rider.
The woman said, 'The ritualist who has been pretending to be a mad man for several months was about to attack and kill an Okada man who went close to the Otokutu Bridge when he was discovered.
'But as God will have it, the Okada rider escaped from the ritualist and he went to town and informed youths in the area.
On getting to the place, the mob saw the mad man making a call with a phone and upon sighting the people, he immediately threw the phone into a nearby river. The youths and the vigilante conducted a search and a human skull suspected to be that of a lady and other handsets were found with him.
'Upon questioning him, he confessed to belonging to a notorious ritualist gang but declined to give more details and at this point, a mob poured him fuel and set him ablaze.'
It was gathered that despite the presence of policemen at the scene, the mob succeeded in setting ablaze the suspected ritualist.'
Calls and messages to the spokesperson for the police in the state, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, were not responded to.
Monkey Chants, Racist Abuse Make Players Abandon English FA Match
The incident during the match in the fourth qualifying round came just five days after England players endured racist abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia.
An FA Cup qualifying match between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town was abandoned on Saturday after allegations that players were racially abused and spat on.
The players of seventh-tier outfit Haringey walked off the field with about 25 minutes to go, shortly after Yeovil had scored a penalty.
The incident during the match in the fourth qualifying round came just five days after England players endured racist abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia.
Haringey manager Tom Loizou said defender Coby Rowe suffered racial abuse while Cameroonian goalkeeper Douglas Pajetat was also spat at, prompting him to take his players off the pitch.
'Early into the second half, we got a corner and a couple of the players said to me there was monkey chants,' Loizou told Sky News.
'We got over that, we carried on playing. They got a penalty and my goalkeeper was spat at and had missiles thrown at him.
'The referee halted the game briefly, they scored the penalty, one of players went to pick the ball out of the back of the net and Coby Rowe was racially abused.'
Loizou said he had to take his players off.
'I looked at a couple of our players' faces and I was distraught myself, just to see their faces.
I gave it a couple of minutes and I went on the pitch and pulled my players off,' he said.
'There was no way that two or three of those players could have continued playing.
What they heard was disgusting, they looked frightened.
'I can't sit down and watch young players being abused by a minority.'
Rowe later posted on Twitter: 'Can't believe I'm tweeting this and it's 2019 but today I was a victim of racism, in what was supposed to be a great day for @HaringeyBoroFC.
Another game of football ruined by racists.'
Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the 'swift and decisive action' taken by Loizou and his players.
The FA said it was looking into the incident 'as a matter of urgency'.
In a statement, Yeovil said: 'We are aware that there are allegations that racist comments were made in the crowd and this allegation will be a key part of any investigation.
'Irrespective of the outcome of any investigations, we would like to make it clear that the club will not accept racism or discrimination in any form.'
England players endured monkey chants and apparent Nazi salutes in Bulgaria.
That match was stopped twice as England players made their feelings known to UEFA officials before the tie was eventually completed.
Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings, who made his international debut that night and was singled out by the Bulgarian crowd, applauded Haringey for 'taking a stance' against racism.
'Sometimes it can get brushed off in lower leagues but everyone stands with you,' he tweeted. 'Our country isn't perfect either.'

My Generation Too Weak, Cowardly To Fight For Nigeria, Says Don Jazzy
He said, 'I believe my generation has been weak and almost equally at fault for the state Nigeria is in today.
Musician and producer, Don Jazzy, has blamed youths across Nigeria for failing to fight for a better country and accepting the status quo.
In a post on Twitter on Thursday, the record label owner said he wondered why young Nigerians were reluctant to take up positions of leadership to change the fortunes of the country.
He said, 'I believe my generation has been weak and almost equally at fault for the state Nigeria is in today.
'We have been too weak and cowardly to challenge our fathers at the age they built the courage and decided to fight theirs.

Mystery, Controversy Over ABU Student's Suicide By Ibrahim Adeyemi
She (Aisha's mother) has always loved her daughter and she feels she's old enough to know what she wants.
Religion has nothing, I mean nothing, to do with this.
Aishat's mother had nothing to do with Aishat converting from this to that.
The mom has no problem with Aisha being a Muslim.
Her mother has never interfered in it, her friend said.
Aisha Omolola
Dead or alive?
Repressed and depressed by parents or not?
These are the controversial queries that filled the social media airwaves after the mysterious suicide action taken by Aisha Omolola, a 300 level student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in her apartment at Samaru, Kaduna State.
Omolola was said to have committed suicide by drinking insecticide.
She also reportedly dropped a note, stating why she took her life.
According to the note, she wrote that her family should be held responsible for her suicide, especially her mother and father.
She said the duo made life miserable for her and thus, killing herself was the only way she could save herself from the family's frustration.
The letter reads below:
Just like I said, if I am no more, please hold my family especially my mum and dad responsible.
I have tried to be the best I can be, stayed away from them just because they blame me for their mistakes and they can't love, help and take care of me like their own.
My mum has made life a living hell for me only because she is bipolar and frustrated; accusing me of being a witch, trying to kill her and being a cursed child even though my brother is responsible for my education and upkeep.
The only thing she helps me with is my feeding money.
I have gone out of my way to take care of my mum by giving her food and money but I still end up being her problem.
My brother can't stick to his promise anymore because he feels I am not his responsibility and I have my own family.
I hope and believe that now that I am gone, it will bring them relief and happiness.
I am so sorry Collins, I had to leave you this way, Maryam Olayemi you have [been] more than a bestie to me.
I am also sorry to all my friends and well wishers, I love to be happy but I'm nothing but a broken child.
I don't believe in God anymore, cos I can't see my purpose anymore.
I love you all so much.
When the news of the ABU student's suicide made headlines, most Nigerians condemned the act.
However, there are still some questions surrounding her demise left unanswered.
Did Aisha Survive the Suicide Mission?
Few days after reactions followed Aisha's suicide action, it went viral on social media that she survived the attempt to commit suicide.
The source of the rumour is traceable to the post on the Facebook page of Ahmadu Bello University, Samaru, Zaria.
The post, which has more than a thousand shares and likes have made many Nigerians wonder whether she really survived her suicide mission.
However, the picture attached to the Facebook post, showing Aisha in the hospital receiving treatment is the first fact that falsifies the rumours.
This is because the said picture was posted on Twitter sometime in October 2018, when Aisha was said to have had an accident.
The rumour was further falsified by eye-witnesses who witnessed how Aisha died and was buried.
Audu Abdulqudus, a recent graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and close friend to Aisha affirmed that he was among many others who were present at her funeral on the same day she committed suicide.
I was the main friend that carried her dead body the very day she died at the Jamaa hospital in Samaru.
I and her [best friend's father], Mr AbdulGaniu with two policemen took her to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital mortuary.
I was called by Maryam Salami, Aisha's childhood friend on Thursday evening towards 4:00pm.
So, it was Maryam that now told me about the mum telling her that they were at the mortuary and they wanted to go and bury her that very evening on Thursday.
When contacted, Maryam Salami, a childhood friend of Aisha confirmed the death of her bosom friend, adding that Aisha's death was mysterious.
We don't know what to say.
That's how God planned her own death; let's just put it that way,' she said.
Also, one Ruth Omole who was at Samaru hospital where Aisha gave up the ghost affirmed that Aisha did not survive the incident.
What to Note on the Suicide Note
The note left by Aisha about the cause of her suicide has created lots of controversies; there seems some mysterious issues thematically in the note.
The impression generally created in the letter was that Aisha's parents frustrated and repressed her so much that they made her 'not to believe in God anymore', most especially her mother.
As indicated in the note, Aisha frowned at how her mother so much rejected and dejected her while she was alive.
According to the note, she (her mother) would blame her for everything and even called her a witch.
Though all efforts to reach any of her parents proved abortive, the deceased's childhood friend, Maryam Salami, first confirmed that Aisha was the original author of the letter.
Aisha wrote that letter.
That's her handwriting,' she affirmed.
She, however, added that the interpretation of the note could best be conveyed by its author.
Half of what she said could be true and could not be true.
It's a personal issue and we should leave it personal.
In that letter, she said something that has to do with herself and her mother or people around her.
We shouldn't interfere.
That letter said a lot.
I know what that letter means, but I don't want to say anything.
That letter should just be left.
That letter is nothing.
People should just let bygone be bygone.
We should just pray for her and God should forgive all of us, she said.
Were religious differences ever a barrier between Aisha and her parents?
Salami said religion could not have been the apple of discord.
This is contrary to what has been widely spread on social media.

The legal document also notes that ‚Äúthe Commission reserves the right to amend and review this Determination at any time, as well as to consider other options to incentivise the communications industry,‚Äù and not the ministry.
It further states that such a review may be necessitated by major change in the market conditions and/or the underlining principles of this Determination.
In the formulation of this Determination, it was gathered that the banks had applied to the NCC for USSD codes for their mobile transactions, where they were now directed to the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) independently.
Meanwhile, ALTON‚Äôs accounts of how the USSD usage by the banks began and the support of the Commission in allowing the banks to use the USSD platform to facilitate digital financial inclusion is also revealing in the document obtained by The Guardian.
According to ALTON, while telecommunication services and infrastructure became more accessible in the country, the banks identified the USSD channel as a cost-efficient way of delivering financial services to their customers.
‚ÄúThe banks subsequently applied for and were granted USSD shortcodes to deliver financial services to bank customers by the Nigerian Communications Commission (‚Äúthe Commission‚Äù).
‚Äò‚ÄòAt the nascent stage of USSD development for the financial services sector, the billing mode adopted by our members was to charge the telecommunications service consumer directly, which is referred to as end-user billing.
Green House won the track events while White House won in football match.
However, ‚Äúfollowing complaints by its customers with regard to disappearing/illegal airtime deductions, ALTON said there was a consensus with the banks to implement corporate billing where the banks absorbed the costs associated with deploying the USSD platform for financial services.
Calisthenics and match past added glamour to the ceremony.
These are according to a letter obtained from the Ministry, which was dated October 28, 201 and addressed to the Minister Pantami and duly signed by ALTON Chairman and Executive Secretary, Gbenga Adebayo, and Kazeem Ladepo respectively.
