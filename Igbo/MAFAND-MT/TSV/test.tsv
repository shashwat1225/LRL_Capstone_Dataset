They believe that their dreads is their crown.	Ha nwere nkwenye na isi dada ha bụ okpueze ha.
As they believe, a child with dreads will do wonderfully well in life because his God is strongly by him, they are quite strong, and they grow to be brave that cause terror in time of war.

In his words, 'Dada' is a Yoruba term for dreads.	N'ọnụ okwu ya: 'Dada bụ aha ndị yoruba nyere ya.
That the Igbos revere dreads is because they have had contact with the Yorubas.	Ndị Igbo na-asọ isi dada bụ maka a ha na ndị Yoruba enweela mmekọrịta.'

However, this causes confusion in different families. 	Ka o sila dị, nke a na-etinyekarị ezinaụlọ dị iche iche na gbagharịa.
Because of this bad condition, many villages in Igbo land, made it a law that a man will marry the corpse of a woman whom he was living with him without paying the complete dowry	N'ihi ajọ ọnọdụ a, ụfọdụ obodo dị n'ala Igbo, mere ya ka ọ bụrụ iwu na nwoke ga-alụ nwaanyị ya na ya bi n'ozu, bụ nke ọ na-emeghị mgbe ọ dị ndụ.

Like an expert in culture, Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (Duruagwu the second) of Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State, told BBC Igbo, this law is very potent in their village, it goes different punishments.

When he was ruling as a soldier, Buhari was not known for respecting human right.	Dịka mgbe ọ na-achị dịka onyeagha, Buhari enweghị ezigbote aha banyere ikike diri onye.
Despite that we are in democracy, many people are in prison because Buhari did not agree to release them as the court decided.	Agbanyeghi na-anọ n'ọchịchi onye kwuo uche ya, ọtụtụ mmadụ nọ na mkpọrọ maka Buhari ekweghị ịtụhapụ ha dịka ụlọikpe sị ka eme.

He promised to defeat Boko Haram in the war Nigeria fights against the sect that wants an Islamic state in Northern Nigeria, but presently, this sect torments this intention of Buhari through its invasion of this area.

Prominent individuals believe that Buhari will face strong contest with a more prominent non-ruling. The flag bearer of PDP, Atiku Abubakar is also an Islam from Northern Nigeria like Buhari.
