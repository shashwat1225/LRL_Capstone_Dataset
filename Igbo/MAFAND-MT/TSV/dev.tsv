Then, ice fish was called different names to humiliate it such as 'fish corpse by the Igbos, Lagos corpse by the Yorubas, walking corpse by the Ibibios.

In 2014, when the government spoke through the former minister of Agriculture Akinwumi Adesina that they want to ban people from eating cow skin.

A cancer specialist in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr Remi Ajekigbe said that many Nigerians are suffering from cancer because they no longer eat our local foods like garri, yam that has fibre rather they eat foreign foods.
