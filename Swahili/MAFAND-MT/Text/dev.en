The video shares images of the protests that took place in the South West of the country earlier in April.
Indigenous, Afro-Colombian, and farming communities are staging mass protests around Colombia against President Ivan Duque's National Development Plan.
The plan comprises an array of directives that, among other things, will encourage foreign investment in large-scale mining and agribusiness which could threaten indigenous territories.
In March 2019, indigenous communities shut down a major highway in the Cauca region for 25 days.
On April 25, they were joined by other social movements in leading a national strike.
Besides threats to indigenous rights, strikers have protested against budgets cuts in education and the slow implementation of the 2016 Peace Accords of which Duque, who's still to complete a year in office, is an outspoken critic.
Indigenous peoples have referred to the demonstrations as mingas, a Quechua word meaning collective work widely used in protest movements in South America.
#NationalStrike | Indigenous communities, farmers, and afros of Tado, are mobilizing from the early hours of the morning all along the highway from Pereira to Quibdo as part of the National Strike #It'sWorthItToProtest
The National Development Plan includes reforms in different sectors, such as education, energy, and agriculture.
While Duque claims the programs will lift 3,4 million Colombians out of poverty, critics counter that it benefits primarily private corporations.
Indigenous minga leaders are particularly concerned with the aspects of the plan that might challenge their right to prior consultation on development projects on their territories.
While the government has agreed to negotiate with indigenous leaders about the plan, a final agreement is yet to be reached.
According to the newspaper El Espectador, the amount of land the government is willing to protect on behalf of indigenous peoples are way below of what the communities demand:
The difference between what Iván Duque's government offers and what the indigenous communities are asking for in order to open the Panamericana highway is abysmal.
The President talks about 1,500 hectares to resolve the needs of all the organizations that make up the minga, whereas the requirements of the organizations that are protesting is 40,000 hectares.
Peace accords
Signed between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest guerrilla group, the 2016 Peace Accords ended the country's five-decade internal conflict by proclaiming a definitive ceasefire in exchange for participation by former FARC members in institutional politics.
The Peace Accords have also created protections to prevent the accumulation of land by individuals and foreign companies in rural areas.
It prioritized land redistribution and designated a few areas for indigenous, Afro-Colombian, and farming communities who have been severely affected by the long conflict.
Unequal land ownership in rural areas was a major reason why FARC group took up arms in the 1960s.
However, full implementation of the agreement has remained elusive as many conservative sectors in Colombia are staunchly against those terms.
Meanwhile, smaller armed groups remain active in the countryside, where they have staged deadly disputes for control over FARC's former territories.
As a consequence, the number of killed social leaders in rural areas has skyrocketed since the Accords signature.
While figures vary depending on how a social leader is defined, the Colombian ombudsman's office says 460 social leaders have been killed between 2016 and March 31, 2019.
Duque, along with his main ally, former President Álvaro Uribe, is among the most prominent detractors of the peace agreement.
In recent months, he has attempted to weaken the authority of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) a judicial body created by the Accords to try both guerrilla and government actors suspected of war crimes.
Many groups are outraged at those measures, which they say could undermine the chances of true reconciliation.
People shared their reasons for joining the April 25 strike with the hashtag #VamosAlParoPor (We Are Going to Strike For) and #MingaNacionalPorLaVida (National Minga For Life).
We are going to strike for the indigenous minga, because we demand protection to social leaders, former fighters, in support of the JEP and the implementation of the peace accords.
For better labor conditions for teachers and workers centrals.
La Pulla, a YouTube channel of political commentary, delved into the growing tension in a video titled This is What Happens when a Government Ignores its People), where they examine the long history of government neglect in the countryside, particularly the departments of Cauca, Nariño, La Guajira, and Catatumbo.
The journalist states:
The minga reminds us that it is not the only place where people live with unfulfilled (promises), with the government flicking them off every time it can.
We see four regions of the country that the state ignores completely.
No definite solution has been given to the minga's and strikers demands, so protests are likely to continue in the coming months.

[Creative Commons (CC BY-NC 2.0)/ Flickr, January 20, 2007]When they awoke on April 28, ready to cast their ballots in Benin's parliamentary election, voters could not rely on WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate with one another, or to seek information about where to vote.
These and several other major web platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Viber, went dark in the early hours of the day.
By 11 am, 99.5 percent of internet connections became inactive, sending the West African country into a nationwide internet shutdown that lasted well into the night.
Human rights groups and election monitors were dismayed but not shocked by the outage, which appears to have been orchestrated by the sitting government.
New electoral laws pushed by the incumbent administration of President Patrice Talon have re-oriented politics in Benin, which until this year had multiple political parties competing with one another.
But under new policies that raise the threshold for party participation in elections, only two political parties made the cut to put up candidates for parliamentary election.
Both parties are closely aligned with the president.
In the lead-up to the election, a series of public protests which took place despite a blanket ban on street protests were dispersed by law enforcement officials, who used tear gas and batons to break up demonstrations.
Amnesty International reported that multiple political opposition leaders were arrested during demonstrations.
Open web activists at the Media Foundation for West Africa, Internet Sans Frontieres, CIPESA, Access Now, Global Voices (sub-Saharan Africa) and other groups condemned the shutdown in a joint statement:
The UN Human Rights Committee, the official interpreter of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, emphasizes in General Comment no.34 that restrictions on speech online must be strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose.
[7] Shutdowns, by contrast, disproportionately impact all users, and unnecessarily restrict access to information and emergency services communications during crucial moments.
Shutdowns are neither necessary to, nor effective at, achieving a legitimate aim, as they often spread confusion and encourage more people to join public demonstrations.
We respectfully call on you to:
Ensure that social media is restored
Publicly declare your commitment to keep the internet on, and to notify the public of any disruptions
Encourage telecommunications and internet services providers to respect human rights through public disclosures on policies and practices impacting users.
Speaking with Internet Sans Frontieres, Beninese writer and activist Mylène Flicka of Irawo media noted:
Shutting down the Internet on election day only adds suspicion to an already flawed electoral process.
Benin is now performing very poorly in terms of democracy.
All internet connections had been restored as of the morning of April 29, at which point voting had concluded.
#AllForJan demonstration in memory of murdered journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová in Bratislava, 2 March 2018.

Businessman Marián Kočner has been charged with ordering the killing of journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová in 2018, according to a March 15 announcement by Slovakia's Special Prosecutions Office.
Before he was killed, Kuciak was working with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and his outlet, Aktuality.sk, to investigate possible links between an Italian criminal group and its presence in Slovakia.
He also wrote about the business dealings of Kočner.
The murders caused widespread shock in the country.
Demands for justice led to massive protests which forced the resignation of then Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Kuciak was the real target while Kušnírová was killed for simply being in their house when the killers barged in.
They were both 27 years old and had planned to marry in May 2018.
According to the prosecution, Kočner personally threatened Kuciak by phone in September 2017 and then ordered the murder that took place on 21 February 2018 in the village of Veľká Mača.
Slovak law enforcement initially detained four people for the killing of Kuciak and Kušnírová.
Kočner's assistant Alena Zsuzsová was accused of paying 50,000 euros (about US $57,000) in cash and the forgiveness of more than 20,000 euros (about US $22,700) in debt to three people a pizza parlor owner, a former police officer and a former soldier to organize and commit the murder.
During the summer, Kočner was arrested for financial crimes investigated by Kuciak, but it took authorities six more months to arrest the subordinates of the controversial entrepreneur and directly connect him to the assassination plot.
The reason for the murder was the journalistic work of the victim, a special prosecutor, who was left unnamed for security reasons, told reporters at a March 15 news conference near Bratislava.

The indictment was welcomed by media rights organizations and human rights advocates.
On Twitter, the Committee to Protect Journalists Gulnoza Said stated:
We welcome the news that Slovak authorities have charged a suspected mastermind for the murder of investigative journalist #JánKuciak.
This is a significant step, and a rare one in murders of journalists.
We hope authorities keep their promise to bring all perpetrators to justice, thereby making all journalists in Slovakia safer from violence.
Harlem Desir from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also noted:
I commend today's indictment against instigator of murder of journalist #JanKuciak in #Slovakia.
He paid unacceptable price for investigating corruption at the highest level & has become symbol for freedom of media to tackle mafia & crime.
Full statement: https://t.co/BB8bsemt6K
OSCE media freedom (@OSCE_RFoM) March 14, 2019
In May 2018, Kuciak was posthumously awarded the inaugural award for Journalists, Whistleblowers and Defenders of the Right to Information, by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) in the EU Parliament.
Named for slain Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, the award is intended to recognize the work and courage of individuals in exposing corruption and wrongdoing by the powerful.
Continuing Ján Kuciak's legacy
After Kuciak was murdered, OCCRP and its member centers completed and published some of his unfinished research.
In February 2019, they released a report based titled Unfinished lives, unfinished justice.
This was compiled by OCCRP, the Investigative Reporting Project Italy, Investigace.cz, and the Investigative Centre of Ján Kuciak (ICJK) based on Kuciaks reporting about organized crime in Slovakia and its ties to politics and law enforcement.
But ICJK revealed via Twitter how some authorities were not cooperating with them and that they were prevented from attending the press conference announcing the indictment of Kočner.
Today at 13:00, a press conference to the investigation of Martina and Jans murder will be held at the Special Prosecutor's Office.
We will not be there.
According to the prosecution, we are not journalists, just a curious public who can read it in the paper.
Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak (@icjkuciaka) March 14, 2019
Despite the fact that authorities have now charged the alleged mastermind of the killing, journalists and media advocates insist there are still unresolved questions related to the case, such as the rumored involvement of prominent politicians.
In particular, advocates are interested in learning what the former prime minister Fico and Robert Krajmer, former head of the Anti-Corruption Unit of the Slovak National Crime Agency, may have known about the murders.
Friends and family of Kuciak and Kušnírová have already asked authorities to investigate the ties of newly indicted Kočner with powerful officials that protected him over the last two decades.
Kušnírová's family lawyer is worried that Kočner's close friendship with Slovakias former general prosecutor, Dobroslav Trnka, could affect the progress of the case.
Screenshot of the website papa.mk, set up by the Government of Republic of North Macedonia on occasion of the Pope's visit on 7 May 2019.
Pope Francis will visit North Macedonia in May 2019, just two days after the second round of presidential elections.
It will be the first time a pope visits North Macedonia.
The visit is part of a three-day regional tour which will also include a stop in Bulgaria.
The government of North Macedonia has set up a website, papa.mk to facilitate the visit.
In line with the multicultural character of the country, the website contents are available in three languages: Macedonian, Albanian and English.
Some citizens have questioned the government's ownership of the website, claiming that it contradicts the country's secular character.
Macedonian citizens can apply for tickets to the Pontiff's Holy Mass, which are free of charge, through local churches, while foreigners must secure their places through the website.
The Mass will take place at the main square of the capital Skopje on May 7.
Catholics make up less than one percent of the population of North Macedonia, where about 65 percent have professed faith for Orthodox Christianity and about 33 percent are Muslim.
Despite its small size, the local Catholic community is considerably diverse as it includes ethnic Macedonians, Albanians, Croats, Slovenes, and Poles.
On the other hand, the country has religious significance for Catholicism because the capital Skopje is the birthplace of Mother Theresa (1910-1997), officially honored as Saint Theresa of Calcutta.
One of the most popular missionaries of the 20th century, and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, she was born in an ethnic Albanian family whose house was situated precisely on what is now the main town square.
The political aspect of the visit surpasses its religious significance.
As a head of state, the pontiff is scheduled to meet the prime minister and the outgoing president, whose mandate will end five days afterward.
The Macedonian public appears to see the visit as a sign of recognition by the West, and a boost to the government's efforts to bring the country closer to membership of NATO and the European Union.
Such sentiment is apparent in a tweet from retired police general Stojanche Angelov, who commented on the preparatory visit by the chief of Macedonian Public Safety Bureau to the Vatican.
Thanks to the wise, brave and determined international politics of this government, our small state moves forward with great strides!
The Director of PSB Sasho Tasevski prepares the highest security level for the Pope Francis stay in Skopje.
Stevo [Pendarovski] for president!
A month ahead of Pope's journey, Vatican News, the information system of the Holy See, added Macedonian language to its repertoire.
It is the 34th language available on the portal.
Skopje Bishop Kiro Stojanov said this is a first-fruit of Pope Francis Apostolic Visit.
Ahead of #PopeFrancis Apostolic Journey to #NorthMacedonia on 7 May, @VaticanNews adds a page dedicated to the Macedonian language.
In September, the Pope will visit Mozambique, Madagascar, and Mauritius.
Global Voices has covered the reactions in Mozambique to the tour.

On April 5, a group of around 20 Colombian activist collectives delivered a formal request to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for it open a criminal investigation about the mass killings of social leaders in their country.
The collectives and their supporters delivered the letter in person at The Hague after marching for over a week from Paris, while stopping in different cities in France and Belgium along the way where they've staged rallies and performances.
The photo below is from the kick-off gathering in Paris:
A homage to the 472 social leaders assassinated in Colombia, the walkers of The Hague made a piece of fabric with the names of [each of] the 472 [leaders].
We hope the government has enough with their security policies and this number doesn't continue swelling.
The march was spearheaded by The Netherlands Colombian Citizens Diplomacy Collective with other groups joining forces later on.
Participants have used the hashtag #MarchamosALaHaya (Marching to The Hague) and #MarchamosALaHaya5abril (Marching to The Hague April 5) to spread information about the initiative.
Colombian politicians Gustavo Bolívar and Antonio Sanguino have expressed support for the march.
Senator Gustavo Petro, who lost presidential elections in 2010 and 2018, also participated in the march through his organization Colombia Humana (Human Colombia).
A video by Adriaan Alsema, the founder of online media outlet Colombia Reports, shows some images of previous protests that were staged inside and outside Colombia against the killings of social leaders.
It also includes a brief explanation of the problem.
Over 163 community leaders and activists referred under the umbrella term líderes sociales in Colombia have been murdered over the past three years in Colombia, according to the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The Colombian Ombudsman has a much higher figure over 460 killings since 2016.
By any accounts, the number of violent deaths has soared since the 2016 peace agreement that for the most part ended the country's decades-long conflict between the government and the guerrilla group FARC.
Among many other directives, the peace agreement stipulates that the FARC will surrender all assets in exchange for participation in institutional politics.
But the FARC has left a vacuum of power since it left its former territories, which have now been occupied either by paramilitary groups or guerrilla dissidents that don't accept the peace process.
Social leaders are targeted for defending their communities from such groups, who usually run a monopoly on illegal drug trade or illegal mining on the areas they control.
According to Carlos Guevara, who coordinates the organization Somos Defensores (we are defenders, in Spanish), the social leaders are often killed in their own homes, in front of their families, and usually have no support from authorities when they seek justice:
Aggressions against people devoted to defend human rights in Colombia [has reached the level of] a humanitarian crisis [] they're being killed because they're pushing to move away from an economy deemed illegal and beneficial to drug traffickers and armed groups.
The Government is not taking action to protect these leaders
Meanwhile, The National Conference of Afrocolombian Organizations highlights an important aspect of the mass killings that tends to be set aside: the fact that most social leaders belong to ethnic minorities.
In addition, female leaders suffer from an additional layer of violence, as they are subjected to additional kinds of gender-based aggressions.
Colombia Twitter often uses the hashtag #NosEstánMatando (they're killing us) to talk about the killings of social leaders.
With the ICC march, activists hope to raise the international profile of their plight.
Meanwhile, the numbers don't cease to soar.
Since the start of 2019, 73 social leaders have been threatened just in the central Boyacá department.
Bruno Saraiva won an award in Hong Kong | photo provided by Bruno (20.04.2019)
On 17 April, the Mozambican athlete Bruno Saraiva won an international bodybuilding competition in Hong Kong.
After beating five competitors, the athlete won first place in the category of classic bodybuilding (classic physique), the most popular and important category in the event, which seeks to find the athlete who best displays their musculature in various positions.
Bruno also won in the overall category for the best athlete across all the sub-categories.
He participated in three categories in the Hong Kong Bodybuilding contest: mens athletic physique, mens fitness physique, mens sports model.
The contest is scheduled to be held next on 23 June.
In response to our request sent by Facebook chat about how the competition went, Saraiva highlighted that it was his first time at the contest, as well as the limited time he had for preparation:
Eu fui preparado pelo Castro Cazé em apenas poucos dias e lá fomos fazer as inscrições, e ele disse Bruno tu vais fazer a categoria que eu sempre quis que fizesses: a mais conhecida por Classic Physique e logo na minha primeira aparição ganhei na minha categoria e fui ganhar ainda o overall, como se fosse chamar todos os primeiros lugares da tua categoria.
I was trained by Castro Cazé in only a few days and then we went to do the registration, and he said Bruno youre going to do the category that I always wanted you to do: the one best known as Classic Physique and soon in my first appearance I won in my category and I then also won the overall, as it is called for all the first places of your category
Followed by over 24 thousand people on his Instagram account, Bruno, who resides in the capital Maputo, is a figure of reference for bodybuilders in Mozambique.
According to the Wikipedia entry for bodybuilding:
Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes.
An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.
In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.
Saraiva expressed his happiness with winning the award in Hong Kong in an Instagram post:
Thank you for the victory, Lord.
It is with much joy that I have the pleasure of announcing and sharing with you all my victory in the category Classic Physique and having won the overall in the global classic competition in Hong Kong
In another post, though, Bruno recounted the difficulties he went through before going to Hong Kong:
Please my friend read this message with a lot of kindness, because it is the purest reality.
I have no shame in saying it and I know that many will overreact.
When I was about to come to Hong Kong to compete I went around a lot of places knocking on doors asking for support, I spoke with various friends some of whom I was sure could help, and the answers from some were:
1.Bruno you're not going to make it or you dont have any chance of winning nor of finishing among the best;
2.Others said that they couldnt help me because it would be throwing away the money;
3.Others even said Bruno you must be smoking a lot of cannabis.
Ould Mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion piece published online.
Despite having his death sentence commuted more than a year ago, Mauritanian blogger Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir is still in prison.
Ould Mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion article published on the website of the newspaper Aqlame.
In the article, entitled Religion, Religiosity and Craftsmen, Ould Mkhaitir criticised the role of religion in Mauritanias caste system, using stories from the lifetime of prophet Muhammad to support his argument.
The original article has since been taken down by Aqlame, but is still available online.
A court convicted him of apostasy and sentenced him to death under Article 306 of the Mauritanian Penal Code.
In April 2016, a court of appeal upheld his sentence and referred his case to the Supreme Court, which then returned it to the appeal court for procedural irregularities.
In November 2017 his death sentence was commuted and reduced to two years in jail and a fine by the court of appeal.
However, despite having already served more than two years in prison, the authorities did not release Ould Mkhaitir.
Almost 18 months after the appeal court's decision to release him, he remains behind bars.
On April 24, 2019 Mauritania's justice minister said that Mkhaitir was in temporary detention and that only the Supreme Court can rule on his fate.
Article 306 of the Penal Code previously provided that if the convicted person repents before his or her execution, the Mauritanian Supreme Court could commute the death sentence to a jail sentence of between three months and two years, and a fine.
But in April 2018, the Mauritanian National Assembly passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for anyone convicted of blasphemous speech and acts deemed sacrilegious.
The timing of the enactment of the law just a few months after the court of appeal ordered Mkhaïtirs release appears to be related to his case, Human Rights Watch said in November 2018.
Critiques of racism and the caste system are taboo in Mauritania, and have spurred many political and legal threats against journalists and activists in recent years.
In 1981, Mauritania became the last country on earth to officially abolish slavery, and only criminalized the practice in 2007.
But since that time, UN officials and human rights workers have documented evidence that thousands of people, many of them ethnic Haratines of black African origin, are still enslaved, living in situations of forced labour, or otherwise facing caste-based discrimination.
The Mauritanian government denies that slavery still exists in the country, and many people like Ould Mkhaitir, who speak out against the practice and discrimination against Haratines, have been jailed and prosecuted.
Last September, authorities jailed and charged activist Abdallahi Salem Ould Yali with incitement to violence and racial hatred for posting messages in WhatsApp group denouncing the plight and the marginalisation of his community.

Photo taken by Wael Abbas and posted on the photojournalist's Twitter account.
Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, also known as Shawkan, spent five years in prison for simply doing his job as a journalist.
He was detained on August 14, 2013 as he was photographing the deadly dispersal of the Rabaa El Adaweya sit-in, in which supporters of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi gathered to protest a military coup that ended his presidency on July 3 that same year.
Egyptian security forces killed at least 817 people and injured many more, according to Human Rights Watch, when they dispersed the sit-in.
Shawkan, who was working for Demotix at the time of his arrest, spent almost four years in pre-trial detention before his trial, along with 739 other defendants in what came to be known as the Rabaa Dispersal Case, began.
In September 2018, a Cairo Criminal Court convicted him on spurious charges of murder and affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, and a few months later he was released from jail.
Shawkans supporters were thrilled to see him reunited with his loved ones when he was released on March 4.
But the journalist is actually only partially free.
Every evening at 6pm, he has to report to his local police station where he has to spend the night, before he is free again at 6am the following morning.
Shawkan needs to do this every day for five years after his release.
I want to be free so I can return to normal life, Shawkan told Deutsche Welle after his release in reference to his probation period.
On Twitter and Instagram, the journalist has been reflecting and posting about his life under these restrictive conditions and his daily hours of freedom, from 6am to 6pm.
On March 31, he posted about his visit to the pyramids in Giza.
The pyramids are at the back.
A trip nearby the place of supervision [police station where he has to spend the night] because of the [lack of] time.
On April 6, using the hashtag _# (half freedom in English) he posted a photo on Instagram, taken from his seat on a motorcycle.
He explained that in order to arrive to the police station on time each night, he travels by motorcycle so he can avoid traffic.
Shawkans story is not unique in Egypt.
Prominent Egyptian blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, who was released from jail on March 28, is also under a similar probation period.
Alaa spent five years in jail for defying a protest ban, and like Shawkan, he has to spend the night at a police station for the next five years.
Freedom for Alaa.
Since his release, Alaa has been speaking out against the conditions of his probation.
Photo by the Freedom for Alaa campaign.
Alaa has also been reflecting on life under probation.
I am happy to see your joy over my release, but I am unfortunately not free, Alaa wrote on Facebook days after his release.
Every day I surrender myself to a humiliation called [police] monitoring.
In another post, he wrote: I do not know how to describe the beautiful feeling of seeing [his son] Khaleds swimming lesson for the first time.
I also dont know how to describe the cruelty of leaving him in mid-lesson to be on time for the monitoring.
Alaas sister, Mona Seif, who is also a human rights activist, likened the conditions of her brothers imprisonment every night to solitary confinement.
Alaa has to turn himself in to Dokki police station every day at 6 pm and they let him go at 6 am.
When he turns himself in, they keep him isolated from all others in a small wooden kiosk within the police station.
They lock him in for 12 hrs.
These are worst conditions than the ones he had to endure in prison for five years.
Alaa is practically now spending half his day in solitary confinement in the police station, and he is looking at five years more of this nightmare
Alaa has also learned that speaking out against these conditions can pose a risk of additional jail time.
On the night of April 9, security officers threatened to throw him back in jail if he keeps exposing the conditions of his probation.
Ahmed Maher, a political activist with the April 6 Youth Movement, spent three years behind bars for illegal demonstration.
He was released in January 2017 and placed under police monitoring a period equal to the amount of time he spent in jail.
On Twitter, he described the conditions of this period:
Under police monitoring, where we sleep is much dirtier than in prison and there is more arbitrariness, even though according to law, they do not have the right to imprison us in a police station or to deprive us of our children, our work, our studies and our normal lives.
According to law, monitoring should be more gentle and more humane, but it is clear that the motivation is nothing but a desire to abuse and humiliate.
This practice of locking former prisoners overnight is an abuse of power.
According to legal analysts and human rights NGOs, those placed under monitoring are supposed to be able to spend the night in their homes.
Only those who are without a place to live in the area of their local police station, are required to spend the night in official custody.
Yasmin Omar and Mai El-Sadaby of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy wrote:
After an individual is sentenced to a probation period decided by the judge at sentencing, the law empowers the sentenced individual to designate a residence at which to serve his or her probation period.
However, the law additionally authorizes authorities to select a location for probation if no residence is provided, as well as to determine whether or not a location selected by the defendant is appropriate for police surveillance.
This discretion has been used to systematically erode the right of individuals to complete their probation periods at their stated residencea right guaranteed to them under lawand instead force individuals who have residences where police surveillance can clearly occur to spend them at police stations.
Yet at the end of each day, many Egyptians are forced to retreat to a small cell in a police station, away from their loved ones and the rest of the world: they are out of prison, but not really free.
Many are activists, protesters and journalists, whose only crimes were to exercise their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, assembly and protest.

On April 7, a Sunday, musician Evaldo dos Santos Rosa, 51, was on his way to a baby shower in Guadalupe, a poor neighborhood in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
In the car with him were his father-in-law, his wife, their 7-year-old son, and a friend.
The sun was up, and it seemed like a regular weekend in Brazil's largest coastal city.
As they drove by an army compound nearby, soldiers fired a hail of bullets towards the car.
Evaldo was killed on the spot, while his father-in-law along with a passerby that was near the scene were injured.
The other passengers managed to escape.
The police, which inspected the scene, later revealed the car was shot 80 times.
Leonardo Salgado, police chief, said he believed the officers mistook Evaldo's car to another one used by criminals which they were after, according to news website G1.
He added that police didn't find any weapons on Evaldo's car.
Luciana Nogueira, Evaldo's wife of 27 years who survived the shooting, told Estado de S. Paulo:
Os vizinhos começaram a socorrer (o meu marido), mas eles continuaram atirando.
Eu botei a mão na cabeça, pedi socorro, disse pra eles que era meu marido, mas eles não fizeram nada, ficaram de deboche.
The neighbors started to help (my husband), but [the soldiers] kept shooting.
I put my hands on my head, cried for help, told them that he was my husband, but they didnt do anything, the just stood there with debauchery.
While the brutal murder of an innocent man by state officials has shocked Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro remained silent about the incident for six days.
When he finally spoke, at a press conference on April 12, he said: The army didn't kill anyone, the army is of the people, and you can't accuse the people of murder.
Previously, the only words that came out of Planalto Palace, the executive's seat, was through the president's spokesperson, who referred to Evaldo's execution as an incident without offering condolences to his family.
In the evening of April 8, Rio de Janeiro's State Governor Wilson Witzel, an ally of Bolsonaro, declared that it wasnt up to him to make a judgment
Two days later, Minister of Justice and Public Security Sergio Moro only said the killing was unfortunate during an interview to a TV show.

Yes, the graphic is EMPTY, because no one manifested themselves, not even to say they felt sorry for what happened.
The car was shot 80 times by military men.
Military investigation
Shortly after news about the episode began circulating in the media, the army put out a statement saying its men were responding to unfair aggression by assailants.
Later in the evening of April 7, it released a different note, this time saying that it would conduct an investigation.
Although the civil police inspected the scene, they will not investigate the case.
The army itself will do it instead, and a military court will eventually try the soldiers.
That's thanks to a 2017 law that says armed forces themselves are responsible for investigating homicides committed by their personnel while on duty.
Human Rights Watch, who has criticized the law at the time of its approval by President Michel Temer, put out a statement on April 9 calling for an impartial investigation of the murder of Evaldo, and for the law to be repealed.
On April 8, the military arrested 10 of the 12 officers who had been deployed to the scene and charged them with homicide and attempted homicide, according to local newspaper Extra.
A judge released one of the 10 officers on April 10 following a hearing.
Not the first time
Brazil's police are known for shooting first, asking later, a saying that has been proven right time and again.
An International Amnestys report released this year says Brazilian police is the most deadly in the world.
Only in 2018, 15,6 percent of all homicides in the country were committed by law enforcement agents.
Just in Rio de Janeiro state, and just in January 2019, police have killed 160 people.
A bill dubbed anticrime package which the Bolsonaro's government is proposing in Congress could potentially increase those already-staggering figures.
The bill seeks to change several directives that will either scrape or significantly reduce penalties of police and military officers when they kill someone while on duty.
The circumstances of the murder of Evaldo, a 51-year-old black man, is not an exception but the rule in Brazil, as Samira Bueno and Renato Sérgio de Lima, directors of the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, have said in an article for Folha de São Paulo:
Evaldo teve sua vida ceifada por aqueles que juraram defendê-la.
Seu filho jamais se livrará do trauma de ter assistido ao pai ser fuzilado por agentes estatais.
Mas que fique claro que a culpa não é apenas daqueles que apertaram o gatilho.
Ou começamos a responsabilizar toda a cadeia de comando pelos atos cometidos, ou vamos continuar contando os nossos mortos e desacreditando as nossas instituições.
Evaldo has had his life taken from him by those who had sworn to defend it.
His son will never be over the trauma of watching his father being shot at by state agents.
But let us be clear that the fault lies not only with those who have pulled the trigger.
Either we start holding the entire chain of command accountable to their acts, or we will continue to count our dead while discrediting our institutions.
Dr. Wairagala Wakabi [Image by CIPESA and used with permission]Wairagala Wakabi, a leading digital rights advocate from Uganda, was detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 25.
Wakabi was invited to speak at the annual Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Day hosted by the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC).
Wakabi is the Executive Director of the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), one of the foremost organizations working on internet policy and online free speech in Africa.
Wakabi was deported back to Uganda after several hours of interrogation, during which he was denied access to a lawyer.
Attorneys from the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition attempted to advocate on his behalf, but were told only that Wakabi was being deported on grounds of national interest:
UPDATE: After hours of interrogation, Dr. Wakabi has been deported back to #Uganda this evening.
However, lawyers remained unable to establish the basis of the detention & deportation.
They report that authorities denied him entry into #Tanzania on grounds of national interest.

Though the ordeal lasted only a few hours, it brought great consternation among rights advocates in the region, who have grown wary of Tanzania's treatment of activists and journalists.
In November last year, Angela Quintal and Muthoki Mumo both staff of Committee to Protect Journalists, were detained for several hours in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and had their passports temporarily seized.
Is Tanzania on a deliberate crusade to silence human rights defenders by harassing them in order to dissuade them from coming into the country?
Late last year it was @pressfreedoms @angelaquintal and @muthokimumo not Dr Wakabi?
This cannot silence us!

Human Rights Watch asserted that Tanzania under the leadership President John Magufuli has witnessed a marked decline in respect for free expression, association and assembly.
In 2015, the United Republic of Tanzania promulgated the Cybercrimes Act.
Within a year of the passing of that law, at least 14 Tanzanians were arrested and prosecuted under the law for insulting the president on social media.
March 2018 saw the passing of the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, making it mandatory for bloggers to register and pay roughly US $900 per year to publish online.
This caused many independent blogs to go dark.
The stifling of independent media through a mixture of sanctions against media outlets and legal threats against journalists has created an atmosphere of intimidation, self-censorship and fear of expressing alternative views about the countrys leaders.
The detention and subsequent deportation of Wakabi back to Uganda appears to be a continuation of the Tanzania's government assault on free speech and dissent.
Alpha Condé at the World Economic Forum in 2012 CC BY-SA 2.0
Although Guineas constitution allows only two consecutive terms in office, the country's current president, Alpha Condé, recently announced that he intended to seek a third term.
To help achieve this, he has not hesitated to make calls to violence.
In an analysis published on Horizon Guinée, Sonny Camara, a journalist based in Conakry (the country's capital), reported parts of a speech the president made on March 24, 2019:
I will be taking off my president's hat.
I am putting on my activist's hat, because now I am ready to fight against these people [in the opposition] [] Be ready for confrontation [] Nobody in Guinea will stop me from going before my people to ask them what they want [for the country] [] If [the opposition] wants to walk all over you, be ready to walk all over them so that they know that you are afraid of nothing.
Condé was elected as President of Guinea in 2010 as the first freely elected president in the country's history.
However, the 2010 elections were not without controversies as observers, including the Carter center reported that nearly 1 million voters ballot were lost from the final count.
Condé was reelected in 2015 with almost 58 percent of the vote.
in 2016,
FRANCE 24 news channel reported that the mining company Rio Tinto paid Guinean government official $10.5 million for mining rights in the Simandou Region.
A few months after his re-election in May 2015, Condé began to suggest his intention to seek a third term.
Ibrahima Diallo, director of Liberté FM, a radio station in Conakry, highlighted this 2016 report on Nouvelles de Guinée:
Mais, à entendre Alpha Condé dire à lopinion publique nationale et internationale que le «souverain peuple» de Guinée décidera ou non dun troisième mandat pour lui sous entend que celui qui voulait être la «synthèse» de feu Mandela et dObama pour son pays est «pire» que ses prédécesseurs quil a toujours combattus durant sa vie déternel opposant.
Aujourdhui, quand Koro dit «cest le peuple qui décidera», il veut juste faire porter par le vaillant peuple de Guinée le mérite pour lui de briguer «un éventuel mandat» après les deux consécutifs.
But, to hear Alpha Condé say to national and international audiences that the sovereign people of Guinea will decide whether or not he will have a third term implies that he who wanted to be the synthesis of the late Mandela and Obama for his country is worse than his predecessors, whom he has fought all his life as an eternal opponent.
Today, when Koro (ed's note: nickname for Alpha Condé) says its the people who will decide, he just wants to make the valiant people of Guinea legitimize his seeking a possible term after the two consecutive ones.
Condé stuck to his plan by taking measures to ensure he avoided any bad surprises, including dismissing the president of the constitutional court, Kéléfa Sall, a move which did not follow legal procedure.
Amadou Tham Camara, a reporter with Guinée News, wrote:
After the undermining of the CENI [the national independent electoral commission], it is now the second constitutional institution in charge of national elections which has been irreparably weakened.
From now on, for the party in power, there is an avenue to having the qualified majority of two thirds of deputies during the legislative elections scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.
This majority being the necessary condition for initiating the revision of the constitution.
It is thus a giant step which has been taken to break through the constitutional lock which limits the number of terms as President of the Republic at two.
It seems that Sall's mistake was to warn Condé during his second term swearing-in ceremony, no less against modifying the constitution.
Sall said then:
The management of the nation must gather us around what is essential.
We do not surround ourselves with extremists who are harmful to national unity.
Always avoid slips toward paths forbidden under democracy and good governance.
Refrain from succumbing to the song of revisionist sirens because, although the people of Guinea gave you and renewed their confidence, they nevertheless remain legitimately vigilant.
The reaction of Guineans has been lively.
At a press conference on March 29, organized by former members of the National Transition Council (a type of interim parliament) and hosted by the collective Ne Touche pas à ma Constitution (Dont Touch My Constitution), Boubacar Siddighy Diallo, one of the speakers, recalled that Guineas constitution comprises two parts which form an indivisible whole.
He made the point that together, these parts shield the constitution from any possible tampering which could have consequences that compromise the peace and stability of our country.
Opponents reacted strongly.
At an opposition meeting, Cellou Dalein Diallo, president of the Union des Forces Démocratiques de Guinée (The Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, a liberal political party), said:
The Republican opposition has reaffirmed its readiness to form a coalition with all the active movements of the nation, to oppose democratic retreat and the presidency for life that Alpha Condé wants to grant himself
Sekou Koundouno, leader of the Forces Sociales de Guinée (FSG) the Social Forces of Guinea) announced on Facebook that his civil society group wrote to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asking her to keep a close eye on our country and take a public stand to avoid chaos in Guinea.
Similarly, Guinean citizens reacted on Twitter:
The words of the president of the republic are extremely serious for peace and social calm in Guinea.
Yet again, I strongly condemn this not very honourable habit of our country.
We absolutely must call on the CEDEAO [the Economic Community of West African States], the African Union, the UN, etc.
Everywhere in Guinea, the people are speaking out against the third term.
Such was the case in Coyah [a prefecture in Guinea's Kindia region] earlier. Four young people were reportedly arrested on the instructions of one of the promoters of the third term.
No intimidation will stop Guineans in their quest for democracy.
Popular Facebook personality Alimou Sow chose irony as a way of commenting on the situation, alluding to the strong winds which hit Conakry on the night of April 2:
It seems that in Greek mythology Aeolus was the god of the winds (whence the adjective Aeolian).
So, to Guinea Aeolus went that night to blow away, not only the demagogic posters, but also those who put them up and promote the third [term] #Nambara [Problems].
Gone with the wind.
Good night #ennui
The most significant reaction, however, came from the Guinean writer and economist, Ibrahima Sanoh.
On January 2, he launched his movement, Patriotes pour lAlternance et le Salut (Patriots for Alternation and Salvation), to oppose any attempt by Condé to seek a third term in 2020.

In March 2019, Mozambican professor Emília Nhalevilo took office as dean of the recently-created Púnguè University, becoming thus the first women to ever lead a public university in the African country.
She was nominated by President Filipe Nyusi, but the decision about the recently-created universities was announced by the Council of Ministers on January 29.
Nhalevilo will remain in office, in principle, for a period of four years.
Born in Nampula, the most populous province in Mozambique, Nhalevilo holds a doctorate and master's degree in education from the University of Perth, Australia, and a bachelor's degree in science education from Pedagogical University (UP).
From 2005 to 2007, she worked as Professor at Curtin University of Technology, in Australia.
In 2008, Nhalevilo became the head of the chemistry department at UP, and then took office as deputy director of the Center for Mozambican Studies and Ethnoscience, a research center at the same institution.
In 2017, she was a fellow with the Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development of New York University, in the United States.
Nhalevilo was the vice-dean for research and extension in the UP since 2018.
As dean of a public university, her current position is equivalent to that of a minister in Mozambique.
Eliana Nzualo, an activist and feminist blogger, says Nhalevilo's appointment is a historic moment:
UM DIA NA HISTÓRIA
Professora Doutora Emília Nhalevilo é a primeira mulher na liderança de uma Universidade Pública em Moçambique.
Parabéns à Magnífica Reitora!
Por mais mulheres nas Universidades,
Por mais mulheres na liderança!
HISTORY DAY
Professor Emília Nhalevilo is the first woman to lead a Public University in Mozambique.
Congratulations to the Magnificent Rector!
For more women in the Universities,
For more women in the lead!
In Mozambique, women still face challenges in accessing leadership and management positions.
But there have been improvements: in the current parliament, for example, both the president of the assembly and the heads of the two largest political caucus are women.
But gender inequality still prevails in the southern African country.
The UNDP's 2016 Africa Human Development Report, whose title is Accelerating Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Africa, revealed that Mozambican women and girls continue to suffer from inequalities, such as poor access to justice, poor access to school and health care, and repeated acts of violence.
In 2018, there were 25,356 cases of domestic violence in Mozambique, of which 12,500 were against women and 9,000 against children.
Mozambique ranks 10th in the world for child marriages, according to a UNICEF report from 2015.
The organization defines child marriage as a marital union in which at least one person is under the age of 18.
In mid-2018, pilot Admira António became the first woman to ever captain a flight in Mozambique, while in December 2018, an all-female flight crew took to the skies for the first time.
In 2014, when the Police of the Republic of Mozambique turned 39, Arsenia Massingue was presented as the first woman general in the corporation.

Pope Francis will visit Mozambique in September 2019, just weeks before elections that will choose the new president, members of the Republican Assembly, and provincial governors.
The Pope was invited by Mozambiques president, Filipe Nyusi, in September 2018.
The visit was announced as confirmed on 26 March in a solemn ceremony which involved bodies of the Catholic Church in the country.
President Nyusi said that the Popes visit would help to strengthen peace talks with the opposition party RENAMO, which stopped military hostilities with the government in 2017 as part of a process which is still fraught with tensions.
He added that it would also be an occasion to reflect on the conflict with paramilitary groups acting in the north of the country, specifically in the province of Cabo Delgado.
John Paul II was the last pope to visit Mozambique, in September 1988.
The confirmation of the Popes visit had already been anticipated since mid-February.
Mozambique will hold elections this October and it's still recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Idai, which left over 500 dead and more than a million homeless.
The Pope has shown solidarity with the victims:
Expresso a minha dor e a minha solidariedade às queridas populações de Moçambique, Zimbábue e Malauí, atingidas pelo ciclone Idai.
Confio as inúmeras vítimas e suas famílias à misericórdia de Deus.
#PrayForAfrica #cycloneIdai
Papa Francisco (@Pontifex_pt) 20 mars 2019
I express my pain and my solidarity with the beloved peoples of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, hit by Cyclone Idai.
I entrust the countless victims and their families to the mercy of God.
The disaster caused by the cyclone, already considered one of the worst to have ever hit the Southern Hemisphere, struck the city of Beira in central Mozambique on 14 March, and then hit the neighbouring countries of Zimbabwe and Malawi.
More than 300 people died in these two countries.
Since then, the country has remained in a state of emergency, which has led the government to review the electoral calendar and postpone the registration period.
In the middle of a disaster, govnt still trying to figure out how to rescue & accommodate thousands of people after #CycloneIdai, president Nyusi gives LIVE tv statement to the nation to announce that the Pope is set to visit Mozambique in September.
Bad timing is understatement.
Zenaida Machado (@zenaidamz)
The fact that the elections will be held soon after the papal visit has raised questions from some citizens, who are concerned that it could have an impact on campaigning:
It is clear that Pope Francis visit in September plays in favour of #Frelimo and Filipe #Nyusi.
Directly or indirectly the visit will be politically profited from.
It would be good if it was postponed to November, that is, after the confusion of the general elections scheduled for 15 October.
Screenshot of La Pulla's episode Pablo Escobar is a Hero, available on YouTube.
The phenomenon didn't start with the Netflix series, but Narcos certainly helped revive 1980s Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's status in North American popular culture.
Since it premiered in 2015, the controversial series has fueled conversations about Colombia's persistent international image as a cocaine paradise dominated by charismatic drug traffickers.
As a response, the Colombian journalists behind YouTube channel La Pulla (in Spanish, the taunt), a project by Colombian newspaper El Espectador, made a video responding to people who still glorify Escobar as a hero.
Among other things, the video highlights tragic episodes and statistics of one of the darkest periods of Colombia's history, such as the assassination of El Espectador's former director Guillermo Cano on December 17, 1986, and the bomb attack next to their offices in September 1989.
It is common in other countries to see people with T-shirts of him, encouraged by series such as Netflix's Narcos.
And then when they come to Colombia they pay a lot of money to go on a tour so they can admire his great accomplishments.
This hero prompted thousands of people to run towards drug trafficking money [like] pigeons chasing corn and rendered the national economy into a little pot to launder the money that came from drug trafficking.
This hero was not a friend of the people: he committed 623 attacks, left 1710 civilians in pain, and killed 402.
This hero forced us to escape from an abandoned briefcase in the street or from a stationed car with no one inside [thinking] there [it was] one more bomb.
This hero forced us to stay indoors, to suspect from everyone, and to react with fire and violence.
This hero forced us to live in constant fear.
The tours referenced in the video are known as Narco Tours, and they guide tourists around the city of Medellin through famous spots related to Pablo Escobar's life.
In 2018, Global Voices partner Radio Ambulante described the tour in one of the episodes of their award-winning podcast.
A photo of the deputy Ana Paula on the first day in office.
Source: Facebook Personal Page, fair use.
For her state legislature inauguration on January 31, newly-elected Brazilian deputy Ana Paula da Silva wore a bright red dress and jewelry.
She posted a photo of the occasion on her Facebook and, on the next day, she woke up with a flurry of hateful comments.
The reason: her cleavage.
Ana Paula da Silva is one of the five women out of 40 legislators elected to the legislative assembly of Santa Catarina, a southern Brazilian state.
Her photo received 6,400 comments and 6,447 shares, including many offenses and threats.
But that is not the first time in Brazil that a woman's outfit choice has eclipsed her skills on her workplace
Male guide to female attire
In 2009, Porto Alegre city councilor Fernanda Melchionna took to the house's tribune wearing a black-and-white striped tie to protest a bill that would impose a dress code on female legislators.
Melchionna, who is now a state deputy, usually goes to work wearing jeans and trainers, which a male colleague thought was inappropriate.
She said that the debate around women's wardrobes was fit for the lazy, for those who do not use their mandates to work on social problems.
It is not only in politics that women go through such experiences.
In 2017, lawyer Pamela Helena de Oliveira Amaral vowed to sue a judge after he interrupted a trial to scold her choice of clothing.
Pamela was wearing a long blue dress that revealed her shoulders.
Judge Eugênio Cesário left the room and only came back after Pamela had borrowed a blazer from a female colleague.
Pamela said in an interview at that time:
I was astonished, confused.
I still haven't quite comprehended it all.
It was humiliating, embarassing and disturbing what he made me go through in front of my colleagues.
The room was full of students and other lawyers.
On a post titled Girl Power and Power Dressing: femininity in politics, blogger Nawsheen Rumjaun analyzes how people tend to perceive women's choice of dress in political environments:
the number of powerful women is increasing, but being a woman in politics is still tough.
The clothes they choose constitute a weapon to establish their authority in this mans world.
In politics, there is no pre-set dress-code but an unspoken rule that men should wear a suit, and women should have a decent outfit.
Those who cross the fine line between what is judged decent, and what is not, are at risk of being blamed because of their attire.
The length of the neckline
Ana Paula received 51,739 votes, making her the fifth most voted legislator in her state.
In an interview for Universa, a local website that covers women's issues, she commented on the attacks: The participation of women in society is so tiny that a neckline can become a huge issue, she said.
She also posted a video on her Facebook page responding to the offenses.
The comments on that video, however, were also packed with insults.
A user named Vitor said:
With all due respect, but have you forgotten in what environment you will work in the next few days?
Formality, please.
Be respectful!
Parliamentary decorum.
Another user, a woman named Yelena Sier, received 252 replies to her comment in which she criticized the politician:
Geral não entende!!
No one goes to a hospital wearing a bikini, children do not go to school in pajamas, men do not go to buy bread in their underwear, no one has surgery wearing whatever clothes, no one goes to sweet fifiteen parties or a wedding in their pajamas, etc. every occasion requires an appropriate attire, in companies there are uniforms and so on, and everyone knows that.
The issue here is not about what a woman wears or doesn't wear, but that each place has an appropriate attire.
On a different post, Rosimere Furtado defended Ana Paula's right to dresses as she chooses:
Congratulations for raising this issue!
While a state representative in a highly-respectful dress persecutes educators and states that education does not need financial investment, you have started a discussion about the importance of women in politics, about femicide, about causes that are independent of color or attire.
In a world where the mind is misrepresented and sexuality is exarcebated, any cleavage is a subject of war!!
Ana Paula fired back at her attackers by reminding them of her curriculum: before she was elected to the state assembly, she had been twice elected mayor of the city of Bombinhas and left office with a 90 percent approval rate.
Ana Paula also posted on Facebook an interview in which she said: Women are in politics and society has to get used to them as they are.
There are much more important issues for the legislative assembly to discuss.
She also documented the attacks and said that she would sue the people who have harassed her.
She told another interviewer:
Vou continuar vestindo o que eu quero.
Não pretendo me violentar para agradar ninguém
I will continue to wear whatever I want.
I do not intend to abuse myself in order to please others.
Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor is currently serving a ten-year jail sentence in the UAE.
Photo Credit: Martin Ennals Foundation, via Citizen Lab.
Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor has endured an open-ended hunger strike since approximately mid-March 2019.
His supporters say his health is rapidly deteriorating.
Security officials arrested Mansoor from his home on March 20, 2017 over comments he posted online.
In May 2018, he was convicted under the 2012 Cybercrime Law of insulting the status and prestige of the UAE and publishing false reports and information on social media to damage the UAE's relationship with its neighbouring countries.
A court sentenced him to ten years in jail and fined him 1,000,000 Emirati Dirhams (US $270,000).
Mansoor has been advocating for democratic reform and protection of human rights in his country and the region for more than a decade.
He is the 2015 laureate of the Martin Ennals Foundation, which supports human rights defenders who are at risk.
He is a member of the Human Rights Watch Middle East and North Africa Advisory Committee.
This is not Mansoor's first time behind bars.
In 2011, he and four other political activists were jailed in relation to their connections to UAEHewar.net, an online discussion forum run by Mansoor.
He also used the forum to publish a petition calling for democratic reforms in the UAE.
State officials used this as a basis for charging Mansoor with insulting UAE leaders.
He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but was released on presidential pardon after serving only seven months.
Prior to his 2017 arrest, he campaigned online on behalf of jailed activists in the UAE and elsewhere in the region.
The day before his arrest, he tweeted his concern about the continuous and arbitrary detention of Emirati activist Osama al-Najjar, who remained in prison despite having completed his three-year jail sentence.
According to Human Rights Watch, he also signed a joint letter with other activists in the region calling on leaders at the Arab League summit in Jordan in March 2017 to release political prisoners in their countries.
In December 2018, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, whose verdicts are final, confirmed his ten-year sentence.
According to the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR), Mansoor began the strike to protest poor prison conditions and his unfair trial:
Mansoor is believed to be currently held in Al-Sadr prison in Abu Dhabi, where he is kept in isolation.
A source told GCHR that he is being held in terrible conditions in a cell with no bed, no water and no access to a shower.
His health has deteriorated greatly and he is in bad shape.
Human rights groups expressed concerns about the activist's health, calling on the UAE authorities to set him free.
Ahmed Mansoor is risking his health to call attention to his deeply unjust imprisonment simply because he advocated for the kind of tolerant, progressive society the UAE claims to be, said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
UAE authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Mansoor so that he can continue to serve as a voice for justice in a region desperately in need of it, she added.
The International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE called on the authorities to treat Mansoor in accordance with international human rights standards and to allow international rights groups to visit him in prison:
We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of Ahmed Mansoor.
Pending this, we urge the Emirati authorities to treat him in line with the UNs Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which guarantees the provision of medical care and sanitary prison conditions.
To ensure this, it is imperative that international NGOs be allowed access to al-Sadr prison to visit Mansoor.

The woman's jirga councils are taking place in provinces across Afghanistan.
Photos used with permission from Afghan Women for Peace.
In the coming months, Afghanistan will host its first-ever national-level all-women council, where thousands are coming together to remind the government and the Taliban that a long-awaited peace is impossible without their voice.
Over the past decades of war, women in Afghanistan have experienced shocking oppression that has deepened their social isolation and made them politically cautious.
Anti-women policies at state level peaked under the Taliban, who took power in the mid-1990s before they were ousted by a U.S.-led invasion.
The woman's jirga councils are taking place in provinces across Afghanistan.

That invasion led to gains in universal education, but women remain plagued by insecurity and the threat of violence.
Quotas for female representation in the legislature have not fundamentally changed the male-dominated nature of Afghan political culture.
Now, a resurgent Taliban's appearance at negotiating tables in Moscow and Doha has put even these qualified achievements under threat.
The group remains steadfast in its non-recognition both of women's role in the public space and the Afghan government, with whom it has not yet held direct talks.
Presently the Taliban prefers to speak to Washington, Moscow and select groups of Afghan politicians.
The group has said its position on women's rights is in line with that of Afghanistan's main religion, Islam and remains hostile to gender equality activism.

Being heard
In the meantime, Afghan women and womens rights activists from all walks of life came together and established Afghan Women for Peace, a 15,000 plus movement with members come from all 34 provinces.
The movement began six months ago as a shared initiative of the Afghan Womens Network, Ministry of Women Affairs, High Peace Council, and the Office of the First Lady of Afghanistan.
15,000 women across the country came together in 34 gatherings, one in each province, to raise their voices & discuss what peace means in their own community, what are their expectations & what are the costs of peace.
Afghan Women for Peace (@AfgWomen4Peace) February 20, 2019
In every province, Afghan Women for Peace brought together university students and female governmental employees, as well as literate and illiterate women looking to contribute.
Together they have shared their demands and thoughts on peace.

The organizers have spoken about the role of women in the government and in society, and shared ways to have a positive impact on society and make their voices heard by local and national authorities.
The first aim is to create a national consensus that Afghan women shouldn't be forgotten.
Women need to take part in the peace talks and share their demands and expectations for the future of the county.

Conferences have already been held in a number of provinces including Panjshir, Khost, Parwan, Baghlan, Ghazni, and Logar.
Conferences will continue in 28 other provinces over coming weeks.
What follows are the highlights of the conference Khost province:
Peace should begin from the frontier provinces
Khost province is the economic and political corridor of Afghanistan
People at the district level should be included in the peace process
Engaging people who are in touch with the families of insurgents is crucial
If social justice is in place and laws implemented, peace will come
God and the prophet ( PBUH), and the people all want peace
Women and girls should be allowed to go to school
Female literacy should be increased so that children are brought up properly.
Todays women are aware and religious scholars should not undermine the importance of womens roles
Sharia dictates about women need to be interpreted properly
Peace begins in the family, then in the community, and then reaches the government
Peace means accepting one another and supporting each others positive actions
At the conclusion of every conference, participants approve such a resolution about the priorities and problems facing local women.
While no date has yet been set for the national-level jirga (tribal council), the event promises to bring together the work of all the provincial level groups.
Work at the provincial level is important.
Whilst there are women representatives in the parliament in Kabul, women governors are very rare, as is female representation in other important.
For many women in the frontier provinces, these jirgas have been a first-ever opportunity to participate in the political process and have their voices heard.
Women in Ghazni stated:
Peace does not mean just an end to the war, and no country can be successful in its national programs without the participation of women; therefore women must have a role in the social and political peace process.

An interview given by the President of Angola João Lourenço to RTP, Portugals public television channel, in which he stated that there was no hunger in his country, caused some outrage among citizens.
During the 30-minute interview broadcast on 4 March, the Portuguese journalist of RTP África referred to a UNICEF report which stated people were dying of hunger in Angola.
Lourenço then rejected the existence of starvation in the country, while admitting that there was malnutrition.
He said:
Our struggle is to reduce the rates of poverty, owing to the long years of armed conflict.
Today there is a supply of food in Angola, one cannot say that today there is [serious] hunger in Angola, it is a question of some malnutrition.
President João Lourenço said this just before the visit to Angola of Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and a few days before a Catholic priest and human rights activist criticized the death of Angolans from hunger in a region suffering from drought.
The activist Manuel Mapanda, better known as Dago Nível, questioned the Presidents comments:
How is the gentleman going to say that hunger does not exist in Angola?
Did he not read the criticism of Father Jacinto Wacussanga about the death of an Angolan from hunger?
Does it mean that in Gambos and Curoca there is now no hunger?
As soon as Jlo [João Lourenço] assumed the presidency the majority of Angolans got basic essential goods, and hunger was eliminated?
During the unfortunate interview, the Angolan head of state also made clear his intention to combat corruption, which is part of the party's electoral programme:
Ninguém pode garantir que daqui para a frente não haverá corrupção e, que não haverá corruptos, mas que não ficarão impunes tal como sempre foi.
Não haverá mais intocáveis, segundo João Lourenço.
Esse tempo ficou para trás.
Nobody can guarantee that from this moment onwards there will be no corruption and that there will be no corrupt people, but that they will not remain unpunished.
There will be no more untouchables, according to João Lourenço.
That time is behind us.
In 2018, the Regional Forum for University Development (FORDU), a civic association in the field of education headquartered in southern Angola, produced a documentary (with no online version) entitled Angola, a country at risk.
It highlights the high number of people searching for food in bins, both in the urban centre of Huambo province, the documentary focus, and in the countrys capital Luanda.

On JM.
We need to recognize that there are still many people in Angola living at the margins of society, a problem that will be difficult to resolve if there is not a promotion of credible programs of social inclusion, where it is held accountable.
And not with this birth of a new elite of crooks who didnt get away with it before, who take advantage of the opening now where the main protagonist and financier of the nation is J.Lourenço.
Look at what the main challenges are right in front of your eyes, to overcome problems in the areas of health, education, housing, etc., which should at least already be showing some signs even if slight, but nothing can be seen
A Screenshot of ICT Minister Idah Nantaba who survived the assassination attempt, via YouTube video.
On March 24, 2019, news broke that Ugandan Information and Communications Technology Minister of State Hon. Idah Nantaba had survived an assassination attempt.
Ugandan police shot and killed one of her assailants in the small town of Nagojje, 53 kilometers east of the capital Kampala.
Over the last five years, numerous cases of assassinations of high-profile political, religious or military people have led to few concrete convictions or clear reports.
Ugandan citizens were, therefore, relieved to hear that the police had taken swift action.
However, a more complicated story has emerged regarding mistaken identity. Here's what happened:
Nantaba called the police to inform them that two men on a motorbike had been trailing her for more than 40 kilometers.
Police swung into action and intercepted two men on a motorbike near the Nagojje Trading center.
Ronald Ssebulime, 40, a single father of four, was a driving a regular motorcycle and carried a passenger behind him.
Police mistook the two men as Nantaba's assailants.
A chase ensued and Ssebulime hit a hump.
He and his passenger fell off the bike and the two fled on foot. Police fired shots in the air and Ssebulime eventually surrendered.
The passenger fled.
Ssebulime pleaded innocent, but police handcuffed and threw him into a police vehicle.
They drove for a short distance and then said the order had changed before they shot and killed him, according to several eyewitnesses who spoke with NTV Uganda.
One eyewitness said:
[Ssebulime] was picked up from the patrol van [already in] handcuffs and shot.
Another said:
The policeman took two steps back and shot him twice.
Botched investigation
In the confusion that followed, police tweeted that the shooting was justified because the men riding on the motorbike refused to surrender:
Several shots were fired in their direction, to cause them to surrender, but all in vain.
In the process, Sebbulime Ronald a resident of Nakabugo Village, Nakabugo Parish, Pakiso Sub County, and Busiro County in Wakiso District was shot dead during the pursuit.
Uganda Police Force (@PoliceUg) March 24, 2019
They added that a second suspect disappeared and fear he is armed and dangerous, although police could not confirm this.
Police is still searching the area with canine dogs for the second suspect, who is feared armed and dangerous.
We want to inform the public that the Minister, despite the scare is very safe and was not attacked at any stage as alleged in the media.
Police spokesman Fred Enanga said that the minister, witnesses and police officers involved in the pursuit would give statements while they continue to investigate Ssebulime's phone records as well as registration papers belonging to his motorbike.
Irene Nakazibwe, sister of the deceased, insists her brother was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
According to Nakazibwe, Ssebulime was, in fact, heading to St. Andrews Secondary School to visit two of his children studying senior one and senior three classes, in an interview with NTV.
They had spoken earlier in the day about the visit.
Ssebulime lost his wife back in 2012 and has been taking care of his four children as a single father.
It is unclear why he tried to run from the police when he had a National ID card and a driving permit.
Nakazibwe tells her story on NTV Uganda:
On March 27, 2019, the police finally admitted that Ssebulime was mistakenly identified and wrongfully murdered by officers and sent sympathies to the family of the deceased.
They also confirmed that Ssebulime was unarmed and only carried a bag full of soda and food intended for his children.

Boda-boda paranoia
The death of Ssebulime has stirred mixed emotions among those who use boda-boda, or motorcycle taxi, as a popular form of affordable transport.
At least five high profile murders involving military chiefs, members of parliament, religious leaders have occurred in the last three years all performed by hitmen riding on motorbikes.
This has put both boda-boda drivers and high-level officials on high alert.
Twitter user Ganda Gannyana thinks the reason Ssebulime was killed without substantial proof of intentions to assassinate the minister stems from directives following the murder of Member of Parliament Hon. Ibrahim Abiriga.
President Yoweri Museveni said that if a leader suspects someone is trailing them with bad intentions, they should sort that person out:
It was a stupid directive from @KagutaMuseveni that if you only suspect anyone trailing you, sort them out first and quick and the rest we sort later.
Now see!?
An innocent #SsebulimeRonald has been slain.
Shot in handcuffs; thats cold blood
GandaGannyana (@IAmSegawa) March 26, 2019
Twitter user Kyeyune Moses contemplates the confusion surrounding the circumstances of Ssebulime's death:
The story of Ronald Ssebulime is bigger than meets the eyes.
Different accounts of who shot the suspected assassin and how the he was killed.
But most touching is the tell of his kids now at school.
They lost their mother, their dad is now gone.
Will justice prevail?
pic.twitter.com/0Q0fVS8v4Z
KYEYUNE W. MOSES (@moskyeyune) March 25, 2019
Twitter user Angelo Peter is furious that the police failed to produce any evidence that Ssebulime was dangerous before they shot and killed him:
When @PoliceUg wanted to pin BobiWine for treason they produced guns they found in his hotel room in less than 24hrs.
But they can't produce and show us the gun Ronald ssebulime had before they shot him dead after arrest.
In a press briefing, Nantaba narrates her story and questions who might have given the order to murder Ssebulime.
She suggests the whole scenario could have been orchestrated as a cover-up by masterminds of high profile assassinations and still believes Ssebulime may have been involved in her assassination attempt:
The masterminds of these assassinations that have been happening in this country and according to what we see will still continue because [Ssebulime] was the one who was supposed to be a witness but the primary witness has been killed!
Edward Lowassa was a long-time ruling party CCM member until he was banned from running for president and joined opposition party CHADEMA.
Recently, he bounced back to CCM.

October 18, 2015.
In Tanzania, high-profile opposition party members have defected to the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or the Party of the Revolution, casting a shadow on multi-party politics in the East African nation.
Most defectors come from the leading opposition party, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo, or CHADEMA, the Democracy and Development party. Four CHADEMA members of parliament, 75 councilors and several village chairmen have joined CCM in the last few years.
The Tanzania Constitution Forum has called for a constitutional amendment to bar defections. The aim is to avoid unnecessary costs the government incurs in organizing frequent by-elections, said TCF chairman Hebron Mwakagenda, according to the East African.
The National Electoral Commission has conducted several by-elections at a high cost that yielded below 50 percent voter turnouts.
Campaigns have created fear and lack of trust among citizens.
The case of Edward Lowassa
On March 1, 2019, retired prime minister Edward Lowassa, member of the central committee of CHADEMA, bounced back to CCM, his longtime party, after defecting from it four years ago.
At a brief public ceremony, CCM chairman and Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli warmly welcomed Lowassa:
Mr. Lowassa has shown himself to be a true gentleman.
We are taught to forgive and our aim is to build a new, united Tanzania with no political conflicts.
Lowassa confirmed that he is back home and there is no reason now for him to be in opposition.
Lowassa is one of few groomed by one of the earliest parties, the Tanganyika African National Union party, or TANU, formed before Tanzania's independence from Britain in 1961, and later, CCMs youth wing during the days of a single-party system.

Under the auspices of CCM, Lowassa served as MP for the Monduli district for 25 years and held ministerial responsibilities in parliament over four decades.
In 2008, while serving as prime minister under then-President Jakaya Kikwete, Lowassa was forced to resign after being implicated in a fraud scandal.
Lowassa moved to CHADEMA on August 4, 2015, just before the general election, after the CCM banned him from running as a presidential candidate.
He condemned CCM and its leaders as dictators, undemocratic and greedy power mongers.
CHADEMA then nominated Lowassa as a presidential candidate under UKAWA, a coalition of opposition parties.
In the 2015 general election, Lowassa obtained 6 million votes, around 40 percent, against CCMs Magufuli, who got 8.8 million votes or nearly 60 percent.
With Lowassas political influence, opposition parties, CHADEMA earned 70 seats in parliament compared to 48 in 2010, while the Civic United Front (CUF), also a member of UKAWA, earned 45 seats compared to 36.
Welcomed or lured back?
Lowassas return to the ruling party sparked both praise and ridicule from politicians and prominent political analysts.
CCM spokesman Humphrey Polepole congratulated Lowassa for his bold move to return to his longtime party:
To come back to apologize is a great wisdom and humility.
Others have argued that high defection rates are not good for national politics.
Magdalena Sakaya, CUF deputy secretary general for mainland Tanzania, said the move is bad for democracy, and signals a conspiracy to kill the opposition, she added.
Dr. Adolf Mihanjo, head of the faculty of philosophy and religious studies at the University of Dar es Salaam, termed defectors as people who lack ideology and only seek leadership positions:
People have started feeling that defectors are being bribed this is dangerous.
Likewise, CUF deputy secretary general for the islands of Zanzibar, Nassoro Mazrui, expressed pessimism with Tanzanias political future, saying corruption has engulfed multi-party politics.
CHADEMA chairperson Freeman Mbowe believes that defectors are being lured by CCM as a way of muzzling the opposition.
However, Maulid Mtulia and Godwin Mollel, two defectors who joined CCM last year, said they made the switch out of satisfaction with Magufulis performance.
Opposition party leader Zitto Kabwe, of the ACT-Wazalendo party and MP for Kigoma Urban, rejected their claims, calling them empty reasons without grounds and backings.
Dr. Richard Mbunda, a political science professor at the University of Dar es Salaam, cautioned that it is hard to regain legitimacy once it's gone.
Defections create self-disenfranchisement which can be disastrous: The government could slip as a democracy which could then lead to civil disobedience and illegitimate governance, he observed.
Squeezed civic space for opposition political parties
Tanzania legalized multi-party democracy in 1992 under Article 3 (1) of the constitution.
In a multi-party democracy, political parties play a fundamental role in providing stability and peace needed for peaceful political transitions.
However, the current government has imposed a series of restrictions that limit the power of opposition parties, such as limitations on political rallies and live-broadcasting parliamentary sessions.
In February, new amendments to the Political Parties Act were passed that further limit opposition politics.
Since Magufuli assumed power in 2015, there's been a continuous squeeze on civic, political and social spaces through various bills and legislation to limit freedom of expression online and in the streets.

What does it all mean?
Politicians including national party leaders are only allowed to hold rallies within their constituencies.
Violators face arrest and prosecution.
ACTs Kabwe was ordered to report to the regional police commander of the southern region of Lindi for conducting a political rally out of his constituency.
Kawe district MP Halima Mdee was arrested after speaking to her voters for the reason of conducting a meeting without permission.
Given the current state of Tanzania multi-party politics with defections of heavyweight opposition party members like Lowassa, multi-party politics struggle to thrive.
Since its beginning, though, the hope was for the scope of democracy to expand.

Mauritanian authorities arrested two bloggers, Abderrahmane Weddady and Cheikh Ould Jiddou, for reporting on corruption.
Weddady and Jiddou were arrested on March 22, after they appeared before Mauritanias Economic Crimes Unit to respond to a summons.
Both had investigated and reported on allegations of corruption involving the countrys president, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.
Prior to their arrests, they both wrote on Facebook about the alleged ties of Ould Abdel Aziz to a US $2 billion bank account in Dubai.
According to media reports, Emirati authorities had frozen the account at the request of the US Department of the Treasury, in its fight against money laundering.
Weddady wrote on his Facebook page that police questioned him about his sources and asked why he did not wait for the state to investigate the matter.
He answered that the news of the frozen assets was reported online and by foreign media, and that he has no faith in a serious investigation into any crime involving the president and those around him.
In early March, both bloggers were summoned and questioned by the unit about their writings on the alleged assets.
Authorities confiscated their passports and national ID cards, and then released them that same day.
Then on March 22, police arrested the two men after the public prosecutor's office concluded that the reports were untrue and pledged to investigate and prosecute those who disseminated them to harm the country, its institutions, its citizens and its judicial and financial systems.
The two bloggers stand accused of spreading false accusations against Ould Abdel Aziz under Article 348 of Mauritanias Penal Code.
They risk between six months to five years in jail each.
They remain in jail pending trial.
In an interview with Global Voices via WhatsApp, Nasser Wedaddy, the brother of Abderrahmane Weddady and a Global Voices community member, said that prosecutors have failed to present actual evidence against Abderrahmane and Ould Jiddou.
He also noted that their lawyers have found no actual evidence on file for the case.
He said: The prosecutor alleges that the evidence was lost.
It's his euphemism for we don't have any evidence to charge them, and we made it all up.
Since 2016, Abderrahmane Weddady had also been reporting and writing about a real estate scam, in which a man with alleged ties to the presidents family, fraudulently acquired ownership of houses of thousands of Mauritania to resell them, his brother Nasser Weddady said.
Jiddou also wrote about the scam on his Facebook page, his wife told Human Rights Watch.
Nasser Wedaddy also commented on this work:
My brother's 39-month investigation into the country's biggest ponzi scheme since its independence has been credited by many as a service to society.
He managed to uncover a swindle that ended up costing over 700 families their homes and savings.
He even uncovered how the current President is protecting and benefiting from the scam.
Freedom of expression is tightly restricted in Mauritania and the authorities often use criminal defamation laws to silence human rights activists, bloggers and journalists who speak out against the regime or expose government wrongdoing.
In a statement to Global Voices, the family of Abderrahmane Weddady demanded that both men be released and all charges against them dropped:
We demand the immediate and unconditional release of both Abderrahmane Weddady and Cheikh Ould Jiddou.
And the formal dismissal of any legal procedures against them, and a formal apology from the Mauritanian government for this gross and arbitrary subversion of the legal system to persecute political opponents.
Osama al-Najjar remains in detention, despite completing his jail sentence two years ago.

Emirati activist Osama al-Najjar remains in unlawful detention, despite having completed his three-year jail sentence more than two years ago.
Al-Najjar was arrested in March 2014 for posting tweets denouncing that his father had been tortured in prison, and calling for his release and that of other prisoners of conscience in the Emirates.
Osama's father, Hussain Al-Najjar, is one of 94 Emirati activists who were prosecuted en masse in 2013 for calling for political reform in the Emirates on charges related to harming State Security.
He is currently serving 11 years in prison.
In November 2014, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, sentenced Osama to three years in jail under the country's cybercrime law on a number of charges that include instigating hatred against the state and designing and running a website [with] satirical and defaming ideas and information.
He was due to be released on 17 March, 2017, but at the request of public prosecution, the court deemed him a threat to national security and extended his detention without specifying for how long.
Two year later, Osama remains behind bars, with no end to his detention in sight.
In a recent statement marking the anniversary of the end of his official sentence, the International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE said:
As there is no trial proceeding this form of detention, those transferred to such facilities can be held indefinitely with the government rather than the judiciary handing down punishment.
This type of administrative detention grossly violates international standards of due process.
Although he was not convicted of a terrorist offence, Osama is being held at a counselling centre at al-Razeen prison under the country's counter-terrorism law.
Emirati authorities claim that the purpose of these facilities is to offer guidance to those considered to be a threat against the state.
However, rights groups say that authorities are using counter-terrorism and these so-called counselling centres as a pretext to indefinitely extend the detention of prisoners of conscience.

Six students were detained on Tuesday, March 12, in Kirundo province in northeast Burundi for scribbling on pictures of President Pierre Nkurunziza in five textbooks.
The students were accused of insulting the head of state.
The National Federation of Associations Engaged in Children's Welfare in Burundi (FENADEB) reported that another student, 13, had been immediately released because he was a minor under the age of 15.
Three students were reportedly provisionally released on Friday, March 15, but, the remaining three were kept in custody.
The girls, aged 15 to 17, if found guilty, risk up to five years in prison for insulting the president.
Iwacu newspaper reported that families affected were deeply distressed.
Scribbling [on the presidents picture] is a punishable offense under the Burundian law, according to a Reuters report.
However, the age of the offenders may serve as a mitigating circumstance in these students trial.
As a teacher anonymously noted, the textbooks had not been checked for several years and are often shared by students, so it is difficult to know who marked them.
A similar episode occurred in 2016, following the controversy over the presidents third term, where high school students scribbled on textbook pictures of Nkurunziza.
Authorities took this as a serious insult and expelled hundreds of students from various schools across the country.
Eleven students were charged with insulting the head of state and threatening state security, although they were reportedly later cleared.
These actions were highly criticized.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement on June 29, 2016:
I am dismayed by continuing reports of the suspension and arrest of schoolchildren and students for having scribbled on pictures of the president in textbooks.
Nkurunziza, the eternal supreme guide
President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi.

Pierre Nkurunziza has been president of Burundi since 2005.
In 2015, he was controversially nominated by his party for a third term in office.
In March last year, Nkurunziza was named eternal supreme guide by his political party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD).
Evariste Ndayishimiye, CNDD-FDDs secretary general explained why that title was conferred on Nkurunziza:
He is our leader.
Therefore in our party no one is comparable to him.
He is our parent; he is the one who advises us.
That is why I ask all our members to respect that because a home without the man (its head) can be overlooked by anybody.
For us, we have the best.
While the CNDD-FDD downplayed the title, Nkurunzizas reinforced status as the eternal supreme guide has made it difficult for anyone to disagree with his choices, including his move to change the two-term limit enshrined in the countrys constitution.
This reflects a centralization of power in the ruling party around Nkurunziza and supporters, and of the partys control of state institutions.
Scribblers in solidarity
Netizens have taken to scribbling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in protest through two hashtags: #Nkurunziza and #Burundi:
Burundians online are scribbling in protest, doodling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in reaction to the arrest of three school girls who were detained for drawing over the picture of the President on their school books.

Crackdown on criticism
Burundi's government has become increasingly sensitive to criticism since 2015, after a failed coup, clashes with rebel groups, criticisms of rights abuses, sanctions, economic hardships and a refugee crisis.
Nkurunzizas third term bid was opposed by the European Union, and the United Nations, who demanded a restoration of stability before elections.
Faced with these challenges, a siege mentality hardened and authorities clamped down more harshly on perceived threats.
The Human Rights Watch May 2018 special report discovered that Burundian state security forces, intelligence services, and members of the ruling partys youth league, the Imbonerakure, carried out brutal, targeted attacks on opponents or suspected opponents, human rights activists, and journalists, killing an estimated 1,700 people and forcibly disappearing, raping, torturing, beating, arbitrarily detaining, and intimidating countless others.
This has led to a refugee crisis that has seen Burundians fleeing particularly to Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda.
While thousands have returned, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded over 347,000 total Burundian refugees in February 2019
UNHCR asserts:
[P]olitical unrest in Burundi took a deadly turn in 2015 after the president announced plans to seek a third term.
Street protests led to violent clashes, and hundreds of thousands fled to nearby countries in search of safety.
Earlier this month, Burundi closed the United Nations human rights office after 23 years, saying it was no longer needed.
The government was incensed with former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who described Nkurunzizas Burundi as one of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times in February 2018.
Media outlet closures, harassment of opponents, and clampdowns on NGOs and restrictions in political space for alternative narratives and arguments.
For example, rights activist Germain Rukiki who documented acts of torture committed by Nkurunzizas regime was sentenced to 32 years in jail in 2018 for participation in an insurrectional movement, undermining state security and rebellion.
Rukiki's trial was also marred by irregularities and came weeks before the controversial constitutional referendum.
The scribbling affair is also indicative of the governments increasingly conservative, moralizing approach, including mandatory marriages for cohabiting non-married couples in 2017, clampdowns on prostitution and begging.

Nigeria will hold a presidential election on February 16, 2019, and all eyes are on this election as a test to prove the strength of Nigeria's democratic norms, values and unity.
This year, there are five main candidates in the race out of 73 total presidential candidates.
Two major contenders include the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari (All Progressive Congress) and the opposition candidate and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar (Peoples Democratic Party).
The other three candidates, Obiageli Ezekwesili, Kingsley Moghalu and Omoyole Sowore, have been termed the third force because they lack political experience but still present significant competition.
Amid the cacophony of electoral campaigns and the attendant passion from supporters both online and offline here are the key issues that may get lost in the noise.

Old and the strongman syndrome
Nigeria's two major contenders, Buhari, 76, and Atiku, 72, both have long histories of political engagement in Nigeria, leaving many to question their health and longevity as presidential hopefuls.
With the end of longtime rulers like South African President Jacob Zuma, 76, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, 94, who was forced out of power after 37 years as president, it has felt like an end to regimes led by the old and strong men in Africa.
But this hope has not lasted. Paul Biya, 84, was re-elected as president of Cameroon, making him the oldest political leader in sub-Saharan Africa.
The health of Nigerias leaders became a major political consideration after late President Umaru Musa YarAdua died in office on May 5, 2010.
YarAdua's illness and continued absence created a power vacuum because he did not hand it over to his deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, before he traveled abroad for treatment.
Incumbent President Buhari has made about ten trips to the United Kingdom for medical treatment of an undisclosed ailment.
He has spent more than 170 days in London on official medical leave since becoming president in 2015, according to the New York Times.
Can younger candidates stand a better chance?
This year, there are 10 candidates under the age of 40 and 16 candidates between the ages of 45-49.
But younger candidates may not fare well because Nigerias long history of military rule has embedded a culture of political actors who have both the clout and wealth to fund party politics and this takes time and connections to cultivate.
Buhari and Abubakar both have strong political bases.
Buhari has a loyal following in the northern part of the country, while Abubakar is perceived as widely accepted across different tribes and religions in the country.
Their ages do not appear to be a factor in garnering support and loyalty.
Ethnicity and religion
Nigeria is what's known as an ethnic fault line state ethnicity and religion have long played a central role in elections and general politics.
The 2015 elections showed that the two major contestants received bloc votes from their various states and geopolitical zones, according to an article in the Journal of African Elections.
Also, ethnic sentiments were used to appeal to voters.
Ethnocentric hate speech surged both online and offline, before and after the 2015 presidential elections.
Similarly, in 2017, some Nigerian writers raised alarm over the vile ethnic hate speech that almost consumed the nation.
Former President Goodluck Jonathan lost in the polls over his failure to handle the Islamic militant group Boko Haram's bombings that rattled the nation and caused widespread insecurity.
Boko Haram's abduction of schoolgirls in Chibok led to a global outcry of #BringBackOurGirls when it was clear to citizens that the government was not doing enough to intervene.
Buhari and Abubakar will both rely on ethnic alliances to win votes.
Buhari, a northerner (Fulani/Muslim), has retained Yemi Osibanjo as his vice-presidential candidate in order to garner votes from the southwestern (Yoruba/Christian) part of the country.
Abubakar, a northerner (Fulani/Muslim) has picked his vice-presidential candidate from the southeastern (Igbo/Christian) part of the country.
Because Buhari and Abubakar are from the same ethnoreligious group, tensions may not be as high as they were in 2015 elections when Jonathan Goodluck, a southern minority Ijaw Christian, ran against Buhari.
Free speech and press freedom
Buhari's administration has been accused of major human rights violations and many hashtags have trended on social media in 2018 calling for the release of detained netizens and journalists.
On March 17, 2016, Nigerian journalist Yomi Olomofe was brutally assaulted and detained by Nigerian police in an attack against free speech.
Nigerian journalist Daniel Elombah and his brother, Timothy Elombah, were arrested on New Year's Day 2017 for a story they did not even write.
In August that year, Nigerian trader Joe Fortemose Chinakwe was arrested by for naming his pet dog Buhari.
Jones Abiri, publisher of Weekly Source, was arrested on July 21, 2016, by state security (DSS) agents at his office in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.
#FreeJonesAbiri trended for several days on Twitter until Abiri was released on August 15, 2018, after a two-year detention.
#FreeSamuelOgundipe trended when Nigerian journalist Samuel Ogundipe was detained for three days by Nigerias Special Tactical Squad after refusing to name his sources for a story concerning the forceful prevention of lawmakers by security agents from entering the Nigerian National Assembly in early August 2018.
Deji Adeyanju, a political activist and member of the opposition party, was re-arrested in December 2018 and has been in detention since then due to a fresh petition.
Buhari has openly expressed his aversion to a free press and freedom of speech.
In an address to lawyers last year, he stated that the rule of law must be subject to the supremacy of the nations security and national interest.
On the other hand, Abubakar has promised to run an inclusive governance structure that will harness Nigeria's diversity and uphold a just and fair environment where the rights of all citizens are protected by a transparent government.
Only time will tell how these issues will unfold throughout the election period and beyond.

Photo by Wikimedia user Basil D Soufi [CC BY-SA 3.0].When Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, it cast a long shadow on the exercise of free speech for journalists from Saudi Arabia and across the Arab region.
The resulting political fallout also shook some of the most powerful institutions and voices in Islam.
After the circumstances of Khashoggi's disappearance and death came to light, multiple world leaders openly accused Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman of ordering the journalist's murder.
In what appeared to be a response to these accusations, the Imam of the Grand mosque in Mecca delivered a Friday sermon on October 19 in which he exalted Bin Salman, the Kingdom's de facto ruler.
Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sudais lauded the modernizing reforms of Bin Salman and denounced attacks against these blessed lands in his sermon, which was pre-approved by Saudi authorities.
He went on to conclude that it [was] the solemn duty of all Muslims to support and obey the king and the faithful crown prince, the protectors and guardians of the holy sites and Islam.
Responding in a opinion piece for the New York Times, UCLA School of Law professor Khaled M. Abou El Fadl said the sermon had desecrated and defiled the podium of the prophet.
By using the Grand Mosque to whitewash acts of despotism and oppression, he wrote, Prince Mohammed has placed the very legitimacy of the Saudi control and guardianship of the holy places of Mecca and Medina in question.
Saudi Arabia's long history of politics in religion
With its theocratic system of governance, this is not uncommon in the ultraconservative kingdom.
In fact, Saudi leaders have long used religion as a tool of political power since the Kingdom's inception.
Saudi Arabia is home to Islams two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina.
Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca to perform Hajj or pilgrimage, one of Islam's five pillars.
This has allowed the Saudi government to claim a special form of religious legitimacy in Islam.
The Kingdom has exploited this legitimacy to gain and maintain political power.
When the first Saudi state was established in 1744, Muhammad ibn Saud, emir of the small oasis town of Diriya, made a pact with religious leader and theologian Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.
Abd al-Wahhab started an ultraconservative religious movement (today known as Wahhabism) based on an austere interpretation of Quran and prophetic traditions.
Fanack, an independent media and analysis site focused on the MENA region, explains that the union was intended to create an Islamic realm ruled by a strict interpretation of Islam.
This first Saudi state collapsed decades later, and a second state was established in 1824, only to collapse again in 1891.
In 1924 and 1925, the Ibn-Saud family invaded Mecca and Medina (Islams two holiest cities) respectively, with the help of Wahhabi fighters.
In 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established.
Ever since, Saudi rulers have continued to use religion to serve their political interests.
Voices challenging official religious discourse silenced
Today, the kingdom's history is at the top of mind for many Saudis as they grapple with rising levels of repression under the leadership of Mohammad Bin Salman.
Religious clerics are enlisted to treat those who denounce rights violations or call for reform as enemies of Islam, and state authorities continue to deploy religious discourse to serve the political interests of rulers.
In January 2019, Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs Abdullatif Ibn Abdulaziz Al-Sheikh condemned the Arab uprisings of 2011 and 2012, describing them as poisonous and destructive to the Arab and Muslim human.
In an implicit reference to criticism targeted at the kingdom after Khashoggi's murder, the Minister denounced what he described as unjust attacks from the enemies of Islam and accused Muslims who are critical of the kingdom and its policies of spreading sedition, bringing discord, and inciting against their rulers and leaders.
Reflecting on the link between Wahhabism and political oppression, Saudi human rights activist Yahya Assiri, who lives in exile in London, tweeted on January 13
Oppression is a comprehensive system, and [in our country] it is enabled by religion.
When Ibn Saud and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab allied, Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism grew as a malignant twin.
Our country will not survive unless we get rid of the Saudi Wahhabi oppression.
As we have said this, others, with a good intention, have said that Wahhabism is a religious movement, while it is purely political
But the voices of people like Assiri are silenced in Saudi Arabia.
Another such voice is that of Abdullah Al-Hamid, one of the founders of the now-dissolved Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), who is currently behind bars.
Al-Hamid is serving eleven years in prison for his human rights activities, on charges that include breaking allegiance to and disobeying the ruler, and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations.
He was convicted in 2013 by the infamous Specialized Criminal Court, established to try terror-related cases but often used to go after human rights activists.
Rights groups reported that Al-Hamid began a hunger strike on 17 February.
In a statement attributed to him and published by the MBS MeToo human rights platform, Al-Hamid announced that hes demanding the release of imprisoned human rights activists and political prisoners.

In addition to his human rights activism, Al-Hamid is a poet and an academic.
In his writings, he has used Islamic texts and traditions to call for democratic reforms, advocate for human rights, and to critique the religious institutions that enable repression in Saudi Arabia such as the Council of Senior Scholars, the kingdoms highest religious body which advises the king on religious matters.
He once accused the Council of serving to support those who steal the peoples money, dignity and freedom and of playing a role in harming citizenship, plurality, tolerance and producing violence and extremism.
He also has advocated for a modern religious discourse that embraces a consultative rule and he opposed what he described as the common religious discourse in the kingdom which calls for prayer behind a unjust Imameven if he violated [one's] freedom, justice and equality.
Crackdown on independent clerics
While silencing those who challenge the government's official discourse, Saudi Arabia has also taken a hard line against clerics who are not sufficiently supportive of the Crown Prince's policies and actions.
Saudi clerics Sheikh Salman Al-Awda, Ali Al-Omari and Sheikh Awad Al-Qarni were all arrested in September 2017 on various charges that include their alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Rights groups say the charges were brought on because the clerics did not vocally support the severance of diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies.
And all three may face the death penalty.
At 62, Sheikh Salman Al-Awda is a prominent cleric with a massive social media following, not only in Saudi Arabia but across the Arab region.
The combined number of his followers on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is more than 22 million.
He previously expressed support for the Arab uprisings of 2011 and called for democratic reforms in the kingdom and the region.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups linked his arrest to a tweet posted on 8 September, in which he reacted to news reports of a potential reconciliation between the nations.
In the second part of the tweet, he wrote: May God harmonize between their hearts for what is good for their people.
Ali Al-Omari is a religious scholar and the chairman of 4Shbab, a youth-focused Islamic TV channel.
In contrast to others, he was not vocal on political issues in the Kingdom.
He even once tweeted in support of the Kingdoms leaders, and posted a tweet praying for Bin Salmans success when he was appointed crown prince back in June 2017.
Sheikh Awad Al-Qarni faces a number of accusations that include supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, outlawed in Saudi Arabia, and slandering the Kingdom, its policies and its systems.
Several other clerics are also currently behind bars in Saudi Arabia.
Some have called for democratic reforms in the kingdom, like Al-Awda, while others voiced opposition to Bin Salmans policies or social reforms.
Others like al-Omari previously expressed support to Saudi rulers and the Crown Prince.
What these cases confirm is that under Bin Salmans de facto-rule, silence is no longer enough.
Beyond a mandate to stamp out independent voices the words of anyone who is not writing in service of the Kingdom's leadership or political agenda clerics must go the extra mile and outwardly praise the Crown Prince and Saudi leadership.
The opinions and ideologies of those prisoners of conscience currently behind bars in Saudi Arabia, including womens rights defenders, human rights defenders, Shia protesters and religious clerics, may vary.
But under the de facto rule of Bin Salman, these individuals are all subject to injustices at the hands of Saudi authorities including arbitrary detention, solitary confinement, torture, and enforced disappearance.
To legitimise and whitewash these acts of oppression, Saudi rulers never hesitate to use religion as a cover-up.
According to the Cuban government, 20,000 doctors attended 113 million Brazilians in the last five years.

Thousands of Brazilians could be left without healthcare as Cuba begins pulling out 8,400 doctors who have been stationed in the country's smallest and remotest towns for the past five years.
In an official statement dated November 14, Havana announced it will end its agreement with Brazil as a response to president-elect Jair Bolsonaro's public comments about the program, which it deemed threatening and depreciative.
On multiple occasions over the course of the presidential campaign, Bolsonaro has disputed the skills of the Cuban doctors and criticized the agreement's terms.
Launched in 2013 by former president Dilma Rousseff, the program Mais Médicos (More Doctors) sought to widen healthcare access in Brazil's most vulnerable towns, some of which never had a resident doctor before.
It opened thousands of job posts in those areas, offering salaries of around 3,500 dollars per month plus a stipend for housing and meals (for comparison, Brazil's minimum wage is currently around 300 dollars per month).
The program gave preference to Brazilian doctors, but after they've signed up for only six percent of the job openings, the remaining vacancies were filled by Cuban doctors who were brought in through a deal signed by Brazil's Ministry of Health and Havana and mediated by WHO's Pan American Health Organisation.
By the agreement's terms, Brazil doesn't hire the Cuban doctors directly: instead, it pays the Cuban government, who recruits, manages and compensates them as civil servants with a salary that is around 25 percent of what Brazil would pay them had they been hired individually.

The deal met plenty of criticism since the first doctors began to arrive.
They were booed in airports by massive crowds and were called slaves in protests led by Brazilian medical associations.
Bolsonaro himself, at the time a congressman at the Chamber of Deputies, went to the Supreme Court demanding the program's suspension.
Both during his time as congressman and the presidential race, he repeatedly said that the program was slave work.
He's promised to send the doctors back to Cuba with the strike of a pen so that they could assist the the members of the Workers Party who will soon be sent to Guantanamo.
In a TV interview in July 2018, he said that no one has any proof of whether [the Cuban doctors] have any knowledge of medicine.
In its official pull out statement, Havana's said:
The Brazilian people who made the More Doctors program a success, who trusted the Cuban doctors from the beginning, who appreciated the respectful, sensitive and professional treatment they received will understand who is responsible for our doctors being unable to continue providing support in the country.
Bolsonaro responded on his social media channels that Havana simply didnt want to accept new terms: to relay the full salary back to its doctors and that they'd validate their medical diplomas in Brazil through an exam.
He called it an irresponsible decision by the Cuban dictatorship for disregarding the impact it would have on the lives of Brazilians.
As journalist Leonardo Sakamoto writes, this could lead to the first social crisis in Bolsonaros government, and one that's unfolding even before he takes office.
Cubans make up 45 percent of the More Doctors professionals.
Around 28 percent of Brazil's cities served by the program only count with one resident Cuban doctor.
Around 90 percent of the doctors working in indigenous areas in Brazil are Cubans.
Brazil problems, Cuban solutions
Five years ago, Brazil had a deficit of 54,000 doctors in its public health system.
The country had 1,8 doctors for every 1,000 inhabitants.
For comparison, that rate is currently of 2,5 in the United States and 7,5 in Cuba.
Small towns in Brazil have always struggled to attract medical professionals, who complain about the lack of infrastructure.
Brazil also doesn't train enough doctors to serve its 200-million population.
The small socialist nation, on the other hand, has doctors to spare.
Currently, Cuba has 50,000 health workers stationed in 67 countries.
Leasing of medical experts is Cuban's main export: they generate 11 billion US dollars in revenue to the state per year, more than tourism does.

Cuba has sent its first medical brigade abroad in 1963, after the independence war in Algeria.
Since then, according to a story by Radio Ambulante, almost 500,000 Cuban physicians have worked in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Over the years, a few Cubans have told the Brazilian press that they felt exploited.
Some have joined lawsuits against both governments as well as the WHO.
Others have reported threats made by their government.
However, many said in a podcast by Radio Ambulante that, even with Havana's retention of 75 percent of the wages, they don't think the salary is unfair.
The results
A study by the Federal University of Minas Gerais, which interviewed 14 thousand patients in 700 cities one year after More Doctors began, revealed a high level of satisfaction with the program: 85 percent said that healthcare in their regions were better or a lot better.
The participants highlighted poor infrastructure and the lack of medicines as unresolved problems.
Another study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) shows that the program helped the government to reduce a third of its expenses with hospitalizations.
Débora Mazetto, one of the economists who led the study, told BBC Brazil:
There has been an improvement on the quality of the services offered to the population.
Can you imagine a community that never had a doctor?
With the rising numbers of appointments in areas that were complete unassisted before, it's now possible to identify and treat diseases faster, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations.
What next?
Since November 14, over 200 doctors have already returned to Cuba.
The Pan American Health Organization expects that all of them will have returned by December 12.
In many public clinics, people have found themselves without medical care this past week or were told that they'd only have a doctor available once a week from now on.
Although the Brazilian government claims that 92 percent of the spots left vacant by the Cubans have already been filled, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo said this number might not mean much at the end of the day:
In 2017, the Health Ministry opened a call to select Brazilians to More Doctors.
In total, 6,285 applied to 2,320 openings, but only 1,626 showed up to work.
Around 30 percent left their jobs before completing one year on them.
As with many social programs in Brazil, More Doctors did have its gray areas, but it also dramatically changed public health in regions that were completely forgotten by the Brazilian state.
Perhaps the greatest challenge so far for the next government-elect is to learn from its mistakes and where it got it right.
How, and if, Bolsonaros government will ensure healthcare is available in those regions is still to be seen.

Human rights groups and activists are urging the Iraqi parliament to withdraw a controversial cybercrime bill that would greatly restrict freedom of expression online, if adopted.
The bill imposes long prison sentences for speech-related offences that are only vaguely defined in the text of the bill.
Article 3 prescribes a lifetime prison sentence and steep fines for those convicted of using computers and the internet to undermine the independence, the integrity and safety of the country, or its supreme economic, political, military, or security interests or to provoke sectarian strife, disturbing the security and public order, or harming the reputation of the country.
Articles 4 and 6 impose the same punishments for those convicted of promoting terrorist acts and ideas (Art.4) or publish[ing] or broadcast[ing] false or misleading facts with the intention of weakening confidence in the electronic financial system (Art.6.)
Earlier this year, the Gulf Centre for Human Rights warned:
Without a clear and explicit definition of terrorism, it would be easy to use the law to liquidate the resources of political opponents and other activists.
Internet-related rights are already on shaky ground in Iraq.
Last summer, authorities responded to protests denouncing corruption and dire living conditions in Basra and other cities by shutting down the internet.
If adopted, the bill will only make it harder for Iraqis to exercise their rights to communicate, speak freely and access information online.
Earlier this month, nine human rights groups including AccessNow, Amnesty International and the the Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights published a statement urging the Iraqi parliament to withdraw the bill:
the law will result in Internet users becoming fearful of exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms online, and will empty the right to freedom of expression of its substance.
The law would also have far-reaching effects on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of information as well as the right to participation in public affairs in Iraq.
The parliament was scheduled to debate the bill on March 14, but it was later removed from the day's schedule.
On Twitter, the official account for the Iraqi Council of Representatives thanked those who contacted it to criticise some laws, but did not specify which laws.
Rights groups and activists welcomed this response, but they remain wary.
Small victory: Campaigning by human rights activists, journalists on #Iraq and local and Intl NGOs successfully removed the draft cybercrime law from @parliamentiqs schedule.
Next step, withdraw the draft law altogether!
It remains unclear if the parliament will introduce changes to the bill or when it will be scheduled for debate again.

Since December 2018, protests in Sudan that sparked over the tripled price of bread have turned into nationwide protests against the nearly three-decade rule regime of Omar Al Bashir.
Finally, on Thursday, April 11, 2019, Bashir was forced to step down.
AL-BASHIR IS OUT, WE DID IT !!!
#Sudan
Bashir's government has used repressive tactics and measures to quell the protests.
More than 40 protesters have been killed, hundreds detained and tortured.
The brutal response did not stop women from placing themselves firmly at the heart of the protests.
There is no amount of beating or detention that could make us stop.
These women and many more like them, are leading the huge protests against Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.#SudanProtests
Today in Sudan we walk for women.
Incarcerated women.
Revolutionary women.
Oppressed women.
Refugee women.
War torn women, raped, battered and beat women.
Women who are too loud and too brave for a country made for men.
They lead the march chanting a Zagrouda, an ululation commonly used by women in the Arab world to express celebration.
Zagrouda (or the womens chant) has become the calling code for every protest in the street.
When people hear these womens voices, they know its the revolution call and that its time to start their march.
During the month of March, women wore the traditional white thobe in support of the protests and women's rights.
Social media platforms filled with pictures of female protesters wearing the white robe, using the hashtag #whitemarch (#_)
Happy International Womens Day.
Impact Hub Khartoum Family
Women who protest regularly face police brutality.
Authorities have fired tear gas and live ammunition and have even threatened with rape.
Women have also reportedly been beaten, their faces have been branded and their hair cut off inside detention centers.
Every day new footage of Sudanese women getting beaten and humiliated circulates on social media:
Excessive brutality against elderly and women by police force in Khartoum North
But the same hashtags are also used to show the bravery of women in Sudan.
#SupportSudan

#Sudan ese girls and women have shown bravery beyond belief during the #Sudanuprising.
This week, a photo and a video from the protests have gone viral.
A 22-year-old engineering and architecture student named Alaa Salah raised her right arm as she led the crowd in a chant called Thawra (Arabic for revolution).
The video and photo would end up going viral and Sudanese activists are now referring to her as Kandaka, the title given to Nubian queens of ancient Sudan.
Dont know her name, but this Woman in #Sudan is leading rallies, standing on car roofs, and pleading for change against autocratic Bashir.
Here she is singing Thawra (Revolution).
Illustrations shared on social networks transformed Salah into the Sudanese Statue of Liberty.
If one day I have a #daughter, I want her to be just like her #AlaaSalah 22 year old engineering and architecture student chanting and leading protest in #Khartoum she is now a symbol of #Sudanese #Revolution and became the voice of #WomenRevolutions #Sudan #WomenLove #Peace
From the streets to the screen
Behind the screen, Facebook groups once dominated by conversations about marriage and crushes are now used to expose police brutality.
The women in these groups disclose videos and pictures of abusive security forces.
When the identity is revealed, the agent concerned is often beaten up and chased out of town.
The impact of these groups is remarkable many security agents are now hiding their faces.
The Sudanese authorities have tried to block social media in the country, but the women bypass the blockade by using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), which can hide a user's location.
A revolution is never complete without art:

Happy womens day .. To all the revolutionary phenomenal women out there .. keep up your ; )
A post shared by Alaa Satir (@alaasatir)
Female painters, digital artists, and musicians have produced works of art to complement street protests.
They use art to honor the endurance of the people, especially women.
They make art to document the events and portraits of the victims and depict the reality of living under an oppressive system.
Women are front, left and center of the revolution.
When people started protesting, they were like, Women should stay at home.
But we were like no said Islam Elbeiti a 24-year-old jazz bass player.
Fighting for women's rights in Sudan
On March 12, the emergency court of appeals in Sudan, amid pressure from families of the women who rallied outside the courthouse, scrapped the flogging punishment of nine female Sudanese protesters that were sentenced to 20 lashes and one month in prison for rioting.
Flogging is a common form of punishment particularly for women in Sudan they risk flogging for crimes like indecent clothing or adultery.
In 2014, a woman was sentenced to death for marrying a non-Muslim, which is considered adultery.
In 2015, a woman was lashed 75 times for marrying a man without her father's consent.
In 2017, 24 women were arrested for wearing trousers, a violation of the country's strict Shari'a Law.
Sometimes the brutality goes beyond flogging: Many Sudanese women have been sentenced to death by stoning.
According to Reuters, Bashir defended his position on strict adherence to Shari'a law in Sudan in 2011:
We want to present a constitution that serves as a template to those around us.
And our template is clear, a 100 percent Islamic constitution, without communism or secularism or Western (influences).
The Sudanese Penal code, which is based on an interpretation of the Shari'a (Islamic Law) allows girls as young as 10 to get married, and states that a woman's rape by her husband cannot be qualified as such.
On top of that, women have to face morality laws that chain them and oppress them on a daily basis.
For this reason, Sudanese women are on the front lines of the protests, fighting for change.
Cyclone Idai devastates Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa with massive flooding, rocks, and mudslides.
Image of flooding in Mozambique, shared widely on social media.
Tropical Cyclone Idai has left a devastating trail of destruction and death after sweeping through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa.
At least 162 people have lost their lives so far in the devastating storm across region.
In Mozambique, the city of Beira has been nearly entirely wiped out.
At least 89 people have died in Zimbabwe alone, amid fears of a higher figure, in Manicaland's Chimanimani district, located 406 kilometers east of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, as homes and bridges were swept away by a tropical storm that began on Friday.
More than 300 people are missing according to the government.
The United Nations in Zimbabwe said that more than 8,000 people have been affected by the flooding in the eastern parts of the country.
Sadly lives have been lost and properties destroyed, United Nations Zimbabwe said in a tweet:
According to the government, Cyclone Idai hit the Ngangu Township are in Chimanimani the hardest where most lives were lost.
Over a hundred houses were damaged by falling mud and rocks.
The storm originated in the Indian Ocean and led to a torrential rainstorm which commenced in Mozambique on Thursday, with wind speeds of about 160 kilometers per hour, reportedly causing ocean waves of up to 9 meters high.
The police and military have been deployed to assist in the evacuation of victims.
Visibility, according to the Information ministry, has significantly improved and this will help airforce helicopters to evacuate more people.
Local government minister July Moyo said that bodies are currently being seen floating in rivers and nothing much can be done at the moment.
Roads, bridges and telephones are currently cut off and hundreds of homes destroyed.
Country director for the International Red Cross (IRC) Zimbabwe Paolo Cernuschi said the IRC teams in Zimbabwe are trying to reach communities affected by the cyclone but the infrastructure damage is severe and the teams couldn't reach Chimanimani or Chipinge.
Urgent road repairs in progress so we will try again in the morning, said Cernuschi.
The Zimbabwe government held an inter-ministerial committee on Sunday morning and subsequently set up 10 subcommittees to deal with hard-hit areas.
Committees will deal with areas related to food security, resource mobilization, safety and shelter, transport, water and sanitation among other critical areas.
An official with the Meteorological Services Department said that the cyclone has weakened greatly and shifted from eastern to northeastern areas of Zimbabwe.
Up to 200 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in Chipinge [located in eastern Zimbabwe], 118 millimeters north of Chipinge, and 102 millimeters in Buhera [southeastern Zimbabwe], said the official.
He warned that the eastern highlands of the country should still expect floods due to the torrential rains and advised the public to avoid traveling there.
Not much precipitation was expected on Monday, with light rainfall and better weather conditions expected to commence on Monday.
Recovery efforts will be long term and relief efforts are underway.

Via YouTube.
The Democratic Republic of Congos constitutional court announced last month Felix Tshisekedi as the country's newly elected president, rejecting a legal challenge filed by runner-up Martin Fayulu who claims the vote was fraudulent.
The DR Congo held fiercely contested general elections in late December 2018 after the incumbent, President Joseph Kabila, who ruled for 18 years, was constitutionally barred from running for a third term.
The election was anticipated to be the DR Congos first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence, but has been mired in controversy since the December 30 vote.
Frontrunner Martin Fayulu of the Engagement for Citizenship and Development party.filed a court challenge claiming the votes to be rigged against him.
He and others believe a deal was made by Tshisekedi of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, or UDSP, and President Kabila of the ruling Common Front for Congo party, or FCC.
On January 19, 2019, the court rejected Fayulus request for failure to prove his assertions beyond a reasonable doubt.
According to the Independent National Electoral Commission, Tshisekedi received 38.5 percent of the vote while Martin Fayulu, of the Lamuka opposition alliance, obtained 34.7 percent and loyal hardliner Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary garnered 23.8 percent.
Voter participation was less than half at around 47.6 percent.
Following the announcement, celebrations commenced at party headquarters in Kinshasa, the capital.
Among several heads of state in Africa, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa congratulated Tshisekedi and the United Republic of Tanzania's President John Magufuli also tweeted his congratulations.
Despite initial disagreement among African Union members about the election outcome, the AU has welcomed Tshisekedi, who gave his maiden speech to the union on February 10 to warm reception.
But two months after the disputed elections, many fear that this transition of power was staged carefully to ensure that Kabila holds onto power through backstage agreements with Tshisekedi.
Who is Tshisekedi?
Félix Antoine Tshilombo Tshisekedi was born in Léopoldville on June 13, 1963.
His father, Etienne Tshisekedi, dominated Congolese politics as the founder of UDPS the largest opposition party.
Due to his fathers opposition politics, the family was exiled internally to their home town, Kasai, and in the 1980s,
Tshisekedi traveled with his father to Belgium, where he earned a diploma in accounting in 1987.
He earned several other degrees between 1991-2001 and worked in marketing.
While in Belgium, Tshisekedi turned to politics, like his father, and became the national secretary for external relations of the UDPS in 2008.
In November 2011, he planned to represent the city of Mbuji Mayi in Kasai but did not take his seat, citing a deceitful election.
His father was supposed to take on a leadership role as Kabila transitioned out of power, but upon his fathers death on February 1, 2017, son Felix Tshisekedi was elected to lead the UDPS, thrusting into him a powerful leadership role.
The people's soldier opposition woes linger
Tshisekedis victory may bring peace to the DRC or explode into turmoil, depending on whether or not Fayulu, who firmly rejected the election results, can accept this transition of power.
Fayulu called the election results a constitutional coup detat and electoral swindle.
In a January 14 statement from the Roman Catholic Church, one of the few trusted institutions in DR Congo, they said:
The results of the presidential election published by [the electoral commission] do not match those collected by our observer mission.
It is no secret that you have elected me president, Fayulu announced to the public, considering himself the only legitimate president of DR Congo.
Fayulu has been involved in campaigns for multi-party democracy and organized protests to this effect in 2016 and 2017.
Francesca Bomboko, director of Berci International, a research and consulting group in DR Congo, told the BBC that Fayulu has often shown up at protests to oppose Kabila.
Fayulu has reportedly said that the Congolese call him [the] people's soldier.
When Fayulu was nominated as the joint opposition candidate for 2019, Albert Moleka, Etienne Tshisekedi's former chief of staff, told the BBC that Fayulu could become the new Etienne Tshisekedi, saying hes the one who embodies the real opposition.
With the support of former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi, the former governor of the mineral-rich Katanga province, Fayulu seems to be rising in influence and power in DR Congo politics.
With no full support from party ranks, Tshisekedis victory came as a surprise.
According to the International Crisis Group, the UDSP split into several factions, some of which rejected the transfer of leadership to Etienne's son Tshisekedi.
Felix Tshisekedi is also somewhat of a novice in the political arena.
Tshisekedi has been criticized for his lack of charisma and political experience in high office, drawing his political legitimacy from his father, according to Simon Allison of the Mail & Guardian.
On the other hand, Tshisekedi is more diplomatic, conciliatory and attentive to people, a member of the Congolese opposition said.
He has promised to build a nation of unity, peace and security.
Tshisekedi said on January 20 that the court's confirmation of his win was a victory for the entire country.
It is Congo that won.
I am engaged in a campaign to reconcile all Congolese.
Congo wont be of division, hatred or tribalism.
It will be a reconciled Congo, a strong Congo focusing on development, peace and security.
Patrick Litanga, a Ph.D. student at American University in Washington DC., speaking to Al Jazeera, observed that Tshiesekedis win may be the beginning of a new political landscape:
Felix Tshisekedi will be the first president in the Congolese political history since the time of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba to face a serious countervailing power.
We may be witnessing the genesis of political checks and balances.
DR Congos future hinged on difficult past
DR Congo gained independence in 1960.
Since then, citizens have been subjected to numerous human rights violations such as extrajudicial killings; torture, sexual and gender-based violence including rapes and abductions.
Uppsala Conflict Data Project concluded that Laurent Kabilas government saw the next three highest conflict death rates respectively, with 13,884 in 1998, 8,019 in 1999, and 7,537 in 2000.
Will the new epoch of Felix Tshisekedi government end the turmoil or stir up it?
Lets wait.
Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela [Image credit: Committee to Protect Journalists]One month after Ghanaian investigative journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela was shot dead in his car in Madina, Ghana, activists are calling for answers and insights into the circumstances of his gruesome death.
The group United Press for Development staged a peaceful solidarity walk in Accra in mid-February as a message to police that Divelas killers have not yet been identified or convicted.
They say that walks will continue until the group gets answers.
Divelas killing calls attention to press freedom in Ghana where violent killings of journalists are actually rare, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Yet, Kofi Asante, the groups organiser, says that his group recorded 31 journalists being murdered in Kumasi, some of them were killed in 2018 and the irony is Ghana has been accredited as the number one country in press freedom in Africa and 23rd in the world.
Who was Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela?
Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela worked with Tiger Eye Private Investigations, an investigative journalism outlet led by Anas Aremeyaw Anas.
Their unconventional and controversial approach to investigative journalism has exposed many high profile people across Africa.
Divela had recently contributed to investigative work that exposed Kwesi Nyantakyi, former president of Ghanas football association, also a former member of FIFAs General Council, accused of accepting a bribe of $65,000 USD.
FIFA's adjudicatory council gave Nyantakyi a lifetime ban from all football-related activities.
Anas announced the murder of Divela in a tweet that included an attached video showing Ghanaian parliament member Kennedy Agyapong speaking live on TV in May 2018:
In September 2018, Divela told the Committee to Protect Journalists via WhatsApp that some powerful figures in Ghana sought to harm him after an image of him was published on NET 2 TV station in May 2018 by Agyapong.
Since my image was published and [the] public was incited against me [] many people have attempted [to attack me].
These criminals after us are people who are [] associated with powers that be in Ghana and can do anything and get away with it.
Indeed, it [has] been hinted in some quarters that the very man who published [my image] said he was doing everything possible to quell [my] existence.
MPs words have power
Agyapong, a member of the ruling New Patriotic Party, has served as an MP for 19 years.
In his fight against corruption, Agyapong is known for making bribery allegations against corrupt political officials especially those within his own party.
A debate ignited over whether or not Agyapongs remarks on live TV directed at Divela may have provoked his murder:
The boy is very dangerous.
He lives here in Madina.
If you meet him somewhere, break his ears.
If he ever comes to this premises [sic], I'm telling you, beat him.
Agyapong justified his actions and said his comments were not meant to provoke harm and referred to a skirmish. Divela allegedly once had with one of Agypongs staff members.
In another video, Agyapong suggests that Anas is actually a prime suspect in Divelas death.
He offered to pay a 100,000 Ghanaian Cedi reward (about 19,000 US dollars) for anyone who finds Divelas killers as proof that he did not call for his murder.
Agyapong left Ghana after police questioned him he strongly denied that he was fleeing Ghana or that he has been identified as a suspect.
Six people have been arrested and released on bail in connection with Divelas murder.
Police stated arrests were based on reasonable suspicion.
However, their identities have not yet been released.
Dangerous journalism
Tiger Eyes Investigations had been receiving death threats for several years and was accused of using unethical techniques that violate journalism ethics.
While there is no evidence to show that Agyapong had any direct connection to Divela's killing, his words do have power and were spoken on a TV station owned by him.
A CPJ report reveals that in 2018, about 53 journalists throughout the world were killed, 34 of whom were targeted for murder in reprisal for their work.
Between 2016 and 2017, 102 journalists were killed as a result of their work.
Over one thousand journalists were murdered in the last decade (2006-2017) according to a report by UNESCO.
The high profile assassination of The Washington Post columnist, Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, by agents of the Saudi government drew global ire.
Awil Dihar Salad, a veteran journalist in Somalia, was killed in December 2018.
Salad fled Somalia in 2005, fearing he could be targeted, but later returned and was then murdered.
Earlier in July 2018, three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic while investigating the activities of the so-called Wagner group, a group of private military contractors.
Engaging in investigative journalism can be like signing a death warrant.
Many African governments operate in opacity and they firmly resist attempts at exposure.
Considering the poor remuneration of journalists, it does not make sense for most journalists take this level of risk.
Yet, Divelas death is not forgotten and his work lives on.
Journalists and activists will keep walking until there is resolve.

In October 2019, Mozambique will elect its next president and its Congress for the sixth time since 1994 and will elect provincial governors for the first time in its history.
Although the race hasn't officially begun, it is generally expected that the eternal rivals of Mozambican politics will compete: Frelimo, the ruling party since 1994, and the largest opposition party, Renamo.
It will be the first time Renamo will compete without its historic leader Afonso Dhlakama, who has led the party for over four decades.
Dhlakama died on May 3, 2018, following a heart attack.
Dhlakama will be remembered as the Renamo leader who signed the General Peace Agreements of 1992 with former President Joaquim Chissano, which set Mozambique on the path towards democracy.
To succeed him, Renamo has chosen Ossufo Momade after he was elected by a party congress held in June 2018 in Gorongosa, the Renamo base located in the central Sofala province.
He will probably be the Renamo candidate in October, and will likely compete with the current president, Frelimo's Filip Nyusi, and Daviz Simango who presides another opposition party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM).
MDM was founded in 2009 and along with Renamo and Frelimo are the only parties that have representatives in the Assembly of the Republic or hold municipal offices.
Daviz Simango has run, and lost, two previous presidential elections.
The October vote will also happen amid a ceasefire signed in 2016 between an armed branch of Renamo and government forces, who have in recent years skirmished with each other in Mozambique's countryside.
In February 2019, the National Elections Commission (CNE) warned the public about the lack of financial resources to organize the nationwide poll.
Key dates
01/04 15/05: Voter registration
31/08 a 12/10: Campaign
15/10: Polling day
Perhaps most significantly of all, this is the first time Mozambicans will elect provincial governors.
Previously, they were nominated by the president.
The shift is the result of arduous and lengthy negotiations between Renamo and the government.
While the President hasn't yet sanctioned the law that will provide for this change, it is widely believed he will do so.
In his annual state of the union speech, Vladimir Putin promised Russians a faster, more reliable internet; it definitely won't be any freer, say experts.
On February 20, Vladimir Putin addressed the Russian parliament in his annual state of the union speech.
He pledged massive investments in social programs and civil infrastructure, notably the countys IT backbone:
This year we must adopt a master plan for developing the infrastructure of a digital economy, including telecommunications networks, as well as data storage and processing capacities.
Here we need to look ahead as well.
The task for the next few years is to provide universal access to high-speed internet and start using 5G communications networks.
Improving internet infrastructure and ensuring that all Russians are online may sound progressive.
But these developments will come about in an era of unprecedented online information control in Russia.
In February, two reports came out that noted a sharp, continuous downwards trend in online freedoms.
Indeed, it seems that while more Russians will have access to the internet, it will be an internet governed on the state's increasingly strict terms.
One study compiled by Agora, a human rights group, lays out the different ways the Russian authorities are clamping down on individual users, social networks and online media.
The most significant trend, Agora says, has been a wave of laws and regulations that force internet service providers and tech giants to police online content on the Russian government's behalf.
On more than one occasion, internet service providers have been forced to block access to websites for publishing information about court proceedings, or exposing government corruption.
In one high-profile case, providers were made to block access to the website of Alexey Navalny, a prominent opposition activist and anti-corruption campaigner.
Agora's report says:
The authorities are paving the way for blocking online services that they see as catalysts for mass protests, while attempting to present this crackdown as simply a requirement to follow national laws.
Delegating policing and censorship functions to private actors not only minimizes reputational damage, but also ensures more effective control and spending.
Agora also notes a sharp increase in restrictions on individual pieces of content: a total of 662,842 items were censored in 2018, in comparison to 115,706 in 2017.
This includes blocked websites and individual URLs, online news articles, social media posts deemed extremist or inflammatory etc.
In a rare instance of good news, one of the most infamous items of the Russian criminal code, Article 282 (Incitement of hatred or enmity, as well as abasement of human dignity,) responsible for the majority of prosecutions for online speech, was reined in by an amendment passed in December 2018.
This appears to have brought a decline in prosecutions related to online speech.
However, legal experts are skeptical about the possible liberalization of Russian laws.
Agoras report predicts that public prosecutors may shift towards using other, less severe articles in both the criminal and administrative codes to punish dissent.
This could enable them to silence individual users and organizations, while triggering less visible public backlash.
Agora also notes that western IT platforms are increasingly acquiescent towards the demands of the Russian authorities, a trend that Runet Echo covered previously.
Citing Google's Transparency Report, Agora says that in June 2018 Google satisfied 79 percent of all data removal requests from the Russian government, while only 62 percent of similar requests from the US authorities were complied with.
Google's report shows that requests for content removal from the Russian government multiplied by more than five-fold in six months in 2016 from 2,045 in June to 11,164 in December.
To Google's credit, it didn't comply with any of the 94 removal requests from the Russian government which it classifies under Government criticism.
Google also provides some examples of the content they're removing, and a significant part of is genuinely dangerous to the public: ads for illegal casinos scamming people out of their hard-earned rubles, violent racist propaganda, online drug markets selling dangerous substances etc.
But Google readily complied with requests for removal of activist videos calling for rallies against corruption because these rallies were arbitrarily declared unsanctioned and thus in violation of a pointedly restrictive law aimed at stifling public dissent.
Twitter, Google and Facebook have all shown that they're willing to remove content or make it unavailable to Russian users upon receiving requests from the Russian authorities to comply with the local laws.
There is little indication that the companies take into consideration the exceedingly restrictive nature of some of these laws, or that they are weighing these requests against Russia's constitution.
Another report by the Internet Protection Society (OZI) is even darker in its predictions: its titled The New Year Pessimism, and it notes the longest and sharpest drop of its online freedom of speech index since the measurements began in 2016.
OZI lists seven events that impacted the index in January, all in a negative way: from new pieces of legislation to landmark cases, such as the prosecution of Yana Antonova, a pediatric surgeon in Krasnodar, who was targeted for sharing a video by Open Russia, an activist media outlet declared an undesirable organization.
Being associated with an undesirable organization the government-mandated list also includes the National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Foundation is an offence punishable by a law introduced in 2015 by a range of penalties, from a heavy fine to a prison term.
Sharing a Facebook video also counts as collaborating with an undesirable organization, which Antonova learned the hard way.
The OZI report also emphasized the potential damage of the Klishas bill, which came as part of the package of restrictive pieces of legislation currently reviewed by the Russian parliament.
Named after its author, senator Andrey Klishas, the bill aims to create a sovereign infrastructure for the Russian internet, ostensibly to shield it from foreign interference.
The other, an anti-fake news bill also co-authored by Klishas, is even more controversial and almost universally condemned by experts.
Yet both passed in the first reading thanks to the overwhelming majority that the ruling United Russia party holds in the parliament.
It seems that the Russian government is finally confident in its ability to control online activity so confident that it can now offer internet access to all Russians, without fearing the consequences.
The following post is originally written by Holmes Chan and published on Hong Kong Free Press on 21 of Feburary, 2019.
The edited version is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.
Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham has been handed a 16-day jail sentence for refusing to pay a fine for a public talk he hosted with Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong via Skype in 2016.
He is out on bail pending appeal.
Wham is an activist known for his campaigns promoting the rights of migrant workers, free speech in Singapore, and reform of the countrys laws on detention and the death penalty.
Last month, Wham was convicted of illegal assembly over a November 2016 forum he hosted on the topic of civil disobedience and social movements, which featured Joshua Wong and local media activists.
Wham was told by police that he needed a permit for Wong to speak, but he went ahead without one.
On 21 February, the court fined Wham S $2,000 (USD $1476) for organising a public assembly without a police permit.
He also received a fine of S $1,200 (USD $886) for failing to sign a police statement.
Singaporean media reported that Wham chose not to pay the fine, and that the court sentenced him to 16 days in prison for failure to pay the fine.
Aside from illegal assembly, Wham was also charged for refusing to sign his police witness statement.
He said at the time that he chose not to sign because he was not given a copy.
Wham intends to appeal the judges decision.
He has been released on a bail of S $8,000 (USD $5,906), according to media reports.
The forum in question was organised by Community Action Network, a non-governmental group concerned with freedom of expression in the city-state.
According to Wham, the police told him it was compulsory to get a work permit and police permit if any of the participating speakers were not from Singapore even if they spoke remotely via video link.
After the event, Wham was questioned by police for 45 minutes.
He was finally charged in November 2017, but the case did not come before a judge until January 2019.
Joshua Wong told HKFP that Whams prosecution was an embarrassment and a terrible injustice, and that he deeply regretted the judgment.
Jolovan generously invited me to share and exchange my experience in Hong Kongs fight for freedom and justice with the Singaporean community the irony is not missed here that Jolovan has become a subject of injustice as a result.
Id like to express my respect and admiration for Jolovans perseverance of his values, and my wish for the Singaporean people to one day be able to enjoy true freedom and democracy.
Stretching of the law
Singaporean journalist and Global Voices collaborator Kirsten Han, who was also a guest speaker at Whams forum, decried the sentence as outrageous.
[The forum] posed no threat to public order whatsoever, and the stretching of the law to declare a forum illegal simply because a non-Singaporean Skyped in shows how broad Singapores public order laws are, and how they can be used to restrict Singaporeans civil libertiesTheres no sentence that Id consider fair, because he should never have been charged.
Han also disputed the prosecutions account of events.
According to Channel NewsAsia, the prosecution argued in court that thousands were invited to the forum and 366 people indicated they were interested in attending.
However, Han said the event only had slightly more than 60 attendees and was pretty standard.
The venue wasnt that big anyway, she added.
Blogger Malele Paulo also known as King Faipopo.
Source: Facebook
Samoan police arrested Australia-based blogger Malele Paulo on 8 February while he was visiting the country to attend his mothers funeral.
Malele is a known critic of the government who writes under the pen name King Faipopo.
The police confirmed that Malele was arrested for making false statements with the intention of causing harm to a member of our Samoan communities reputation.
In August 2018, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi filed a defamation complaint against Malele, which appears to have set the stage for his arrest after he entered the country in early February.
He was released on bail on 9 February, and was able to attend his mothers funeral.
In 2013, Samoa withdrew libel from its criminal law as a media reform initiative.
But the change didn't last long.
At the end of 2017, the parliament of the Polynesian island nation unanimously voted to revive its criminal libel law after Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said it is needed to fight ghostwriters and troublemakers, despite opposition from media freedom advocates.
The Tuilaepa government said the law will be used against anonymous bloggers and Facebook users who spread lies and misinformation.
The prime minister cited this law in his complaint against Malele, whom he accused of posting false information about him and Samoan politics.
Malele reportedly wrote on his blog that Tuilaepa committed murder, corruption, theft, and gun smuggling.
Tuilaepa insisted that he is not against citizens expressing their views:
I am not prohibiting anyone from exercising their freedom of speech or freedom of expression but I take issue when the rights of the innocent, like myself are violated through lies and deceit.
This kind of lying and attacking members of the community through social media is what the law was designed to prevent.
After Tuilaepa filed the defamation complaint, his government sought the extradition of Malele from Australia.
A police statement concerning Malele's arrest also cautioned the public to avoid making defamatory statements on social media:
The damage that defamatory statements on social media outlets and cyber bullying has done to several members of the community is a matter that these laws are designed to address.
Where complaints are laid with the police, we will do our best to assist those being victimised on social media platforms by false statements.
Pacific Freedom Forum Chair Bernadette Carreon of Palau described Maleles arrest as an attack on freedom of speech:
Focus on fighting corruption, not freedom of speech.
New legislation, based on old criminal libel laws from colonial times, forces Samoa leaders to look backwards, not forwards.
Another critic of the government, blogger Ole Palemia, criticized the decision to arrest Malele:
What the people need to know and always remember is that corrupt PM Tuilaepa and all the politicians are public figures therefore they are subjected to public criticism that's what you call democracy.
Maleles arrest has sparked intense debates in Samoa.
A news report surveyed the views of some citizens who expressed concern about the timing of the arrest while others agreed with the defamation case and urged critics to show respect to the countrys prime minister.
Malele is scheduled to appear before the court on 5 March.
The 2019 Nigerian presidential candidates [Collage by Nwachukwu Egbunike].Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, will hold presidential elections on February 16, 2019.
Although there are 73 presidential candidates, the race for Aso Rock the seat of Nigeria's presidency will be between two major contenders and candidates from the so-called third force, a group of hopefuls who are relatively new to Nigerian politics.
The two major Nigerian parties, All Progressive Congress and Peoples Democratic Party, will, of course, be fielding their candidates:
Muhammad Buhari, president of Nigeria.

Muhammadu Buhari
The incumbent candidate of the All Progressive Congress, Buhari won the 2011 presidential election after defeating former president Goodluck Jonathan.
Buhari's ascendance to power was based on his integrity and perceived ability to curb corruption and the Boko Haram militancy.
However, under his watch, Nigeria has witnessed continued insecurity with pastoral conflicts between herders and farmers as herders from the north move further south in search of arable lands.
Also, human rights have taken a nose drive in his administration, with impunity and corruption at the highest levels of government.
Atiku Abubakar [Image from Campaign Organisation Website].
Atiku Abubakar
Abubakar is the former vice president and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.
He has tried in the past to win presidential elections but has not been successful.
However, his campaign received a major boost with the reconciliation with his boss, former President Olusegun Obasanjo who had described Buhari's administration as a failed government.
As vice president, Abubakar oversaw the privatization and sale of hundreds of loss-making and poorly managed public enterprises.
A few other presidential hopefuls to watch are:
Oby Ezekwesili [Image released by campaign organizers as media resource]
Obiageli [Oby] Ezekwesili
Ezekwesili, the only major female candidate in this year's race, served as the minister of solid minerals and later education during the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 to 2007.
She was also former vice president of the Africa division of the World Bank from May 2007 to May 2012.
Ezekwesili has been at the forefront of the call to rescue about 200 school girls who were abducted by the Boko Haram militant Islamic group in 2014.
She is a co-founder of the #BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) Movement.
She is also the presidential flag-bearer of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria.

Kingsley Moghalu
Moghalu is a professor of international business and public policy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, USA.
Moghalu had previously worked in the United Nations from 1992 to 2008.
He was deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2014, where he led extensive reforms in the Nigerian banking system after the global financial crisis.
He is the candidate of the Young Progressive Party.
Omoyele Sowore [Screen shot from CNBCAfrica interview, Dec 13, 2018].
Omoyole Sowore
Sowore is the founder and publisher of SaharaReporters (SR), an investigative online newspaper.
SR has been described as Africa's Wikileaks.
This human rights activist is running under the banner of African Action Congress.
The race is on for Nigeria's future
Buhari and Abubakar are the major contenders in this race.
Both men have been constants in the political arena in Nigeria.
On the other hand, Ezekwesili, Moghalu, Sowore, the third force, are a group making their first entry into the partisan political space.
Buhari will be running on the gains of his administration over the past three years and must contend with the fact that Nigeria was recently ranked as the poverty capital of the world.
The Punch newspaper described Buharis parochial appointments as unprecedented and has left the country deeply divided.
His fight against corruption appears selective and punitive.
The recent move to try the Chief Justice of the Federation so close to the presidential election was described by the Nigerian Bar Association as a pattern of consistent assault on the heads of the two independent arms of government by the Buhari administration.
Abubakar, on the other hand, is riding on the gains of multiple lucrative business interests.
However, he has an uphill task considering the power of incumbency of his major opponent.
Whoever wins the 2019 elections will face enormous challenges like the strengthening the economy, internal security, restructuring power and power devolution, and ethnoreligious politics.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this post stated that there are 35 presidential candidates and has been updated to reflect that there are 73 presidential candidates.
Eissa Muhamad, from Niger, has been stranded at the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for two months now.
Photo by Eissa Muhamad, used with permission.
Eissa Muhamad, from Niger, says he has been stranded in the transit section of Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for more than two months, starting on November 6, 2018.
Muhamad, 24, was deported from Israel where he lived for eight years as a migrant.
I met Muhamad on December 12, 2018, at Bole International Airport while in transit in Addis Ababa.
Muhamad tells me he has been deported twice from Israel in 2018.
When he returned to Niger the first time, Muhamad's Israeli travel documents were still valid, so he turned around and booked another flight back to Israel.
When he arrived in Israel, authorities confiscated his travel documents and deported him again back to Niger.
When Muhamad returned to Niger the second time, authorities requested proof of citizenship but he failed to produce valid documents, either Israeli or Nigerien, to support his citizenship.
Muhamad remained in Nigerien custody for eight days before being deported back to Israel via Ethiopia on an Ethiopian Airlines flight.
When he arrived at Bole International Airport in Ethiopia, Ethiopian authorities, in collaboration with the Israeli government, prevented him from boarding his connecting flight to Israel.
They informed him that Israel was not willing to accept him, and since then, he has been stranded inside the airport, stuck between Niger and Israel.
I slept on the chairs, sometimes I slept in the mosque, I didnt take [a] shower for two months because [the] airport [has] no place for a shower, I only wash my face, my hands and my legs, thats all.
Muhamad has attempted to contact the Niger embassy in Addis Ababa, but because he was not able to provide valid documents to prove his Niger citizenship, Muhamad says they were unable to assist him.
As of 2018, Israel currently has 34,000 African migrants who undertook perilous journeys to Israel in search of a better life.
But Israel claims many are economic migrants who have put a strain on the economy.
Opting to stay meant jail time and significantly fewer resettlement options.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the right-wing Likud party remain focused on targeting those deemed infiltrators.
Israel Democracy Institute study says 66 percent of Israelis support government policies to deport African immigrants.
Muhamad claims that he was legally living in Israel and worked in a factory, and told me the government took away his residency status and threw him out of the country.
Ethiopian authorities have not arrested Muhamad and have provided meals for him while staying at the airport.
Technically, Ethiopia is a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol as well as the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, and nearly all refugees entering Ethiopia are granted asylum on a prima facie basis, but Muhamad told me he is not willing to apply for asylum in Ethiopia.
In this video interview, Muhamad explains to me what it has been like to stay trapped at the airport in Addis Ababa without a clear idea of the future:
Screen capture from a video of the Russian Ambassador giving his speech by Africa Guinee TV on YouTube [in French]On January 9, 2019, Alexander Bregadze, the Russian Federation's ambassador to the Republic of Guinea, sent his New Year's compliments to Alpha Condé, president of the West African country.
He filmed the video greeting in Conakry, the capital, where his diplomatic office is located and in his speech, broached a particularly sensitive subject the possibility of Guineans changing the constitution to allow President Condé to seek a third term after his current tenure expires in 2020:
Since Guinea has become the Guinea of Alpha Condé, it is truly on the march.
Mr. President, you are a beacon to the youth of your country.
Unfortunately, the principle of political succession, which dominates many constitutions in the world, not all happily, entrenches an attitude of payback: It's our turn now, we must run the country
But constitutions are neither dogma, Bible, nor Quran.
Constitutions adapt themselves to reality, he continued in Condé's presence, making it clear that reality did not adapt itself to constitutions: Even for Christians, there's the New Testament and the Old.
According to the ambassador, all is well in Guinea.
And yet, the facts reflect another reality.
Teachers went on a general strike this year that lasted three months, unemployment is growing nationwide, and Guinea was found to be the chief country of origin for illegal migrants entering Europe in 2018, with a staggering statistic of 13,068 people.
Yet, the ambassador went on:
Before our eyes, Guinea is becoming the most electrified country in Africa.
Year after year, the roads between Conakry and the regions are getting easier to drive.
In an article for the newspaper Vision Guinée, journalist Pathé Bah writes that Ousmane Kaba, a former strategic adviser of President Condé, acknowledged in a public intervention:
Guinea is in darkness.
There is no electricity in our country.
That is why I have fought for the money to build Kaleta [a hydroelectric power station] on the Konkouré [river].
We are fighting to get many reservoirs on the Konkouré, because it takes the country forward.
As for the country's economy, the finance minister estimates the level of growth at 5.8 percent for 2018, with an inflation rate of 8 percent.
The African Development Bank reckons that Guinea marked growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of 6.6 percent in 2016 and 6.4 percent in 2017 but that didn't stop the ambassador from declaring exaggerated numbers to indicate growth:
Over the last few years, we have seen an increase of between 10.5 percent in 2016, and from 6 to 7 per cent in 2018, with a forecast of 7 percent in 2019 Do you know many countries in Africa which are doing better?
The ambassador added road conditions to his litany of praise for the president.
However, Alimou Sow, an eminent Guinean blogger, shared a contradictory experience on his blog:
I've been up since daybreak to confront, alone, what is judged to be the most difficult stretch, Conakry-Kindia 135 kilometers, which one could complete, a few years ago, in a little under two hours by the stopwatch.
Now, you must add two more hours to crawl the same distance, turned into a dream route for an endurance rally à la Paris-Dakar, so perilous is the state of the road.
In 2016, members of the Guinea Bloggers Association launched a campaign to draw attention to the state of the country's roads, and show their exasperation via the hashtag #montronsnosroutes [let's show our roads].
The Guinea Bloggers Association will start a campaign to denounce the state of the road in Guinea.
The idea is to share a photo on social media with the #ShowOurRoads hashtag.

The Russian ambassador's speech has caused embarrassment to both civil society and the diplomatic community.
Guinea's opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, castigated the diplomat's attitude in these terms, quoted by Balla Yombouno in the newspaper Le Djely:
He has been manipulated by Alpha Condé himself.
And we know that he is the representative of a great nation, a great country which actively participated in the decolonisation of the African continent, and which has had an exemplary relationship with Guinea in respect of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs [] We will be striving to contact the Russian government to press this position
Speaking on behalf of civil society activists, Gabriel Haba, president of the Citizen Action Brigade, expressed indignation sparked by the ambassador's support; journalist Ibrahima Sory Barry posted about it for Aminata.com:
The question of political succession is a question of sovereignty.
And sovereignty belongs to the people.
It is not part of an ambassador's role to dictate Guinea's fate.
It is an interference in our country's internal affairs.
The civil society organisation Cellule Balai Citoyen (Citizen's Sweep Up) published a press release, which read in part:
Guinea is at risk of an unprecedented embarassment which is liable to unleash a sociopolitical impetus for a third term in violation of the current constitution and indeed, the ethics of democratic governance.
This increasingly palpable attempt could give rise to political violence with serious human rights violations in our country, which is still struggling to make good the heavy legacy of this kind from independence to our own time.
On Facebook, writer and commentator Ibrahim Marie Sanoh wrote:
It's pretty peculiar that it takes a foreigner to pay tribute to the Guinean regime's feats, and plead for it to be given more years to make the country the most electrified in the world's most industrial continent, while the people who have brought it to power manifest a cruel indifference and have nothing to say.
Meanwhile, the behaviour of other ambassadors attracted the attention of Guinean blogger Nouhou Baldé:
This declaration is so serious that the silence of the rest can't so easily excuse it.
All the more so as some of those who have spoken up since (the Moroccan ambassador, the representative of the World Bank) have said the same as that is to say, no better than their Russian counterpart.
No one has disassociated themselves from this declaration and no embassy has published a communiqué
On January 14, security forces dispersed a demonstration outside the Russian embassy, which civil society organisations had organised in protest over the ambassador's comments.
Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria.
]As Nigeria prepares for another presidential election in February, retired military generals turned politicians are key to understanding Nigeria's political space.
Nigeria has been ruled by either former generals or those who have their support since 1999 when democratic governance returned.
The recent public feud between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari both retired military dictators has a great impact on next month's elections.
In a rare open letter to Buhari, Obasanjo has accused him of plans to rig the 2019 elections.
He wrote:
Democracy becomes a sham if elections are carried out by people who should be impartial and neutral umpires, but who show no integrity, acting with blatant partiality, duplicity and imbecility.
Obasanjo insisted that Buhari would not deliver free, fair, credible and peaceful elections and warned that what is happening under Buharis watch can be likened to what we witnessed under Gen. Sani Abacha.
In 1998, Sani Abacha, a military dictator, had called for general elections but it became obvious that Abacha had no intention of handing power over to civilians.
The five political parties at the time endorsed Abacha as their sole presidential candidate.
Now deceased, Abacha became infamous for his repression of human rights and corruption.
Obasanjo alleged that Buhari was towing the same path as Abacha in mad desperation.
Shehu Garba, the media assistant to President Buhari, dismissed Obasanjo's letter:
The elections starting in February will be free and fair as promised the nation and the international community by President Buhari.
Obasanjo, the letter writer?
Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state (1976-1979) and later Nigerias democratically elected president (1999-2007), has consistently criticized successive governments in Nigeria.
Last year, Obasanjo had advised Buhari not to seek re-election as president but to consider a deserved rest at this point in time and at this age.
This advice caused ripples in Nigeria because Obasanjo was a strong supporter of the Buharis candidacy during the 2015 presidential elections.
Prior, Obasanjo had scolded Goodluck Jonathan in a public letter written in 2013, Obasanjo accused Jonathan of driving the country to the precipice and allowing deceit, corruption and mutual distrust to tear at the fabric of the nation.
Ironically, Obasanjo had also supported Jonathan's election in 2011.
And in 2007, he promoted the election of Jonathan Goodluck's predecessor, Umaru Musa YarAdua.
However, Obasanjo went against YarAdua when the latter became sick and did not hand properly hand over power to Jonathan, his then deputy.

Retired generals never rest in Nigeria
Nigerias political landscape is held by retired generals or their cronies.
Obasanjo, for instance, has been instrumental in the emergence of Nigerian presidents from 2007 to 2015.
However, unlike civilians YarAdua and Jonathan who he promoted and also criticized, Buhari is somewhat different.
Although Obasanjo supported Buharis election in 2015, he cannot fully take the praise alone.
This is because Buharis ascendance to power was made possible by his allegiance with Bola Tinubus defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).
Buharis Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) later merged with ACN, in February 2013, to form the All Progressive Congress (APC) .
In addition, Buhari a former military head of state (1983-1985) is a member of the club of retired generals who have dominated Nigerias political space.
Therefore, as harsh as Obasanjos reprimand might sound, a lot depends on the dynamics of the power block to which they both belong.
Obasanjo is not alone, however, in his criticism of Buhari.
Theophilus Danjuma, a retired general, had in March last year accused the Nigerian armed forces of aiding the ongoing killings in Nigeria.
Danjuma, a former chief of army staff and later minister of defense, chastised the military for taking sides in the pastoral/farmer crisis in the country, but especially in his home state of Taraba.
Similarly, Danjuma recently raised an alarm about plans to use the police and soldiers to manipulate the 2019 elections.
Similarly, in February last year, former military head of state Ibrahim Babangida publicly advised President Buhari not to stand for re-election, arguing that 21st century Nigeria needs to tap younger generations.
He believes that there comes a time in the life of a nation when personal ambition should not override national interest.
But it may be a while before Nigeria gets a civilian president who has no links or backing from the retired generals club.

Ten years ago, on Saturday 7 February 2009, Victoria experienced catastrophic bushfires which killed 173 people, injuring more than four hundred and destroying over two thousand homes.
Seven people died later as the result of their injuries.
During the week of the 2019 anniversary, Victorians have remembered Black Saturday, with mainstream media presenting many personal stories of the fires.
ABC Melbourne, the local arm of the national broadcaster, commemorated the victims by sharing stories from survivors.
Others have shared their memories online.
On her blog, The small Adventurer, Indya recounts losing her home and shares the impact of the fires on her life since that day:
Ten entire years, and I still dont think one single day has passed without me mentioning or at least thinking about the fires.
[] I am also still really, really nervous around things like ovens, stoves, heaters, and even lighters.
As a baker, you can imagine how difficult having those fears is when Im going to take something out of the oven, and suddenly something doesnt move the way I expect it to or something like that, and I instantly freeze up and freak out.
[] Tomorrow I will be thinking of all those who had it much worse than me, and hoping that the people who are still alive and lost so much more are doing okay.
But, I will also be thinking about myself, and allowing myself to feel whatever I happen to feel, because my feelings are valid too.
My fear and sadness is valid too, and always have been, it just took me a while to realise it.
Dianne McNamara posted only the second tweet on this account:
10 years on.
My heart and soul changed forever.
As always, my thoughts are with every person affected by Black Saturday.
I am forever grateful for the help my family and I received from those on and off the mountain.
I was luckier than some.
Melbourne lawyer Georgia was fifteen at the time.
She summed up the feelings of many:
10 years since my dad jumped in the car with my neighbour and headed towards the devastating fires to rescue my neighbours parents.
10 years since those same fires took so many lives, so many homes, so many animals and so many livelihoods.
We will never forget #BlackSaturday
Robin Steenberg shared a devastating memory:
10 years ago, my best man, and his family, perished in the Black Saturday Fires, north of Melbourne, Australia.
Still feels like yesterday.
Our thoughts go out for there Families.
RIP My dear friends.
Many people are connecting the Black Saturday tragedy to current extreme weather conditions that are wreaking havoc in other parts of the country.
Another natural disaster with extraordinary flooding has hit Northern Queensland following record rainfall.
Blair Drysdale gave some sense of the impact in inland areas:
This is a mates farm north of Julia Creek in North Queensland, his whole farm is like this.all 150,000 acres.
The situation in the coastal city of Townsville was also extreme.
Video news agency Ruptly documented the torrents:
#Townsville hit by record flooding as dam gates opened#Australia pic.twitter.com/zYjFtnIjke
Melburnian Ann Moorfield made the connection:
Just need to remind everyone that when we had Black Saturday there were floods in qld same time.
There was an appeal in Qld for flood victims and the victims said to send the money to Vic bush fire victims they need it more..so dig deep for Qld flood victims.
#Townsville
Elizabeth Donoghue took the photo at the top of this story from a road that many people describe as a death trap, a road that I have always avoided till now.
But it was worth a hairy drive!
She posted it two months after the fires on Flickr:
Now that everyone knows that this beautiful country that was so burnt in February is not really destroyed, but is just doing what nature intended, and is regenerating, as nature intended, let me show you this amazing landscape.
It gives some idea of the scale of the fires; and it also shows, for me, the folds and rhythms of the land beneath the vegetation.
i took this from a road that many people describe as a death trap, a road that I have always avoided till now.
But it was worth a hairy drive!
Finally, Adrian Cutts reflected on the growth of social media since Black Saturday:
Incidentally, it will also be 10 years tomorrow, since most of Australia found out what Twitter was.
Black Saturday was the turning point for Twitter in this country, from when it was perceived to be a untested medium, to becoming a part of our lives.

Mozambican journalist Amade Abubacar was arrested on January 5, while reporting on a trend of violent attacks on small villages in Mozambique's province of Cabo Delgado.
Located in northern Mozambique, Cabo Delgado is rich with natural resources, such as ruby, charcoal and natural gas, found in the Rovuma Basin.
Some observers say the group coordinating the attacks intends to begin trafficking these resources.
Since October 2017, multiple attacks have been carried out in different districts of Cabo Delgado by what appears to be the same rogue group.
Many media have reported on the attacks, but state officials have been unwilling to comment on or confirm evidence in these cases.
In 2018, more than one hundred people were prosecuted together in relation to these crimes.
Their trial is expected to end this year.
#FreeAmade: campaign to release Mozambican journalist
Amade Aoubacar works with the Mozambican Social Communication Institute and as a journalist with news site Zitamar and the local radio station, Nacedje.
The journalist was arrested and detained by Mozambican federal police on January 5, while photographing survivors of an attack in Cabo Delgado.
Amade was then taken to a military quarter of the Defense Forces of Mozambique in the district of Mueda, despite not being a member of the armed forces.
After a few weeks, he was transferred to a civilian prison to legalize his detention in Pemba, capital of Cabo Delgado .
After he arrived at the civilian prison, Amade contacted the Mozambican Order of Lawyers and reported having experienced torture at the hands of Mozambican armed forces, who he says beat him and deprived him of food.
Many individuals and media freedom groups have spoken out in his Abubacar's defense, saying that his arrest and detention have threatened the exercise of free expression.
The Media Institute of Southern Africa, which monitors media rights and activities in the region, spoke out strongly against Amade's detention:
Abubacars prolonged detention by the military is a violation of his rights as well as his arrest under unconfirmed charges.
The Mozambican government is setting a bad precedent in the violation of free expression and access to information in the region.
Amnesty International also released a statement:
Amade Abubacar is a respected journalist who was recording testimony from people who fled deadly attacks in Cabo Delgado when he was arrested by police.
This is the latest demonstration of contempt coming from Mozambican authorities and directed at freedom of expression and freedom of the press [authorities] view journalists as a threat and [thus they] are treated as criminals.
The campaign has also spread on Twitter, with the creation of hashtags like #FreeAmade to advocate for the liberation of Amade.
@UNHumanRights demands immediate release of journalist #AmadeAbubacar
Arbitrary detention was no longer enough, they had to torture him, make him sleep with handcuffs at the military base without give him food.
This is terrible.
#FreeAmade #CaboDelgado
Angela Quintal, coordinator of the Africa program for the Committee to Protect Journalists, cast blame on the president of Mozambique:
#Mozambique: Today, Jan 30, is the 25th day journalist #AmadeAbubacar remains detained simply because of his journalism.
One would think that President @FNyusi has enough on his plate without having to waste resources on jailing an innocent man #FreeAmade https://t.co/giF8zFnaCY
Nyerere Square in Dodoma, the capital of Tanzania, and home of the parliament, Bunge.

On January 29, when the Tanzanian parliament (Bunge) assembled in Dodoma for its first session of 2019, an owl flew into the building, perched on the ceiling and observed the assembly from above.
The incident drew national attention and provoked questions from social media users and newspapers.
What could the presence of an owl in parliament mean?
The owl has been spotted twice inside the halls of parliament in the city of Dodoma.
Bad omen?
the regional weekly, The East African, proposed.
The British blogger and media analyst, Ben Taylor, went further:
The owl that entered parliament signalled the coming death of Tanzanian democracy?
Cartoon by Samuel Mwamkinga (Joune), used with permission.
Tanzanian cartoonist, Samuel Mwamkinga (Joune), later illustrated the incident with a reference to the British term a group of owls based on the Greek perception that owls are wise (illustration used with permission).
The owl is, however, seen as an omen of death and misfortune in Tanzania.
And the owl was determined to stay in Bunge, according to The Citizen:
The owl, a nocturnal bird, could not leave despite several attempts by parliament officials to evict it.
Owls are not unusual in Tanzania, and neither is Tanzanians inclination toward superstition.
A 2010 survey found that 93 percent of Tanzanians believe in witchcraft.
No ordinary parliament session
For this particular session, the presence of the owl offered a symbolism, even for the nonsuperstitious, which was too stark to be ignored.
On the agenda for Tanzanias first parliamentary session of 2019 were the proposed amendments of the Political Parties Act, which has followed a months-long, intense debate in an increasingly unstable political climate.
Tanzania made history in 1992 as one of the first countries in Africa to establish a multiparty system, which allowed opposition parties.
The Political Parties Act (here with proposed amendments) was also introduced in 1992 and has been amended over time with the latest amendment in 2009.
With the owl perching above the assembly, Tanzanian parliamentarians agreed to amend the act a step that critics regard as a serious weakening of the multiparty system in Tanzania, and thus also democracy.
In short, the renewal of the act provides more authority to the government-appointed registrar to not only deregister political parties but also to issue punishments in the form of imprisonment if a political party, for instance, carries out civic education related to voter registration and other politically-motivated activities, according to Reuters.
Several media quoted Zitto Kabwe, leader of the opposition party ACT-Wazalendo, who already back in August 2017 criticized the proposed amendment of the act, predicting it may undermine political rights.
Kabwe then compared it to the Media Services Bill 2016, which set the free and independent media back.
Now, Kabwe calls attention to the inherent contradiction caused by the amendment of the Political Parties Act:
You cant have a constitution that allows freedom of association then give someone powers to revoke that freedom of association.

Tanzania's declining democracy under the rule of President Magufuli has been a recurring topic in the media, including a popular topic for satire.
On January 30, Fatma Karume, Chair Woman of Tanganyika Law Society, tweeted a cartoon by the Kenyan cartoonist Gado (September 22, 2017) pointing to the role of Tanzanias President Magufuli and the death of democracy:
Good morning everyone.
Have a lovely day.
In recent years, Tanzania has turned increasingly authoritarian in its legislation, resulting in less space for critical political opponents and independent media.
Now, critics say the amended Political Parties Act will make it more difficult to practice politics that are critical of the president and Chama Cha Mapinduzi (The Party of the Revolution), in power since independence in 1961.
Opposition is essential for a vibrant democracy.
A strong opposition will check up on government and challenge it.
If there is no opposition, diversity of citizen needs are unlikely to be represented well.
In 15 tweets, doctoral student Rachel McLellan walked readers through possible consequences of the new act, and characterizes a situation where a critical opposition will find itself cornered:
So most of your ways of convincing voters are gone.
What do you do if you're an opp party?
Go back to the drawing board and come up with new strategies, right?
Well, this bill introduces unprecedented oversight powers to the Parties Registrar that make that v difficult 5/n
Superstitious or not those critical of Tanzania's authoritarian turn found some wicked relief in the presence of the owl and the unsuccessful attempts to chase it away.
The owl remained.
Speaker of the Parliament, Job Ndugai, tried to tweak traditional belief with a pragmatic explanation:
Honourable Members of Parliament, we have been seeing an owl in this House since morning but in the tradition of people of Dodoma, an owl that is seen during daytime cannot have any effect on anyone.
This means that we have nothing to worry about its presence.
For the critical, however, there is nothing pragmatic about the new act.

Spread love, not hate is the mantra that rang out during Guyana's first gay pride parade, which took place on June 3, 2018.
It was an event that allowed the country's LGBT community the opportunity to step out of the cloak of invisibility and claim their right to be proud of who they are and who they choose to love:
Spread love, not hate
Congratulations on your first-ever Pride parade, Guyana!
The festivities kicked off at the Square of the Revolution in the capital city of Georgetown, with participants wearing rainbow coloured garb and dancing to soca music as they marched in solidarity against hate and bigotry:
A Proud Moment to celebrate the exsistence of LGBTQ+ Citizens in Guyana pic.twitter.com/S5PdblZn7b
Guyana Trans United (@trans_guyana) June 3, 2018
Anal sex (commonly known as buggery in many Caribbean territories) is still illegal in Guyana, despite the landmark rulings in the Caleb Orozco case in Belize in 2016, and the more recent Jason Jones case in Trinidad and Tobago, both of which deemed the criminalisation of sodomy unconstitutional.
Both cases were not without controversy and negative reactions, region-wide and neither was Guyanas gay pride parade.
Netizens were quite vocal about their opposing views.
In once Facebook thread, Yolanda Adams left a scathing comment that reflected just how much of a role religion plays in the issue:
Mr President stand your ground, if you only promote this act, the country will be curse[d] because God is totally against it.
He has destroy[ed] a nation already because of this act and hasn't changed.
These are not the days to please mankind, your first duty is to protect the inncocent (sic) children.
Because if you don't you will answer to God.
So don't make decisions on Votes, God put you there not man.
So please put God first.
Shanna Leaona Patterson was also against the revocation of the law:
This government stands a better chance if they legalize small quantities of marijuana instead of antimen so they had better choose wisely
The Guyanese term for a male homosexual is an anti-man.
Facebook user Brenda Oliver had this to say:
People just trying a thing that will not pass in Guyana.
Guyana is not America
Other Facebook users thought the event was a blatant contradiction of the country's laws, and there was a lot of discussion about religious damnation.
One commenter suggested that the country had other issues to resolve race relations, for example that were more pressing.
Those in support of the parade or at least those reserving judgement appeared to be in the minority.
For Guyana's LGBT community, however, the event was a first step against the marginalisation they face because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.
Member of Parliament Priya Manickchand, who supports the communitys efforts, said that people should be able to make their own choices, and that the government had no place in people's bedrooms.
Her statements attracted online support.
Facebook user Shannon Andre Persaud wrote:
I really cant tolerate people against the LBGTQ community.
What a tremendous step it was to see this embraced in Guyana but not of course without the ignorant trolls.
But instead of engaging with discriminative and uneducated people, I unfriended and problem solved!
Love is love And this world could do with less hatred and discrimination and lots more love and humanity.
#isupportthelbgtqcommunity
There was also some advocacy on Twitter:
One to go!
#Guyana is the only South American country where homosexuality is still illegal.
It just held its first LGBT Pride parade.
Let's hope decriminalisation is next: https://t.co/KinMuV8YK6 Congratulations to @SASODGuyana @GuyanaTrans & Guyana Rainbow Foundation.
SOLIDARITY
The parade is just one facet of the communitys fight for equal rights.
Joel Simpson, managing director of the Society Against Sexual Orientation and Discrimination (SASOD) who organised the parade, had a message for government officials the LGBT community expects to see action.
However, there is strong resistance.
At a conference the day before the gay pride parade, members of the Georgetown Ministers Fellowship expressed their displeasure by threatening to withhold their votes during elections.
The Christian community comprises more than 60% of Guyana's population and, as is the case in other regional territories, is lobbying against overturning age-old buggery laws.
The Fellowship even threatened to block the parade, but with a strong police presence, there were no incidents.
Simpson, who attended the conference as a representative of the gay community, indicated that LGBT citizens were still waiting on a 2015 campaign promise of legislative change:
We are voting, tax paying law abiding citizens like everyone We are not asking for anything special.We should enjoy protection from discrimination.

Daniel Elombah is the publisher of elombah.com.
According to Premium Times, the Elombahs were arrested at their home in Nnewi, in south eastern Nigeria:
Daniel Elombah was arrested around 4:30 a.m. at his home in Nnewi on New Years Day, according to his brother, Paul.
He said they gathered from the officers that his brother was detained over a recent article that was deemed critical of the Inspector-General of Police Ibrahim Idris.
Mr. Elombah was initially taken to a SARS detention facility in Anambra but was later moved to Abuja around 7:00 a.m., his brother said.
Daniel Elombah told the Committee to Protect Journalists that police cited an article published in Opinion Nigeria as the reason for the arrest.
The article, which was published on December 22, 2017 in Opinion Nigeria and was not written by either of the brothers, purported that Nigeria's Inspector General of Police was involved in an unending baggage of controversy.
In an interview with the Daily Post, Inspector General Ibrahim Idris deflected direct questions about the reasons for the Elombahs arrests, simply saying that whenever you commit an offence it is our duty to ensure that we respond.
Daniel Elombah, who resides in the UK but was visiting his family in Nigeria at the time of the arrests, is know for his critical reporting on Boko Haram and President Buhari.

[Image released on Facebook by Elombah's solicitor, Obunike Ohaegbu]Nigerian journalist Daniel Elombah and his brother, Timothy Elombah, were arrested by the Nigerian police on New Year's Day.
The journalist was released later that day and soon after was hospitalized in Abuja.
Though no official explanation was given by Elombah about his hospitalization, it seems the journalist had to receive medical attention after being handcuffed like a criminal and transported in a bus over a very bad road for 700 miles to Abuja.
During the trip, the Elombah brothers were assaulted, slapped, punched and beaten by the Nigerian Police, according to a news report from Vanguard newspaper.
Police have yet to release his brother Timothy.
On January 2, 2018, a Magistrate Court sitting in Abuja granted a warrant to extend Timothy's detention.
This would enable us carry out our preliminary investigations before filing criminal charges against him, said a police spokesperson.
Nigerian authorities should immediately release Timothy Elombah, drop legal proceedings, and allow his brother Daniel to return home, said CPJ Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney, in New York.
Police have no business raiding a journalist's home and locking him up just because an officer does not like something written in the press.
It's not even clear that the man they have detained had anything to do with the article they deem defamatory.
Daniel Elombah has sued Nigeria's Inspector General of Police for violating his fundamental rights in a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
He is requesting 2 billion Naira (about USD $5.5 million) in damages for his unlawful detention.
Similarly, three solicitors based in the United Kingdom have petitioned the British MP, Lyn Brown, the Prime Minister, Theresa May and Foreign Affairs Minister Boris Johnson over the unlawful arrest of Daniel Elombah.

A rumor about the spread of French yellow vest protests to other European countries went viral on Chinese social media before Christmas.
The story emerged after French president Emmanuel Macron announced a number of concessions to address protesters grievances over economic policies.
While Macron expected calm and order be restored, the Chinese-fabricated rumor predicted the opposite.
Multiple versions of the story were spread via a number of micro-blogging accounts on Weibo and Wechat, quoting sources from a commodity wholesaler in Yiwua city well known as a wholesaling centerwho stated that their entire stock of yellow vests in stock was sold out and more orders had been coming in from European nations such as Sweden, Prague, Switzerland, etc.
The story implied that the yellow vest protests were spreading throughout the continent.
Here is one version of the story that circulated on Weibo and WeChat:
[Yiwu Index] Yiwus research report on clothing showed that orders of yellow vests from Europe has continued to surge.
Manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and many traders from overseas e-commerce platforms see the movement as an excellent sales opportunity.
Chinese netizens believed that based on the Yiwu commodity index and its big data, the yellow vest movement would spread to Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Spain.
Foreign media outlets pointed out that the Yiwu Index could accurately predict international political trends.
Commodity orders from overseas market could serve as indicators of public opinion and hence could accurately predict the results of political events.
Back in 2016, based on the orders of election related t-shirts and flags, manufacturers from Yiwu had predicted Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidency five months in advance.
Observers say that textile factories in Yiwu have started receiving orders from the U.S and have begun manufacturing flags and T-shirts for Trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election.
The demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the Democratic Party.
Some have started to predict that Trump would be re-elected.
This shows the power of Chinas big data.
Many retweeted the news with comments such as Yiwu has become a base for predicting global trends, and take a look at Yiwus export data and you can become an analyst of global affairs.
The myth of the Yiwu index
Located in Zhejiang Province, Yiwu is the world's biggest small commodities trading hub, and one of the most popular small commodities wholesale markets in China.
Yiwu's international trade city has an Index called the Yiwu China commodity index that reflects market trends.
During the US election in 2016, the Yiwu Index became a hot topic on Chinese social media, as discussions about election-related merchandise order records in Yiwu seemed to indicate that Donald Trump was more popular than Hillary Clinton.
After the election, even state-affiliated media reported that commodity order records from Yiwu and Alibaba had predictive power, and many Chinese netizens believed that the Yiwu Index was more accurate than the U.S election polls.
Some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic, as Clinton, in fact, received more votes than Trump, but this analysis was ignored.
This time, state-affiliated media outlet Global Times fact-checked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last year's.
The Global Times report, however, has done nothing to stop the spread of the Yiwu Index myth.
In fact, new commentary emerged after the Christmas reasserting the predictive power of Yiwu Index.
The story, republished on various online media platforms, did acknowledge the erroneous sales figures for yellow vests, but continued to insist that the Yiwu Index had successfully predicted the results of both the 2016 U.S presidential election and the 2018 World Cup.
The writer echoed Chinese president Xi Jinping's December 18 speech on the 40th anniversary of the country's reform and opening-up, which cited Yiwu as a successful example of that shift.
The commentary concluded that the predictive power of the Yiwu Index reflects the glorious history of the country's transformation:
40
The reason Yiwu can accurately predict the trend of global affairs again and again is due to the Yiwu peoples contributions in the past few decades.
They have walked a distinctive path in the worlds commodity markets and established the citys leading status as the manufacturing hub of worlds daily necessities.
Open door and reform policy has helped numerous cities like Yiwu to take courageous steps and strike out for success.
Their efforts have brought about the great transformation of China in just 40 years.
This intertwining of the predictive power of the Yiwu Index with China's economic transformation has made the myth even more difficult to debunk.

With the acute lack of resources caused by the war in Yemen, a growing number of families are forced but to take their children out of school.
Girls are often sent away to marry at ages as young as 13.
However, one school in the capital Sana'a found a modest, yet effective, form of relief.
The NGO Solidarios sin Fronteras (based in Spain and Yemen) run almost entirely by volunteers and funded primarily by individual donations some as small as one euro per month, has started to provide a complete breakfast for this school's girl students, who are aged six to 16.
Before the project began, one-fifth of them had been absent.
Little by little, they started to come back and, since September 2018, all 525 students are regularly attending classes, Solidarios founders say.
I've spoken via Whatsapp with two of the NGO's founders, Eva, who I had previously met in person some years ago in Barcelona, and Faten, who is in Yemen.
They told me about how their project Breakfasts to educate and protect came about.
They also asked me to not disclose their full names or the name of the school for security concerns.
In March, 2018, one of the school's teachers reached out to Faten about an 8-year-old girl who seemed to grow thinner and more exhausted by the day.
Suddenly, she stopped attending school.
She had not been the first to quit, but she was the youngest.
The teacher talked to the family: they were in extreme financial need and had received offers to marry their daughter.
When speaking with Faten, the teacher wondered whether a daily food ration could motivate families to keep their daughters in school.
And the idea was born.
Faten says:
Most of [these girls are] daughters of workers of the textile factory, which was completely destroyed [in the bombings].
The families haven't [had any] salary for 3 years.
How could they cover food expenses?
[] The most important thing is that we're supporting them to complete their education.
Their families [are also] happy, as keeping them at school prevents them from staying at home or getting married at such a young age.
In March 2018, the United Nations declared the humanitarian crisis in Yemen the worst in the world.
With raging unemployment and inflation, 80 percent of the country's families are in debt and 65 percent struggle to buy food.

Solidarios sin Fronteras consulted with a pediatrician to design the breakfast's menu.
Faten shops for groceries every morning and a married couple uses her kitchen to prepare, pack and transport the food.
During a 45-minute break at work, she rushes to the school to help the teachers distribute the meals.
Sometimes, her siblings come to help out, too.
This do-it-yourself spirit is true for the organization's three other programs.
With Food aid for families, they distribute food packages for vulnerable families in the cities of Sanaa, Aden, Amran, Raydah, Hodeidah, Al Dorihimi, and displaced families from Taiz.Water for Yemen maintains water reservoirs in the Amran and Raydah camps for internally displaced persons and Rebuilding Socotra provides cement for rebuilding houses and dig wells in the island of Socotra, devastated by hurricanes in 2015.
What if we do it ourselves?
Prepared breakfasts are distributed every morning at the school.

It was on a trip to Yemen Eva took in 2012 that she met Faten.
Eva was watching a birthday party at the next table at a cafe in Sana'a and the birthday girl offered her cake.
The girl was Faten.
They became friends and have seen each other several times since, most recently in 2015, on Eva's latest trip to Sana'a.
Faten remembers:
A few weeks after the war began, I was on WhatsApp (as usual) and I asked Eva, can we do something to help?.
She answered that she would look for an organization in Spain with her friend Noèlia, and I was to look for one here in Yemen.
Eva, who has 15 years of experience in international development, could not find any grassroots NGO working in Yemen that she could trust.
So she and Faten, along with a third friend Noèlia, decided to create their own that same year.
The three women are a volunteer executive team and count with support from trusted volunteers in both countries.
Eva and Noèlia, who are based in Spain, take care of fundraising: they rely on social media, radio, the print press and lectures to spread the word about their work and attract contributors.
Most people donate online and SSF crowdfunds each project separately.
Faten is responsible for administering the ground operations often from her own house.
The three of them make up the executive team and juggle their tasks in the NGO with their daily jobs.
They regularly share photographs, videos, and detailed updates on the SSF's social media pages.
They also circulate content to raise awareness about the war in Yemen, in particular, the role of Spain and other countries who supply arms used in the conflict.
