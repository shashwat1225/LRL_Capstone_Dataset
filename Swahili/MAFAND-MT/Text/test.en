The Nigerian government announced Friday it was suspending Twitter in the country, just days after Twitter deleted a harmful tweet by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari that suggested the state would use violence against the Igbo ethnic group.
Despite removing the tweet, the message continues to circulate on social media, bringing up painful memories of a civil war that left more than one million dead.
But the tweet also sparked a movement on social media in support of Nigerians from the Igbo ethnic group.
In a series of tweets posted on June 1, 2021, Buhari threatened to treat Nigerians from the eastern part of the country in the language they understand, in a reference to Nigerias 1967-1970 civil war against the secessionist Republic of Biafra, in southeastern Nigeria.
The tweets came after a series of attacks on government and security installations in the region, which have been blamed on an armed group linked to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra secessionist movement.
IPOB denied involvement in the attack, says the Voice of America.
Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War, Buharis now-deleted tweet said:

The tweets reiterated comments made by a visibly irritated Buhari in the State House, Nigerias capital Abuja, about the wave of arson attacks on electoral officers.
I think we have given them enough latitude.
They have made their case, they just wanted to destroy the country, he said, appearing to reference secessionist agitators:
Buhari made the statement himself.
Buhari, a retired general, served in the army during Nigerias civil war.
The brutal civil war led to the death of over one million ethnic Igbos and other Easterners, according to Chima J. Korieh, a professor of African History at United States Marquette University.
For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event, asserts Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.
(Disclosure: The author is from the Igbo ethnic group.)
Twitter policy on hateful conduct prohibits tweets that promote violence or threaten people based on race, ethnicity, national origin.
Such tweets, like Buharis, are either deleted by the tech company or the user is compelled to remove the violating content.
Lai Mohammed, Nigerias minister of information, described the removal of the president's tweet by the social media company as very suspect:

Deleted abusive tweets are still visible
An investigation by the social media forensic expert Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) reveals that Buharis abusive tweet is still visible across numerous timelines two days after it was deleted by Twitter, due to Quote Tweets:
Over 30 hours after Twitter deleted a Tweet by Nigerian president @MBuhari for violating its rules, the deleted Tweet REMAINS VISIBLE across numerous timelines due to Quote Tweets!
Signing onto different accounts through different devices, DigiAfricaLab was still able to view the more than 17,000 quoted tweets made by users before the social media company pulled down the offensive tweets from the timelines of @MBuhari and @NGRPresident, both verified Twitter handles of President Buhari.
Furthermore, DigiAfricaLab was able to click and expand President Buharis deleted tweet.
Deleted tweets may still be visible to Twitter users because Twitter's software, also called, Application Programming Interface (API) relies on third-party applications that connect to Twitter servers via a URL.
Another reason, according to J. D. Biersdorfer of New York Times, was that deleted tweets may still be cached away and therefore available to show up in search results until the site goes indexing again and updates itself with a fresh copy of your Twitter profile and posts.
Backlash with #IAmIgboToo hashtag
President Buharis abusive tweet generated a backlash from Nigerian Twitter users who trended the #IAmIgboToo hashtag to express their displeasure.
In addition, Nigerian Twitter users from different ethnic groups also adopted Igbo names to show their solidarity with the Igbo people.
An analysis conducted on June 4, 2021 by Global Voices on the Brand Mentions app revealed that in the past seven days, the #IAmIgboToo hashtag had 508 mentions, 319,200 interactions, 457,500 reach, and 313,100 shares on both Twitter and Instagram.

Human rights activist Aisha Yesufu adopting the Igbo name Somtochukwu, meaning join me in praising God while condemning the 1967 [civil war] threats from President Buhari to the Igbo people said that an attack to Igbo people is an attack on me:
My name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu.
Any threat to Igbo people is a threat to me.
An attack to Igbo people is an attack on me.
I condemn the 1967 threats from President Buhari to the Igbo people
No Nigerian is more Nigerian than any Nigerian
Nigerian hip-hop recording artist and record producer Jude Abaga (M.I Abaga) expressed his desire for the country to move beyond these hateful statements:
The narrative that Nigeria hates Igbo people is an outdated context that will leave with the old and bitter generation
#EndSARS activist Rinuola [Rinu] Oduala, adopting the Igbo name Ochiaga, meaning leader of the armed forces, recalled with pride the important contributions of Igbo women in Nigerian history, referring to the November 1929 Aba Women Rebellion:
I remember the Aba Women Rebellion where at least 25,000 Igbo women protested against colonial oppression.
I come from the same land with those dynamic women, born of confidence & resilience to years of oppression & social injustice.
My name is Rinu Ochiagha Oduala.#IAmIgboToo
Blossom Ozurumba, Global Voices Igbo language translator, noted that violence always starts with dehumanization:
The use of dehumanization makes it easier to remove the moral concern associated with killing, discriminating, or torturing others based on their group identity.
If they arent seen as human, it is easier to justify acts of violence against them.
Dehumanization, according to Ozurumba, makes it easier to remove the moral concern associated with killing, discriminating, or torturing others based on their group identity.

On March 27, a heated debate ensued on Kenyan social media about utterances made on-air by three radio hosts during a breakfast show.
The hosts were discussing an ongoing court case involving Eunice Wangari, a woman who was pushed off a 12-floor building by a man with whom she was on a date.
On Twitter, angered Kenyans lashed out at the presenters Shaffie Weru, Joseph Munoru, and Neville Muysa for their remarks on the case of alleged gender-based violence, and called out the hosts victim-blaming.
Shaffie is insinuating that the lady who was pushed from the 12th floor of a building in Nairobi CBD after she said no to a man's advancements was because she was too loose & very available hence putting herself is such a situation.
What the actual hell!
The case divided online users as a section of citizens took sides with the hosts.
Although the trio was fired by the radio station, it brought to the fore how hostile the Kenyan online space has become for women.
There are about 21.75 million internet users in Kenya, or 40 percent of the country's population, according to 2021 data by research firm DataReportal.
Around 11 million of those use social media, an increase of 2.2 percent compared to 2020.
According to another report by Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), while mobile phone ownership is almost equally matched between men and women with only five percent more men than women owning or having access to the gadget , only one in every three internet users in Kenya is a woman.
As an online minority, women in Kenya are often targets of cyberbullying.
And although in 2018 the country passed a law against cyberbullying which defines the behaviour as interacting with others in a manner that is likely to cause [] apprehension or fear of violence to them or damage or loss on that persons property with penalties of up to 10 years in prison, mass online trolling still runs rampant.
Below we'll describe two other prominent cases of the past 12 months in which social media served as a platform to harass women in Kenya.
COVID-19 patient
In March 2020, Brenda Ivy Cherotich became Kenya's first COVID-19 patient.
After fully recovering, she came forth to speak about her journey just as the world was beginning to understand the new virus.
But Cherotich didnt receive the warm welcome she may have anticipated.
After doing media interviews in April 2020, she was subjected to online harassment and backlash from Kenyans on Twitter (or famously #KOT, a term often used to describe the collective of active Kenyans online known to rally against various causes or personalities) who sought to discredit and question the truth behind her story.
Other online abusers poked into her personal life, and her private conversations and photos were widely shared, probably after being leaked by a friend or acquaintance.
her hairstyle looks like Corona itself
Angered by this, Kenyas Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe came forward to defend Brenda, calling for the arrest of the abusers and terming the trolling as a shameful bid to undermine the government efforts to combat COVID-19.
Health CS Mutahi Kagwe tells police to arrest social media users for bullying Brenda
That wasn't the end of it, as another victim soon fell to #KOT attacks: TV personality Yvonne Okwara was targeted for defending Brenda and backing the ministers advocacy for the arrest of online abusers.
I strongly disagree with Yvonne Okwara.
Your statement is not objective.
It is emotional and stinks to high heavens.
Speaking of which where was your voice when your fellow women stripped a MAN (Lonyangapuo) naked and shared his nude photos?
This is toxic
Okwara called out the abusers for targeting women.
She pointed out that Brian Orinda, the third Kenyan who fell ill with COVID-19, and who was present giving his recovery journey alongside Brenda, didnt receive the same treatment.
This stirred the itchy fingers of the keyboard warriors who had a field day on Twitter trolling Okwara.
Playing gender card everytime.
Women should safeguard their dignity in the first place.
Posing for such photos and sharing the same is equally immoral.
Kind of shallow and idiotic take from Okwara.
So shallow, you wonder if Corona ate the brain.
Nudes of men were online juzi.
She suddenly has selective amnesia over that.
Earlier in 2021, State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena also fell victim to Kenya's cyberbullies.
As she gave a press briefing to journalists at an event, online abusers body-shamed her over her weight.
It quickly became a social media debate, with a section of Kenyans and media personalities coming to Dena's defense.
Shes too fat, tall,short!
Who set standards for how women should look like?
Why is it our problem that @KanzeDena has added some weight?
Well, shes a new mother, but, she owes no one an explanation!
Give her a break please!
This is a new low we must reject
An article by The Elephant, one of Kenyas foremost digital publications, noted that online social network spheres in Kenya and globally have turned to be the frontiers for toxic expressions and harassment.
There is no gainsaying that social media has become an important tool for social and professional advancement, more so for women.
Many women have built their businesses online and, in the process, have learned how to connect with others.
Many find clients to buy and sell their products online.
Others find platforms to incubate ideas, leading to hundreds if not millions of social enterprises that not only spur economic growth but directly empower young men and women economically.
They have also learned how to improve their entrepreneurship skills online.
No doubt then, social media has emerged as a great space to do business.
This is important for womens economic empowerment and visibility.

It seems that for women to participate in meaningful online conversations about topics that directly affect their lives, the internet must become a safer place than it is now.

Caribbean nations have, one by one, been readjusting their law books to reflect greater equity for LGBTQ+ people by decriminalising colonial-era sodomy clauses.
In 2016, it was Belize.
Two years later, Trinidad and Tobago followed suit, but the ripple effect of dismantling connected pieces of legislation has been slower in coming.
Three years after the court deemed the country's buggery laws unconstitutional, Trinidad and Tobago's Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) finally looks set to amend its regulations pertaining to sexual orientation.
The Act's self-proclaimed purpose is to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity between persons of different status.
To this end, an Equal Opportunity Commission and an Equal Opportunity Tribunal were established to handle such issues but so far, neither body has been unable to deal with matters of discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The current laws only cover discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, marital status, or disability in matters of employment, training, education, and the like.
Pressure to amend the current Act mounted after Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago announced on April 14 that it would extend its health benefits to the partners of employees in same-sex relationships, in the same way it already offered access to the common-law partners of heterosexual employees.
The announcement sparked a nationwide conversation and was praised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and Ian Roach, chairman of the Equal Opportunity Commission, who noted in an interview with the Trinidad and Tobago Newsday:
It is a good move on the part of the private sector and especially by the bank, who has a wide cross-section of employees.
It is important that the others should follow suit, past what the law insists.
Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has said he is encouraged by Scotiabank's inclusive initiative and remains open to doing what is necessary to address the spectrums of discrimination that exist.
Al-Rawi's stance is markedly different from his position after the 2018 High Court ruling; soon after the unconstitutional verdict was handed down, the state announced its intention to appeal.
While Trinidad and Tobago has undeniably made great strides when it comes to discrimination for members of the local LGBTQ+ community, homophobiamuch of it rationalised on religious groundsstill exists.
Public reactions to Scotiabank's announcement on social media networking platforms like Facebook were met with lots of criticism.
Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ people continue to face not just discrimination, but acts of violence, many of them ending fatally.
Most recently, the murder of Marcus Anthony Singh, a member of the local LGBTQ+ community, sparked online conversations about the reality that many LGBTQ+ people face in terms of both security and discriminatory practices.
Many of those conversations have been happening on Twitter Spaces, which provide an audio-only chat forum for safe discussion and education.
While Attorney General Al Rawi has not provided a timeline by which the amendments to the legislation will be tackled, for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies, the hope remains that moves by private sector companies like Scotiabank will soon be followed by the government, eventually leading to societal change.

For internet and technology companies, collecting user data remains one of their main sources of income.
But this business model includes a security risk for users, as demonstrated by recurring cases of undisclosed commercial use, massive leaks, and hacking incidents.
Is there a credible solution for strengthening users privacy?
Companies such as Google and Apple focus on collecting daily user data, mostly via smartphones, and combining information from the applications running over time: the user's contacts and agenda, for example.
A multitude of apps track the user's location in real time, while health and sports apps dig deep into their biometric information.
This data is collected and analyzed, allegedly to offer more tailored and sophisticated services.
In fact, most users do not realize they are offering a wealth of data to service providers and platform owners, free of charge.
Privacy activists, such as Austrian Max Schrems, have expressed strong concerns about this model.
They highlight the risks of increasingly frequent privacy violations and abuses.
This was perhaps best illustrated by the Facebook scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica case in which British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without consent, in order to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
Schrems says he warned Facebook representatives about the data-mining activities of Cambridge Analytica, but could not convince them to act:
They [Facebook representatives] explicitly said that in their view, by using the platform you consent to a situation where other people can install an app and gather your data.
But why would you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide, after all?
Whistleblower Edward Snowden answered this question in a Reddit discussion in 2015:
Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
Real risks linked to the use of information technology platforms
French software engineer and data expert Gaël Duval has been involved for years in free software development, including the Mandrake Linux distribution an operating system (based on a Linux kernel) which can legally be modified and shared with others.
Duval then decided to build an OS that would provide smartphones users with heightened protection of their data: /e/OS.
Global Voices spoke to him to understand how communication technology impacts lives, and present both an opportunity and a risk.
Here is his view on the evolution of such technology:
This is a philosophical question.
I personally have very mixed feelings about it because I've always been passionate about technology.
But at the same time, I feel that sometimes it's too much, and I miss the time when you had to find a phone booth to have a call.
It was probably a more carefree and [slower-paced] life.
Younger people might be surprised to know that until I was five, there was no phone at home and no television.
So sometimes I feel I lived a part of my life in a totally different world, that doesn't exist anymore.
On the other hand, it's really exciting to see what we can do with modern technology, like having an HD video call with someone on the other side of the planet, and seeing all those electric cars that, at least, are not burning petrol and [filling] our lungs with the exhaust fumes.
Besides the seductive dangers of nostalgia for those who still remember analog times, we are also facing a real risk of dependence on information technology.
A 2018 study linked behavioral problems in children with excessive use of smartphones, which was shown to cause issues including attention deficit disorder (ADD) and depression.
A survey published in 2020 by Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of teenagers in the Los Angeles area feel dependent on their smartphones.
The risk inherent in our use of such technology was recently openly acknowledged by insiders from the industry in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, which includes testimonials from former employees of Big Tech including Google, Twitter and Facebook explaining how they purposefully nurtured user addiction for profit.
Some governments have reacted by upgrading protective legislation in order to both raise user awareness and place more responsibility on technology companies.
In May 2018, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The law adds multiple constraints to data management, such as asking users for explicit authorization for the use of their data and requiring companies to remove this data after a period of three years without interaction.
It also introduces extremely large fines for those who do not respect these rules.
But its enforcement is limited by a lack of resources to do so among local authorities, and it is, of course, only applicable in EU member states.
A tool to empower users
This current climate convinced Duval of the need to create a tool that would allow people to take control of their own data, as he explains:
Our slogan is Your data is YOUR data, because our personal data belongs to us, and those who pretend that it shouldn't are either against freedom and democracy, or they have a business that is fuelled by advertising because personal data can help sell ads at a much higher price.
This is how the OS he created operates:
/e/ is a digital ecosystem that provides a smartphone operating system that doesn't send [to Google] any piece of your personal data, like your searches, your geolocation and that respects users data privacy.
It doesn't look at the user's data for any purpose.
It also provides basic online services such as an email address, some storage, a calendar, a way to store your contacts everything linked with the smartphone operating system.
Duval said that when it comes to personal data, Google and Apple are in the same boat this data fuels Google's business model, which is essentially based on selling advertising, while Apple, despite claiming to protect its users privacy, receives an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion US dollars each year to pre-install Google search on iPhones and iPads.
Duval added:
Using an iPhone, a user sends about 6MB of personal data to Google, per day.
It's double [that amount] for Android users.
Besides, Apple hardware is a closed box, without any transparency about what's happening inside.
You have to trust them.
We, on the other hand, support auditable privacy: all the /e/OS and the cloud software source code (the recipe for building the products) is open-source.
It can be challenged by specialists and audited.
In a context of growing dependence on smartphones, it is clear that protective legislation is not enough to raise awareness and equip users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their data privacy and this is where a digital tool that makes users more responsible and proactive can play an important role.
Information and awareness is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Kenyas COVID-19 vaccination rollout has been mired by allegations of bribery, line cutting and corruption that have left poor and elderly citizens waiting in long queues outside public hospitals even as the country grapples with a third wave of infections and deaths.
Meanwhile, hundreds of well-connected Kenyans are paying anything up to $100 to secretly receive early inoculations, as documented through eyewitness accounts by various Kenyans online and news coverage in Kenyan and international media.
In early March, Kenya procured over 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine distribution effort known as COVAX.
The delivery marked the start of a campaign to offer the vaccine free of charge at select public and private hospitals.
The rollout was broken down into three phases: healthcare workers and security and immigration officials, citizens over age 58 and adults with certain medical conditions, and other citizens in vulnerable conditions such as those living in informal settlements.
The country is set to receive 24 million doses through COVAX.
It plans to vaccinate 50 percent of the population by June 2022 through a combination of COVAX vaccines and donations from other countries, reports The Washington Post.
In a press release, UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman celebrated the arrival of the first vaccines in Kenya.
With the arrival of these vaccines, UNICEF and partners are honouring the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the global rollout of life-saving vaccines, she said.
However, this elaborately planned three-phase rollout fell apart as soon as the exercise began because of a last-minute government decision to fast-track phase two in response to the third wave, conflicting politically charged interests, and the states failure to consult and inform citizens.
In his article questioning what is going on with Kenyas COVID-19 vaccine drive, Patrick Gathara, a Nairobi-based writer and award-winning political cartoonist noted:
Politicians loudly and self-servingly argued that they should be given priority to inspire confidence among the population, even though the Ministry of Health was reporting encountering little resistance.
Because the state had ignored the need to explain its plan to the population, there was widespread confusion about where and when people were expected to be in line.
Despite government directives prioritizing citizens over the age of 58, Kenyan media reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have found a way to get the jab early, exposing the country's rich-poor divide.
Meanwhile, eligible senior citizens and poor Kenyans, who aren't well connected and don't have money to pay a bribe, often wait in line all day starting at 5 a.m., only to be asked to return the following day because the doses are finished, according to The Washington Post.
They have another door for their friends, Mary Njoroge, 58, one of the teachers, told The Washington Post.
Without a godfather to help you through this process, what are you supposed to do?
A similar incident in another government hospital was reported by @_Sativa, a Twitter user based in Nairobi, Kenyan.
In a Twitter thread, he recounted the experience of his aunt, a retired teacher in her 60s.
While elderly people waited in line, a nurse called out names and young people came to the front to get vaccinated.
When his aunt asked what was happening, the nurse gave her a number where she could send money, he said in his Twitter thread.
Following reports of increased enthusiasm from the public for the vaccination campaign, Kenyas Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe told the media:
I think somewhere along the line we seem to have developed some confusion that anybody can walk into a vaccination centre and get vaccines.
I want to make it very clear, those carrying out vaccination will have to account for every dose that they have used and that dose that they have used must be matched against an eligible person.
The National Nurses Association of Kenya president Alfred Obengo pleaded with Kenyans who are not on the priority list to avoid queuing for the vaccine.
In providing clarity on how the Kenyan government could have avoided this confusion in its rollout plan, Gathara concludes his article by saying:
Much of this could have been avoided if the Kenyan government and its global partners, including the World Health Organization and Western governments, treated Kenyans as partners in the rollout rather than colonial subjects to be brutalised and exploited.
Sadly for Kenyans, their colonial state does not know how to act any differently.

Under 2020 content regulations, individual expression is restricted by exorbitant fees and the government's power to remove prohibited content.

This article is part of UPROAR, a Small Media initiative that is urging governments to address digital rights challenges at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).
In early March, as Tanzanians began to speculate about the health and location of President John Magufuli, many citizens took to social media with their queries and concerns.
In response, the government issued threats of mass arrests to anyone who used social media to share false information about the president.
Authorities swiftly referred to Tanzanias 2015 Cybercrimes Act, and the 2020 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations (EPOCA) to arrest and detain those who violated its rules.
The government has often used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to undermine and clamp down on digital rights and freedom of expression in Tanzania, this time was no different.
On March 17, then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan revealed on state TV that John Magufuli had died.
Soon after, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania.
By then, at least four people had been arrested in different parts of the country for spreading false rumors about Magufulis health and location.
Many now wonder if Tanzania will review its repressive online content regulations in a post-Magufuli world, or whether these laws will remain firmly in place until 2025- the remainder of Magufuli's term served by Hassan.
In early March, Innocent Bashungwa, Tanzanias Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, issued a warning specifically to the media to desist from spreading rumors about Magufulis whereabouts, who had not been seen in the public eye since February 27.
Additionally, the Minister of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, also threatened netizens with jail time via his Twitter account for sharing nonsense rumors, specifically citing Section 89 of the Penal Code and Section 16 of the Cybercrimes Act.
Police Chief Ramadhani Kingai expressed specific interest in the Twitter account of Kigogo, a Swahili name referring to a high-ranking official, who often exposes government wrongdoing.
Human rights activists have condemned these moves and the overall climate of fear created by these regulations and subsequent threats of enforcement.
EPOCA 2020: Further restrictions on digital rights
Tanzania has experienced remarkable internet, communications and technological advancements over the last decade.
Nevertheless, the state often plays an influential role over Tanzanian media companies and platforms and independent media lacks diversity in terms of viewpoints and representation.
The internet created new spaces online for Tanzanias young bloggers and social media activists to make their voices heard, but the government has not welcomed this new reality.
In 2010, Tanzania first published the Electronic and Postal Communications Act, the first of its kind in the country.
By 2018, specific regulations regarding online content were released through Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, 2018.
The government argued that these regulations were intended to monitor and regulate citizens use of social media, in particular, and tackle issues like hate speech and disinformation.
However, the regulations applied not only to mainstream media but to individual bloggers and content providers, who were shocked by the new requirement to pay $900 United States dollars for a license.
This includes anyone who produces live-streaming TV or radio.
The sudden imposition of fees turned Tanzanian social media dark as many bloggers and content providers gave up due to the exorbitant costs.
Opposition politicians and social media practitioners critiqued the regulations for undermining online media freedoms as well as civil society.
In 2020, Tanzania released revised EPOCA regulations, issued under Section 103 of the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, adopted in July 2020, and announced through Government Gazette on Government Notice No. 538.
There are several main differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of EPOCA.
Firstly, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) recategorized fees with three additional sub-categories under online content: news & current affairs, entertainment and education or religious, furthering imposing restrictions on individual content providers.
EPOCA 2020, Part VI, Section 116:
Any person who provides network services without obtaining any relevant individual license, commits an offense and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of not less than 6 million Tanzanian shillings [ $2,587 United States dollars] or imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months or to both.
Secondly, the TCRA expanded a more detailed list of prohibited content including, among other things, content that motivates or promotes phone tapping, espionage, data theft, tracking, recording or intercepting communications or conversation without right.
Thirdly, EPOCA 2020 also reduced the amount of time that a license-holder has to respond to prohibited content violations by suspending or terminating an account.
Under 2018 guidelines, a license-holder had 12 hours.
In 2020, under Part III, Section 11, the response time is reduced to two hours.
Failure to comply within this time frame gives authorities permission to intervene, either by suspending or removing an account.
Global Voices spoke with several legal and human rights experts who have condemned EPOCA 2020 revisions, saying it undermines both digital rights and civil society protections.
They argue that these regulations further repress digital rights and deter bloggers and writers from owning their online content.
The biggest problem here is that these powers contain no safeguards against abuse, and with the current situation, they certainly have the effect of stifling legitimate freedom of expression in Tanzania, said one human rights professional who asked to remain anonymous.
Post-Magufuli: The future of digital rights in Tanzania
Under the Magufuli administration, civil, media and digital rights steadily declined with systematic restrictions on free speech online.
In the aftermath of Magufulis unexpected death, many now wonder about the future of digital rights in the country after six years of increasingly authoritarian-style leadership.
Global Voices spoke to several government officials on the condition of anonymity about the current regulations and whats at stake in terms of human rights in digital spaces.
One human rights professional in Tanzania told Global Voices, on the condition of anonymity:
The regulations are not fair as anyone can be criminalized, because not many citizens understand the implications of these regulations.
Another suggested that the government finds social media to be an annoyance.
He warned citizens to take precautions when speaking out on public platforms because the government can legally access all their details through the platform host.
EPOCA 2020 makes it virtually impossible to remain anonymous online, under Regulation 9(e), coupled with the requirement imposed on the internet café providers to register users via recognized IDs, assign static IP addresses to their computers and put camera surveillance to record the activities in their premises, according to this analysis by the Media Council of Tanzania.
These regulations reinforce criminal defamation, restrict anonymity, provide hefty punishments for violations and grant sweeping powers of content removal to the TCRA and intermediaries.
EPOCA is incompatible with internationally acceptable digital rights standards.
Overall, these regulations stifle legitimate freedom of expression and press freedom in Tanzania.
Yet, the Tanzanian government is obligated to respect and uphold rights to freedom of expression and association of all persons including members of the media, civil society, and the political opposition, according to Tanzanias constitution as well as international and regional treaties.
These rights are also essential to the exercise voting rights.
Tanzania is at a crossroads with digital rights.
Under newly sworn-in President Hassan, will the ruling Revolutionary Party continue to silence and repress digital rights in the country?

Moving Tanzania forward could not happen fast enough, when President John Magufuli took power in 2015.

Across Tanzania, thousands of people are crowding into stadiums, airports, and curbsides to catch a glimpse of the late President John P. Magufuli, as his body is flown for week-long ceremonial processions in Dodoma, the capital, the islands of Zanzibar, Mwanza, and Chato, his home at Lake Victoria, where he will be laid to rest.
Magufuli was announced dead at the age of 61, on March 17, in a speech on national TV by then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan, ending weeks of speculation about his health status and whereabouts.
He allegedly died of a chronic heart condition:
Death announcement for the president of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Magufulis sudden death has, however, left Tanzanians, and others, speculating about the future of politics and power in the East African nation.
On Friday, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania, making history as Tanzanias first female president, the first president born on the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar, and Tanzanias first Muslim woman serving in the top role.
Under Tanzanias constitution, Hassan will serve the remainder of Magufulis five-year term through 2025.
In a short video clip, widely circulated on social media, Hassan dismisses any doubt about her ability to lead as a woman:
For those who have doubts that this woman will be able to be the president of the United Republic of Tanzania I would like to say to you that this person standing here is the president.
[applause] I would like to repeat that this person standing here is the president of the United Republic of Tanzania, [and] happens to be a woman.
As Tanzanians mourn Magufuli and process this sudden shift, many have welcomed Hassan.
Opposition politician Zitto Kabwe, party leader for ACT Wazalendo, finds hope in Hassans history of activism and work as a member of civil society.
A very nice history of President @SuluhuSamia in 20 minutes, shared by herself [in her own words.]
She says she was an activist.
She was a public servant.
Thanks Chambi for making sure I see this.
Don't fail to listen.
Whereas Hassan is commonly known as a consensus-builder, calling for unity and calm during the transition, Magufuli was known as the bulldozer, a nickname he initially earned as Minister of Works for his efficiency in getting roads built.
Remembering Magufuli
Kanga honoring the late John Magufuli, Tanzania's fifth president, who died on March 17, 2021.
Goodbye our father, may God bless you / We will always remember our hero.
Many Tanzanians and Africans are remembering Magufuli on social media for both the bad and the good.
The Bad and the Good of Magufuli are equally undeniable, and it means the legacy he leaves behind is complicated but also valuable.
The pro-Magufuli and anti-Magufuli camps will never agree and the debate will go on for years.
Magufuli gained popularity early on in his presidency for his strong anti-corruption promise.
His efforts to boost major infrastructure projects and industrialization fed into many Tanzanians wishes for self-reliance after decades of international aid dependency.
Last April, for example, Magufuli rejected a $10 billion loan (United States dollars) from China for a proposed mega-port project in Dar es Salaam, saying only a drunkard would accept these terms.
This kanga promoted President Magufuli ahead of last year's elections.
It reads: Uliahidi Umetenda Tunatushukuru, in Swahili, or You promised, you delivered, we thank you, in English.
It illustrates Magufuli's achievements road construction (barabara), plane (ndege), bridges (daraja) and modern train (reli ya kisasa).

His anti-corruption focus also appealed to Western audiences, and the media initially covered his ideas positively.
To some, Magufuli is remembered as a true African statesman and pan-African putting Africa first.
Others remember him as a populist president who promoted nationalism above all else:
Been watching Tanzania mourning John Magufuli.
We denounced his autocratic ways, populism & sneered at his unscientific bent, but clearly, with the man and woman on the street, the fellow was quite popular.
However, Magufuli applied an authoritarian-style rule during which human rights and free speech increasingly suffered.
Over the last six years, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voices and others have steadily tracked the deterioration of the civil and human rights protections.
Tanzania dropped six places on Freedom Houses scorecard measuring democracy and freedom between 2020 and 2021.
When parliament in January 2019 debated the Political Parties Act, leading to a restriction of opposition parties, it was interpreted as a bad omen when an owl entered parliament.
Magufulis administration often used legislation like Electronic and Postal Communication (Online Content) (EPOCA), or the Cybercrimes Act to clamp down on opposition voices and public dissent.
Amended regulations in 2020 prohibited citizens from sharing public information that may cause public chaos or disorder and content with information about an outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease without the government approval from top officials.
Citizens couldnt speak about an earthquake that shook the coastal region last year, let alone the pandemic that reached Tanzania months later.
And during the two-week period of wild speculation about Magufulis whereabouts and health status in early March, at least four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the ill president.
Did he die of COVID-19, tho?
Magufuli reportedly died of heart complications an issue for which he had been receiving treatment for 10 years.
But Magufulis sudden death left many wondering if he had perhaps succumbed to COVID-19.
To many not the least, Western audiences Magufuli will be remembered for his COVID-19 denial.
Tanzania did initially impose restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus, but Magufuli repeatedly denounced lockdowns as a greater threat to the economy than the virus.
He actively rebuked international guidance on public health protocols like wearing masks, social distancing and vaccines urging citizens to use prayer and herbal remedies instead.
After Magufuli halted the publication of COVID-19 data last year in April, he then insisted COVID-19 had been fended off by prayer.
Soon after, he declared Tanzania COVID-19 free.
Though it is impossible to say exactly how COVID-19 has affected Tanzania, it did not go away.
When a new COVID-19 wave reemerged in January, many Tanzanians shared testimonies on social media of becoming ill with COVID-19-like symptoms.
Knowing that it could be punishable to discuss COVID-19, people wrote nimonia mpya or the new pneumonia and breathing problems.
But Magufuli doubled down with his anti-vaccination stance in a speech from his home in Chato, on January 27:
If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should now have found a vaccination against AIDS; he would now have found a vaccination against tuberculosis; he would now have found a vaccination against malaria; he would now have found a vaccination against cancer.
This was a major departure from Magufuli's predecessor, President Jakaya Kikwete, who served as global ambassador for immunization in early 2016.
Last month, Magufuli finally did admit that his country had a coronavirus problem, urging Tanzanians to wear locally made face masks.
It took the death of Zanzibars Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad, apparently, to break Magufulis intransigence.
Several high-ranking officials from the political elite and close to Magufuli have also died of the disease.
As throngs of people continue to gather to pay their respects to the late president, his death has also brought some relief.
Shortly after Magufulis death, writer Elsie Eyakuze came forward on social media to speak openly about what it was like to live through the pandemic in Tanzania, with a president who showed willful disregard for the coronavirus.
In a long Twitter thread, she wrote:
Now.
For the real story I have been at a loss to tell for too long.
#thread.
In March of 2020, the Covid19 pandemic started to rampage throughout the world.
It did not spare Tanzania.
But in April of 2020 we stopped all public efforts to halt is spread in the country.
In one of her last tweets, she asks:
Did he die of Covid19, tho.
Yes, he did.
And him, and her.
And them.
Tanzanians.
And beyond.
But they are not who you want to talk about is it?
They are not The Story.
It is.
A friend gets in touch.
Can you?
Wellcan I make it personal?
Please do.
I will.
Tomorrow.
In an open letter to Magufuli, Eyakuze points out the inconsistency of Magufuli's ideas, but also applies the empathy Magufuli himself seemed to lack, at times and forgives him.
Tanzanians are coming to terms with the complexity and gravity of Magufulis death and the legacy he left behind with a close eye on the future.
Who has the power to decide what does or doesn't appear on the internet?
That's the fundamental question posed by activist and writer Jillian C. York in her upcoming book Silicon Values,* set for release on March 23, 2021.
On Wednesday, February 10 at 2:00pm GMT, Jillian will join Global Voices executive director Ivan Sigal for a live video conversation about the book, which, as she notes in the preface, seeks to encapsulate the history of how Silicon Valleys major communications platforms created a system apartspecifically, a system that governs how we can express ourselves online.
Jillian, who is the Director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is also a long-standing member of Global Voices, where she cut her teeth writing about digital rights and freedom of expression in the context of the Middle East.
The session is free and open to the public and will be live-streamed on Facebook Live, YouTube, and Twitch.

The novel coronavirus was first reported in Tanzania in mid-March 2020.
But, after recording up to 509 cases and 21 deaths in late April, the nation announced its status as coronavirus-free in June.
That same month, Kassim Majaliwa, the countrys prime minister, told parliament there are only 66 active coronavirus cases in the country, but did not provide further details.
Since then, government has been silent on the coronavirus with a strong politic of denial and no data released to the public on infections or deaths.
Today, most activities continue business-as-usual, including Tanzania's tourism industry, attracting thousands of visitors to its airports with few public health protocols in place.
The airport in Zanzibar received the lowest 2-star rating on COVID-19 health and safety measures by Skytrax COVID-19 Airport Safety Rating, the worlds only assessment and certification of airport health and safety measures during the pandemic.
According to their report, new cases of the South African virus variant were confirmed in two travelers flying into Denmark on January 19, from Tanzania.
The highly anticipated annual African music festival, Sauti za Busara, will take place in mid-February in Zanzibar, with support from the European Union in Tanzania and several European embassies, despite the risk of highly contagious new coronavirus variants circulating in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.
On January 24, the Catholic Archdiocese of Arusha issued a letter warning congregants of the existence of COVID-19 in Tanzania, and urged members to follow all necessary public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus in churches.
While Tanzanias recorded cases are moderate compared to other countries, the governments silence about COVID-19 data raised grave concerns among public health experts and human rights activists, who are forbidden from speaking or talking about COVID-19 in digital spaces.
The country updated its 2018 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations in July, prohibiting any content with information with regard to the outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease in the country or elsewhere without the approval of the respective authorities.
Despite initial restrictions to contain the spread of the virus, schools, colleges, offices and other social activities are back to normal.
Even as the virus continues to spread in the region.
President John Magufuli had cast doubt on the credibility of laboratory equipment and technicians after secret tests allegedly performed on papaya and a goat gave positive test results.
The president said releasing this data was causing unnecessary panic and soon after, fired Nyambura Moremi, director of the national health laboratory, for allegedly botching the testing results.
The ministerial COVID-19 information team was dissolved.
In June, Magufuli thanked God for eradicating the virus from Tanzania, following three days of national prayer.
He made this announcement publicly during a Sunday service, amidst a praising congregation, making claims that God had answered their prayers.
He also praised congregants for not wearing face masks, despite calls from the World Health Organization to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
Magufuli, nicknamed the bulldozer for his tough anti-corruption stance, was reelected for a second time in October 2020 during an election that was highly criticized for stifling dissent and opposition.
Just before the elections, Tanzanians experienced an internet shutdown with access denied to all the major social media platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter.
To date, many Tanzanians cannot access Twitter without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Over the last five years, the Magufuli administration has narrowed democratic and civic spaces and has cracked down hard on freedom of expression and access to information in digital spaces.
With the governments strong denial stance, Tanzanians are not allowed to release any COVID-19 data that the government has not verified, which means that ordinary citizens as well as journalists and medical professionals are barred from commenting on COVID-19 in digital spaces, or accessing information.
Access to COVID-19 information has become an elite privilege, according to one doctor from the national hospital who spoke to Global Voices on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.
Unlike other countries with established COVID-19 information response teams who give daily updates on COVID-19, Tanzania simply offers a website with limited and outdated COVID-19 information.
The denial has been so convincing that its now widely accepted by Tanzanians, including medical experts, who disregard basic safety measures like wearing face masks and social distancing.
Global Voices visited major hospitals such Muhimbili, the government referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, the cultural capital, as well as Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma, the political capital, and witnessed very few measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.
People are allowed to enter hospital premises without wearing masks, there are few working hygiene and washing facilities and those that do exist lack water or are broken, which was witnessed, for example, in the pregnant mothers clinic at Muhimbili.
While the Magufuli administration has shown little concern about the impact of the virus on everyday citizens, many government ministries and departments acknowledge that COVID-19 still exists.
Tanzania's minister of finance urges ministry staff to take all precautions against the coronavirus, while also saying COVID-19 is not an issue in Tanzania.
Screenshot from Mwananchi newspaper.
For example, when Magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, authorities did practice COVID-19 prevention measures, requiring all attendees to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands at hygiene stations with hand sanitizer provided.
On January 25, Tanzania's Minister of Finance Dr. Philip Mpango urged his staff to take precautions against COVID-19 while at the same denying its existence in Tanzania, during a meeting in Dodoma, the capital.
Most in-country experts are afraid to speak up, fearing retaliation.
Global Voices spoke with one medical expert who believed Tanzania may be experiencing a second wave of the outbreak but that this information was kept secret from the public.
The expert did not want to be named, fearing reprisal.
Another medical expert told Global Voices under the conditions of anonymity that people must know their COVID-19 status so that they can take measures to prevent its spread in their communities.
He said that leaving people uninformed makes their job very difficult and hopes that all Tanzanians will try to protect themselves by taking all precautions advised by WHO.
He told Global Voices:
Politicians have taken over the whole COVID[-19] issue and they are playing a dangerous game, but when people will start dying they will start sacking medical staff.
Another doctor who spoke to Global Voices anonymously said that although there is some hope in getting a vaccine, Tanzanias denial may slow down access to it, as the government has not taken any steps to acquire it on the global market, opting instead to invest in herbal remedies.
In December 2020, Health Minister spokesman Gerald Chamii cast doubt on global vaccines, telling the East African:
It takes not less than six months to find a vaccine or cure for a certain disease.
We have fared on our own since the pandemic spread, I am not sure if it is wise to have a vaccine imported and distributed to the citizens without undertaking clinical testing to approve if it is safe for our people.
Access to information is essential to democracy and development.
Tanzanias cyber laws have been abused to target dissenting voices and those who have spoken out against Tanzanias handling of COVID-19.
Freedom of expression, including the right to access, receive and impart information, is enshrined in international law.
In Tanzania, the right to be informed, and to access and disseminate information, is recognized in Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Nevertheless, these rights are more cosmetic than based in reality.
With full-throttled COVID-19 denial and laws in place to prevent the open exchange of information and opinions on the disease on- and offline, Tanzanians are left with severely limited access to information and many are afraid to speak out.
This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries: Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Algeria, Nigeria, Namibia, Tunisia, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
The project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).

A document from the Mozambican Police (PRM) that has leaked in local media in early August revealed that 15 students had become pregnant at a police training school in Matalane, a district of Maputo province.
The document states that the pregnancies resulted from the students sexual relations with their instructors, without specifying whether these relations were consensual.
Moreover, it states that pregnant students will not be able to complete the course at present, and will have their trips back to their home provinces paid for by the police.
Finally, it says that the instructors involved will be suspended.
When asked about the case by the newspaper O País on August 8, Police Commander General Bernardino Rafael said that those involved would face disciplinary proceedings.
It did not take long before the case was widely condemned on social media.
Several users publicly expressed their disapproval of the school's measures, as well as demanding justice for the women.
Activist Fátima Mimbire wrote on Facebook:
Treat the Matalane issue with the appropriate seriousness.
I am heartbroken by this news of 15 pregnant students at the Matalane Training Centre.
This is serious.
It is serious because, as the document itself states, it involves the instructors.
Now, one person who holds authority over another gets them pregnant, and the outcome is a little process?
This reminds me of the teacher who demanded sex from students in exchange for grades or not to be humiliated in class because, in the teacher's view, they were dumb, instead of being prosecuted he was transferred to teach somewhere else.
And there, he continues his exploits.
Txeka, a women's activist collective, also condemned the affair on Twitter:
The Matalane case
Building a society of social justice, in defence of equal rights for citizens, requires a balanced education and development policy, valuing the development of citizens, with scientific knowledge and moral, civic and patriotic education.
The Matalane case
Blaming violence on women is a common practice in chauvinist/patriarchal societies, known for devaluing women and submission to the wishes of men, resulting in judgements about the victim's conduct and minimizing the aggressor's conduct.
University Professor Carlos Serra said:
Matalane?
Just the tip of the Iceberg, we are programmed to reproduce Matalane.
I imagine the day they start telling their stories, starting from the tenderest childhood.
It was similar for the journalist and activist Selma Inocência:
Few teachers are brought to court, tried and sentenced.
They are responsible for the lost childhood of thousands of girls.
School is not safe.
Statistics reveal that hundreds of girls get pregnant at school, some by tutors, teachers, headmasters.
A petition is also running demanding punishment for the police officers involved.
So far, over 3,800 people have signed it.
For the government, this case is serious and is being investigated in detail at ministerial level and by the General Police Command of the Republic of Mozambique.
The state should not and will not tolerate situations like this.
The law must be upheld and it is the same for all of us.
Nobody is above the law.
Investigations are underway to assess the details of each case, seeking to safeguard the psychological and emotional state of the pregnant women, because they deserve humane respect
Other cases
This adds to the cases of violence faced by Mozambican women, most of which go unreported by media.
Among the cases that have recently captured media attention is that of Alberto Niquice, deputy for the party Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo), who's facing criminal charges for raping a 13-year-old child in 2018.
Early this year, 30 Mozambican civil society organizations demanded the suspension of Niquice's inauguration, who was re-elected in 2019.
However, the deputy took office and is working as normal in the Assembly of the Republic.
Another case covered in the press was the case of domestic violence suffered by Josina Machel, daughter of Mozambique's first president, Samora Machel.
In October 2015, Josina was assaulted by her partner of three years, Rofino Licuco, leaving her blind in one eye.
Licuco was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in prison, as well as to pay 300 million meticais (about US$4.2 million) in compensation to Josina.
However, Rofino appealed the sentence and, in June this year, the High Court of Appeals overturned it on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence in the case.

African leaders have taken decisive, early actions to curb the spread of COVID-19.
In fact, the Africa Centers for Disease Control (ACDC) created its COVID-19 task force on February 5, before the continent had a single case.
Today, Africa is currently the least impacted region in the world, with 1,293,048 confirmed COVID-19 cases so far and a remarkable 1,031,905 recoveries, according to the Africa CDCP.
The continent has less than 5 percent of reported cases and less than 1 percent of all deaths.
Now, as African countries led by the African Union ease COVID-19 restrictions and prepare to reopen their economies and borders, many governments are employing innovative technologies.
A need for a unified, pan-African technology that can track the spread and connect COVID-19 testing centers across the continent has led to the use of PanaBIOS, an African Union-backed biosurveillance technology.
PanaBIOS provides a mobile and web-based app that uses algorithms to track and trace persons facing potential health threats and track and keep records of test samples from their origin to in-country labs.
The technology was developed by Koldchain, a Kenyan startup, and funded by AfroChampions, a public-private partnership designed to galvanize African resources and institutions to support the emergence and success of the African private sector.
Ghana is currently the only African country using PanaBIOS technology as it reopens its borders.
PanaBIOS ensures that travelers are able to use test results from one country to satisfy port clearance requirements in another country through their personal PanaBios app or by adding a system-generated SMS/USSD passcode to another travel document.
Port health officials use the enterprise version of the app to validate health declarations in a uniform manner across countries.
Comprehensive data protection and privacy laws
The African Union and the Africa CDCP are encouraging member states to integrate the mobile-based PanaBIOS platform that would allow results from facilities across the continent to be centralized.
However, digital health interventions have raised a lot of questions regarding data access and data privacy.
Government-implemented surveillance and control can instill fear and threaten civil liberties, especially in a continent where only 27 countries out of 54 in Africa have fully functioning data protection and privacy laws.
Some African countries, such as Ghana, have triggered new legislation giving the president emergency powers to fight the pandemic by ordering telecom companies to provide it with personal customer details such as subscriber database, subscriber cell reference data, uncashed subscriber mobile money transfer data, mobile money merchant codes, and addresses.
To ensure data protection and privacy, all machine learning techniques used by PanaBIOS are on aggregated data.
That is data gathered is summarized for statistical analysis not personal data used to target individuals unless its for contact tracing purposes, where it would be required to reach out to suspected or infected people.
To ensure the prevention of privacy infringement, the African Union, PanaBIOS, and its partners must propose how it will comply with various country-based data protection laws to protect privacy, ensure data consent and avoid data sharing for commercial use.
The app currently does not have a privacy policy available to the public, in which it explains to users its data collection and sharing practices.
The challenge is how such data privacy policy will meet the various, continental, national, and regional data protection laws such as the African Unions Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection, the Southern African Development Communitys (SADC) model law on data protection, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Supplementary Act A/SA.1/01/10 on Personal Data Protection Within ECOWAS and the East African Communitys Framework for Cyberlaws.
Tech-based solutions contribute to Africas COVID-19 success
In addition to PanaBIOS, various African nations have activated tech-based responses to the COVID-19 crisis to mitigate its spread.
For example, scientists from Senegal developed a $1 COVID-19 test kit and 3D ventilators for patients.
Wellvis, a Nigerian startup, created the COVID-19 Triage Tool, a free online tool to help users self-assess their coronavirus risk category based on their symptoms and their exposure history.
The South African government used Whatsapp to provide an interactive chatbot that can answer common queries about COVID-19 myths, symptoms, and treatment.
And in Uganda, market women used the Market Garden app to sell their goods from their homes through the app, and then motorcycle taxis deliver the goods to customers.
Africas successful control and management of the spread of COVID-19 has been attributed to its younger population, limited testing capacity and mortality tracking, and the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies found in some Africans.
However, it is clear that Africas tech-based innovations are a major contributing factor to its success in controlling COVID-19, in addition to decisive leadership early on in the pandemic.
Solomon Zewdu, deputy doctor with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation summarized how, in January, even as many Western nations hesitated, Ethiopia began intensive screening at Addis Ababa airport.
Rwanda became the first African nation to lock down on March 21, and many other African countries soon followed: South Africa implemented its comprehensive lockdown when it had only 400 cases and two fatalities.
(With a similar-sized population, Italy had more than 9,000 cases and 400 deaths when it acted.)
In contrast, the number of infected cases and deaths in the US is six times that of Africa.
Public health experts predicted that the pandemic would horribly affect the continent with bodies lying in the streets.
Clearly, Africa has proven otherwise.

Since September 22, news reports and social media posts circulating on the Chinese-speaking internet inaccurately claim that World Health Organization (WHO) Chief Scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said Chinas COVID-19 vaccines have proved to have an effect.
These reports and posts cite as a source a one-minute video produced by China Central Television for the Chinese video-sharing app Miaopai.
The video shows a speech by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the importance of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, followed by remarks by Dr. Swaminathan.
In the CCTV video, whose captions say WHO chief scientist: Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have proved to have an effect (), this is Swaminathan's speech:
As you know, they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial, so this is also of interest to us, so we're following those very closely.
Some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on.
However, Dr. Swaminathan's original speech has been edited.
Her last sentence, in reality, began with the word if, and the video's background music makes it sound as if she's saying proved instead of prove.
Dr. Swaminathan's complete remarks are the following:
We've been engaged in discussions with China for the last several months because, as you know, they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial so this is also of interest to us so we're following those very closely.
We've had very constructive and open discussions with them and they have always been reiterating their commitment to global access if some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on [emphasis added].
So I think the conversations are going on, it's still open and we're hopeful that more countries are going to join.
The remarks were delivered at a WHO virtual press conference that took place on September 21.
The complete transcripts of the one hour and 30 minutes event can be accessed here.
The conference aimed to present updates on the 18-billion-USD initiative by WHO and other organizations to deploy a future COVID-19 vaccine around the world.
So far, 156 countries have signed up for the program; neither China nor the U.S. is among them.
As anticipated, CCTV's video, as well as the news reports and posts that it generated, have attracted a lot of patriotic endorsements.
A post on Weibo by Daily Economic News has more than 337,000 likes.
Below are some of the most popular comments:
I am so proud of you, my country.
This is the best present for the National Day and Mid Autumn Festival.
You cant imagine Chinas speed.
I am so proud of my mother country.
China saves the whole world.
After fact-checkers pointed out that Dr. Swaminathans words had been distorted, some media outlets, including CGTN and CCTV, deleted their social media posts.
Among them is the Communist Youth League of China, whose post was captured by Twitter user @Emi2020JP before it disappeared from Weibo:
Tedros should have the vaccine injection first.
Like @Emi2020JP, many Twitter users believed that WHO was assisting China with distorting the video, and posted angry comments at Tedros:
Tedros is a toilet brush!
I will pay to give Tedros a few extra injection!
Yesterday my mom told me, the domestic news said that the U.S will buy huge amount of vaccines from China.
Let them live in their fantasy.
Such excellent service, from covering up the spread of the virus to marketing China's vaccines!
Although Chinese many posts have been deleted, copy-cats are still circulating on social media, such as this public post on WeChat.
Pro-Beijing media outlets in Hong Kong, such as Speak Out HK (and Today Review (), have also published news stories based on the video.
There are almost 200 COVID-19 vaccines in different stages of clinical trials around the world, and several of those are being produced by Chinese laboratories.
None of them has successfully passed a phase 3 trial yet.

Hundreds of Angolans took to the streets on September 12 in Luanda, Benguela, and in cities in 15 other provinces against police violence.
The demonstrations took place following the shock from the news that Silvio Dala, a 35-year-old doctor, lost his life on September 1 while in police custody.
According to the authorities, Dala left by car from the David Bernardino Paediatric Hospital in Luanda, where he worked as clinical director when he was stopped by police officers for not wearing a mask.
The doctor was then taken to the Catotes police station, in the capital's Rocha Pinto neighbourhood, when he showed signs of fatigue and began to faint, having had a bad fall, which caused minor injuries to the head, the official police statement said.
It also states that Dala died while officers were taking him to hospital.
The Union of Doctors contests this version.
The organizations president, Adriano Manuel, told Voice of America (VOA) that there are contradictions in the authorities explanations which suggest that the doctor was subjected to physical abuse.
Manuel told Deutsche Welle (DW) that the cause of death described by the police is not the real one.
Anyone who is a doctor and has studied medicine knows that this is not what killed Silvio.
According to DW, a source from the Ministry of the Interior said that the autopsy, carried out in the presence of the family and a prosecutor, concluded that the doctor was not the victim of an assault.
The union said it will take legal action against the police.
Meanwhile, the Angolan government announced the creation of a commission with the Ministry of Health to investigate the incident.
The protesters also did not believe the police's version of Dala's death.
Signs used at the protests in Luanda, in different parts of the city, said: No more killings, You are paid to protect, you are not paid to kill, I am Silvio Dala, They killed Silvio Dala.
There were also calls for the Minister of the Interior Eugénio Laborinho to resign.
The demonstrations were organized by the Union of Doctors and by various civil society collectives and organizations.

Since the beginning of the pandemic in Angola, several cases of police violence have been reported during checks on compliance with restrictive measures, sometimes resulting in citizens deaths.
Speaking to Lusa, the rapper Brigadeiro 10 Pacotes, whose real name is Bruno Santos, called for Lugarinho's resignation as well as better police training schools to improve their conduct.
The police is an organization that must give citizens confidence, today we live in serious insecurity where all citizens are afraid when they come across the police, he said.

Many took to Facebook and WhatsApp to protest the incident.
Activist and academic Nuno Álvaro Dala wrote on Facebook:
THE NATIONAL POLICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THE DOCTOR SILVIO DALA
The images are powerful and very clear.
We must all demand that justice be done.
The National Police must pay for the crime they have committed.
Things must not continue like this.
On Twitter, Isabel dos Santos, former chairperson of the board of directors (PCA) of the state oil company Sonangol, and daughter of former president José Eduardo dos Santos, said:

Hachalu Hundessa interview with OMN via Firaabeek Entertainment / CC BY 3.0.
Editors note: This is a two-part analysis on Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo musician whose murder incited ethnoreligious violence fueled by disinformation online.
Read Part II here.
Iconic Ethiopian singer Hachalu Hundessa gained prominence for using his creative talent to raise the consciousness of the Oromo people.
He was assassinated in a suburb of Ethiopias capital, Addis Ababa, on June 29.
That night, at 9:30 pm, as Hachalu was exiting his vehicle, a man named Tilahun Yami allegedly walked up to his car and fired a gun into the artists chest.
He was rushed to the nearest hospital, where he was officially declared dead.
It was later determined that the bullet severely damaged his internal organs.
Addis Ababas police chief reported two suspects were arrested.
After a few days, government authorities charged an alleged assassin along with two other accomplices.
In the wake of his murder, the country has struggled to come to terms with the violence that followed.
The truth of Hachalu's assassination is not yet fully clear, and in its aftermath, speculation began to fly as politicians and activists stoked long-standing tensions between Oromo and Amahara elites, two of Ethiopia's largest ethnic groups.
That day, mourners flooded the streets of Addis Ababa and cities and towns across Oromia state.
The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), a satellite TV station on which Hachalu had his last contentious interview, provided online and TV coverage as his casket was transferred from Addis Ababa to Hachalus hometown, Ambo.
The slow, televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where Hachalu would be buried, and OMN interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to Addis Ababa.
At least ten people were killed and several were injured in Addis Ababa.
The scuffle led to the arrest of several opposition politicians including Jawar Mohammed, an OMN figurehead, and opposition politician Bekele Gerba, who were both charged with instigating the mayhem.
Confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took Halachu's body back to Ambo by helicopter, where feuding parties continued to clash, denying the bereaved family members a proper burial.
Meanwhile, turmoil and violence ensued.
A three-day rampage gripped parts of Oromia and Addis Ababa, at a substantial cost: 239 people were left dead; hundreds of others were injured and more than 7,000 people were arrested for violence and property damage worth millions of Ethiopian birr.
On June 30, the government imposed an internet shutdown to attempt to halt calls for violence circulating on social media that lasted three weeks.
A number of people were shot and killed by government security forces, but several news outlets including Voice of America and Addis Standard reported that angry mobs from the Oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic, interfaith towns and cities in southeastern Oromia, targeting non-Oromo, non-Muslim families in the region.
Most of the violence fell along ethnic Amahara-Oromo lines, but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate, localized understanding of ethnicity: The southeast Oromo communitys ethnic identity markers usually combine the religion of Islam and the Afan-Oromo language.
A local farmer reportedly said we thought Hachalu was Oromo after he watched Hachalu's televised funeral rites that followed the traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
According to reports, most victims of the most gruesome violence were minority Christian Amharas, Christian Oromos and Gurage people.
Eyewitnesses say mobs destroyed and burned property, committed lynching and beheadings and dismembered victims.
A fateful interview
When news of Hachalus assassination first hit, Oromo diaspora media outlets zeroed in on Hachalus fateful interview with OMN host Guyo Wariyo, that aired the week before Halachu was killed.
During the interview, Guyo repeatedly asked Hachalu provocative questions about his alleged sympathy for the ruling party, interrupting him multiple times to challenge his answers.
Hachalu fiercely denied any sympathies with the ruling party, but also decried the deeply discordant and fractionalized Oromo political parties, demonstrating his staunch independence as a thinker and musician a quality that made him a target for online abuse until the day of his murder.
At one point, however, Guyo asked Hachalu about the historical injustices allegedly committed against the Oromo people by Menelik II, Ethiopias 19th-century emperor who shaped modern Ethiopia.
Hachalu shocked some listeners when he answered that the horse seen immortalized in Meneliks equestrian statue in Addis Ababa belongs to an Oromo farmer called Sida Debelle, and that Menelik robbed that horse.
This exchange attracted applause and criticism from commentators on Facebook and Twitter.
When Hachalu was killed one week later, many members of the Oromo diaspora community immediately speculated that Hachalus criticism of the Menelik II statue infuriated sympathizers of imperial Ethiopia, which may have led to his murder.
On social media, Oromo netizens focused obsessively on Hachalus Menelik-related remarks, which led many down a winding path to an insidious disinformation campaign.
The rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of divisions and contradictions within the Oromo community.
Throughout the interview, Guyo grilled Hachalu about the countrys ongoing political reforms, stoking anti-government sentiment with questions about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, himself an Oromo, and whether or not the government had met the demands of the Oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018.
Hachalu reiterated his non-involvement in the rabid partisanship of Oromo politics but he did criticize those who question Abiys Oromo identity.
He defended his position against top Oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a once-dominant party with historic ties to the now-defunct Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF).
The TPLF turned into an opposition party after Abiy dismantled the EPRDF.
Hachalu also addressed the political violence in the Oromia region, blaming both government authorities and the militant, splinter right-wing Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militia group (informally known as OLF-Shane).
Following Hachalus murder, the government was able to acquire and release the full 71-minute interview to the public.
The missing tape included Hachalus accounts of death threats he received from parts of western Oromia, where the radical OLF-Shane militia is active.
Hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked on social media if he had praised OLF-Shane.
He addressed a direct conflict he had with Getachew Assefa, Ethiopias security and intelligence chief during the TPLF period.
Guyo, who promoted this interview on Facebook as must-see TV in the days before its broadcast, has since been arrested and the government is investigating the full 71-minutes of interview tape for further clues that may help determine the facts regarding Hachalu's murder.

Screenshot from a Guardian YouTube video about female genital mutilation.
COVID-19 has deeply affected womens rights in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), from increased domestic violence to job loss.
But there is also one less visible area where women are affected: female genital mutilation (FGM), due to disruption in prevention because of the pandemic.
In April, the United Nations announced that due to pandemic-related disruptions in prevention programs, two million FGM cases could occur over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.
Female genital mutilation includes all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The practice, rooted in extensive traditions, cultural and religious beliefs throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, is typically performed by traditional midwives or healers using knives, razors or glass.
FGM, also known as genital cutting, is widely considered as one of the most extreme manifestations of violence against girls and women, and yet it is widely underreported in the Middle East.
It is estimated that it affects at least 200 million women worldwide.
The issue is explained in this UNICEF video:
In the MENA region, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a problem that primarily concerns Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Iraq and Djibouti.
Carlos Javier Aguilar, Regional Adviser Child Protection, explains more.
Somalia has the highest prevalence of FGM with an estimated 98 percent of females between 15 and 49 years who experienced genital cutting.
In Djibouti, an estimated 93 percent are affected, Egypt, 91 percent, Sudan, 88 percent, Mauritania, 69 percent, Yemen,19 percent and Iraq, 7 percent, according to the latest figures released in June by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
The practice varies according to social class, ethnicity and education in each country, with notable differences between urban and rural areas.
FGM more often occurs among the poorest, least educated families in rural areas.
In Yemen, FGM is concentrated in coastal regions but less common in the north.
In Iraq, the practice is more prevalent in northern Kurdish provinces.
In Egypt, it is markedly higher among girls living in upper Egypt.
In Mauritania, more than 90 percent of women from the poorest families have endured FGM compared to 37 percent of women from the richest families.
FGM: An underreported violation
The scale and scope of FGM may be underestimated because the official global picture of FGM/C is incomplete, according to a joint report from March, authored by Equality Now, End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network.
The report revealed growing evidence that the ritual is also practiced in other regions including the Middle East and Asia, and the world woefully underestimates FGM.
Small sample researches have recently shown that FGM is also practiced in Iran, along with Gulf states such as Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.
Divya Srinivasan from Equality Now told Reuters that she was particularly surprised at the results of small studies from places like Saudi Arabia and Oman, which are not normally countries that come to mind when you think of FGM.
The report, published during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East, was not picked up by the Arabic speaking media or translated into Arabic, with little coverage of FGM in Arabic at all.
This lack of public awareness may perpetuate the perception that FGM is not an issue of concern.
Social taboos
In the Middle East, taboos around womens bodies and sexuality prevent open, public discussions about sensitive issues like FGM, often tied to cultural, religious and traditional beliefs.
In Egypt, for example, Christians and Muslims both believe that circumcision of girls prevents them from vice and makes them more attractive for future husbands; mothers fear that their daughters cant get married if they have not been cut, according to a report by Stop FGM Middle East, a campaign created in 2013 to raise awareness about FGM and whose aim is to get the message out that FGM exists not only in Africa, but also in many countries in the Middle East and Asia.
The organization lobbies for more data on FGM and has created a survey toolkit to help individuals and groups create small-scale surveys on FGM.
Unless there is a critical incident that makes headlines, such as the recent FGM-related death of a 12-year-old girl in southern Egypt in February, people tend to avoid the topic.
Ghida Hussein, an Egyptian student researching FGM, told Global Voices:
As we dont talk about it, it is as if the problem doesnt exist.
FGM is often practiced silently behind closed doors.
It is happening far from the more educated urban centers of power where activists and politicians are seated.
FGM is a controversial sensitive issue and unless there is international attention and funding, it is not seen locally as a priority by an overwhelming male political class.
Breaking the taboo and speaking out about FGM can expose human rights defenders and victims to hate speech and backlash.
In Oman, Women's rights activist Habiba al Hinai, founder of the Omani Association for Human Rights (OAHR), conducted a survey in Oman in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been cut.
After publishing her findings online, Habiba received attacks and threats:
I posted my results online and the response was huge.
I was attacked by religious conservatives who say female circumcision is a form of Islamic worship.
In Oman, where FGM is not officially recognized, there is no protection or support for victims.
Habiba added in the report:
How can you ask a survivor to speak out against FGM and then face all the consequences criticism and online defamation, her family and her tribe may disown her, maybe her husband will divorce her without proper support.
I dont expect these women to speak out and face society.
FGM eradication: Too slow, too inadequate
In Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, FGM is only banned in medical facilities, but not in homes.
In Mauritania, there are legal restrictions, but not an outright ban.
In Iraq, FGM is outlawed in the Kurdish Autonomous Region but is still legal in central Iraq.
There have, however, been some major breakthroughs to eradicate FGM.
Following years of advocacy from womens rights organizations, Egypt banned the practice in 2008.
Sudan, in a political transition after 30 years of dictatorship, is the latest to outlaw FGM in April.
But law enforcement remains a major challenge because FGM still has a high degree of acceptance and prevalence.
Although laws are an important deterrent, they are not enough.
States need national, comprehensible strategies that include input from police, judiciary, clerics, health care providers and education to civil society.
A series of regional crises and authoritarian rule has delayed reforms, limiting campaigns and resources to tackle womens rights violations.
Now, with the world's attention shifted to COVID-19 and its economic impact, many programs that advocate for womens rights and provide social services to vulnerable women are postponed or no longer a priority.
With more families falling below the poverty line and girls taken out of school or forced into early marriage, FGM is also likely to continue to take place without notice in the region.
Abubakar Idris Dadiyata, image used with permission from The SignalNg.
Abubakar Idris Dadiyata, a lecturer and fierce critic of the Nigerian government, was abducted from his home on August 1, 2019, in the Barnawa neighbourhood of Kaduna, in northwestern Nigeria.
One year after his abduction, Dadiyata has not been found.
Abubakar Idris (Didiyata) was abducted from his home in Kaduna state, Nigeria.
His whereabouts still not known.
His family and friends are demanding answer to the question: where is @dadiyata?
Abubakar is a victim of enforced disappearance.
Dadiyata taught at Federal University Dutsinma, Katsina State.
As a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Dadiyata often sparred with members of the ruling All Progressive Congress party on social media.

Both the state and federal agencies are busy doing nothing
Dadiyata was forcefully taken by abductors at about 1 a.m. as he arrived at his home, a year ago on August 1, 2019, Premium Times reported.
Kadija, Dadiyatas wife recalls in an interview with BBC that her husband was making a phone call, his car was still running, when he was seized by his abductors.
Although Kadija could not hear what ensued over the phone or who he was talking to, she recalled that her husband's abductors had followed him, they even came into the house.
Dadiyatas wife watched from her room as they drove her husband away.
Sadly, theres still no information about Dadiyatas whereabouts.
It is painful, Kadija told the BBC, as their children keep asking about their missing father.
Rather than finding Dadiyata, Nigerian security agencies are absolving themselves from any form of guilt or blame for his disappearance.
Nigerias Department of State Security (DSS) had in January denied having Dadiyata in their custody.
The state security agency stated that since Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff.
Similarly, Aisha Dikko, the attorney general of Kaduna State, denied knowing the whereabouts or of being involved whatsoever in Dadiyatas abduction.
Anything to the contrary is a vile assertion that seeks to stretch the fact that he was abducted within Kaduna State to mean the involvement of the state government, said Dikko.
However, these denials by DSS and Kaduna State Government neither mitigates the agony of Dadiyatas wife and their two children nor does it restore his liberty.
The plea for Dadiyatas release still echoes on Twitter in this hashtag #OneYearWithOutDadiyata, as Nigerians demand his release.
Bulama Bukarti lamented about the trauma that this kind of impunity has caused Dadiyata's family:
Its unfathomable how a Nigerian would disappear just like that.
We must continue to do everything we can to get Dadiyata reunited with his family.
There must be no place for this kind of impunity.
Those that abducted Dadiyata will pay the price.
If not now, definitely later.
This Twitter user was shattered on hearing Dadiyata's wife interview:
I was shattered to hear Dadiyatas wife speak to @bbchausa, this morning.
All she is demanding is for his holders to forgive him and let him come back to his family; especially his little children.
Akin Akíntáyọ cannot understand how Dadiyata can disappear without a trace for a year:
One question, how can Dadiyata and his car disappear without trace for a year in Nigeria and the government be just so nonchalant about it, seeking exculpation rather than taking full responsibility for finding him, especially when they were a target of his criticism?
Unfortunately, it seems as if nobody cares about finding the critic.
Rather both the state and federal agencies are busy avoiding blame and doing nothing states human rights activist Professor Chidi Odinkalu in an interview with Vyral Africa:
Besides saying that they dont know where he is.Nobody has really made the effort to tell us what they have done to find him and how it is that they cant account for him.
It tells you how so little we matter as citizens.
The least we can do is ask where Dadiyata is and why cant our government find him.
School children in Kaduna State, Nigeria.

Armed bandits attacked a secondary school in Kaduna, northwestern Nigeria, on August 24, killing one person and kidnapping four students and a teacher, reports Nigerian online medium, SaharaReporters.
The gunmen who arrived at Damba-Kasaya village in Chikun Local Government Area, Kaduna State, at around 7:45 a.m. on motorbikes first raided the community, where they reportedly killed Benjamin Auta, a farmer, according to Nigerian online newspaper Premium Times.
The gunmen then proceeded to Prince Academy Secondary School, where they abducted teacher Christianah Madugu, and four students: Favour Danjuma, 9, Miracle Danjuma, 13, Happy Odoji, 14, and Ezra Bako, 15.
Happys father, Isiaka Odoji, told Daily Trust, a Nigerian daily, that the gunmen are asking for a ransom of 20 million naira (about $53,000 USD) to set their children free an amount they cannot possibly afford.
The kidnapped students in the last year of junior secondary school were writing their final examinations.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only students in exit classes were allowed to come back to school.
Both the federal and Kaduna state governments have remained silent on the fate of the abducted students and their teacher.
Its a normal day in Nigeria
Twitter user Ndi Kato called the incident devastating for the nation:
Today in Kaduna state, children in exit classes who were told to resume school were kidnapped by armed gunmen.
One was reportedly killed.Small boy, his life cut short.The others have been taken away and we may never hear of them again.
This should devastate any nation
But it is still a normal day in Nigeria piqued Twitter user Chima Chigozie:
Some school children were kidnapped in kaduna, one of the school boys was killed along the line.
The boys life was cut short, the school children are being held in fear.This should spike the nation but NO, it's a normal day in Nigeria.
Jaja blames politics for the absence of public empathy and outrage for the kidnapped school children:
The abducted Kaduna Boys will not get the same support and attention as the Chibok Girls because firstly, they are boys, and secondly, GEJ isn't President.
Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (GEJ) was Nigeria's president when, in April 2014, 276 schoolgirls from a government secondary school were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from the northeastern town of Chibok.
This lead to the global hashtag movement #BringBackOurGirls that resonated with millions of people around the world.

On February 19, 2018, Boko Haram also kidnapped 110 schoolgirls from Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, northeastern Nigeria.

The kidnapping of the Damba-Kasaya school children and their teacher is a grisly deja vu.
The only difference is that this time around, those responsible for this horrendous incident are not Boko Haram but armed bandits.
The rampaging bandits of Kaduna
Banditry violence spiked in Nigerias northwestern states of Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger, Sokoto, Kebbi and Katsina.
ACAPS, an independent humanitarian think tank, asserts that this armed violence is unconnected to the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast:
The banditry violence began as a farmer/herder conflict in 2011 and intensified between 2017 to 2018 to include cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, sexual violence and killings.
By March 2020, more than 210,000 people have been internally displaced.
Rural communities have been left at the mercy of these bandits who, between January and June this year, have killed at least 1,126 people in northern Nigeria.
Villages in southern Kaduna are the worst hit, with 366 lives lost in the first half of 2020, says Amnesty International.
Chikun LGA, the home of the kidnapped students, had experienced a series of militia attacks that has resulted in the deaths, abduction, with 45 communities displaced and occupied since 2019, according to the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union.
The people of southern Kaduna allege that the bandits are Fulani herders, on a land grab mission, with the passive consent of both the federal and state governments.
But Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai denied that the carnage had anything to do with land grabbing nor any ethnoreligious motivation.
On August 22, the Kaduna State government relaxed the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., which was imposed in some parts of the state to curb the banditry.
Nonetheless, Luka Binniyat, spokesman of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) laments that hunger is also killing us because we cannot go to our farms.Our people are helpless.
Poet Henry Swapon and lawyer Imtiaz Mahmood.
Collage from photos shared widely on social media.
Two people were arrested on May 14 and 15, for comments they had posted on Facebook.
The arrests have sparked indignation and concern on social media.
The arrest of poet Henry Swapon
On May 14, poet and journalist Henry Swapon was arrested at his home in Barishal city, located in south central Bangladesh.
He has been accused of violating Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.
A member of the small local Christian community, Swapon was previously sued, along with two brothers Alfred and Jewel Sarkar, for hurting religious sentiments of both Christians and Muslims on social media.

According to the Dhaka Tribune, Swapon wrote a post on Facebook criticizing Lawrence Subrata Howlader, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Barishal.
The Bishop had elected to hold a scheduled cultural program at a local Catholic church on April 22, 2019, the day after the terror attacks in Sri Lanka.
Swapon felt the Bishop should have postponed the festivities out of respect for hundreds of people killed in the attacks.
Other Christians were angry about the tone he took with the Bishop and some even sent him death threats.
Swapon has been vocal in social media against all the injustices and corruption in his town.
Netizen Swakrito Noman wrote on Facebook:
In Bangladesh, the tactics of attacking activists with the allegation of hurting religious sentiments had been a monopoly of the Muslim fundamentalists.
Now we see that conservative Christians are also at it.
I think those who feel this way hearing criticism are mentally sick.
The state should arrange treatment for these sick individuals.
We strongly condemn the arrest of poet Henry Swapon and demand his unconditional release.
The arrest of lawyer Imtiaz Mahmood
On the morning of 15 May, police arrested supreme court lawyer and writer Imtiaz Mahmud in a case filed in 2017 under the country's now-defunct Information and Communication Technology Act, in which a private citizen, Shafiqul Islam, alleged that one of Mahmood's Facebook posts had hurt religious sentiments and incited communal violence in Bangladesh's southeastern Chittagong region.
Imtiaz Mahmood secured an anticipatory bail when the case was originally brought, but a Khagrachhari court issued another arrest warrant against him in January 2019.
Mahmood had commented on ethnic tensions that arose after a Bengali motorcyclist was killed in Khagrachhari, prompting a group of Bengalis to torch a number of houses and shops of the indigenous people in the Rangamati area of Chittagong.
Local sources told the Dhaka Tribune that police had taken no measures to control the situation.
Hundreds of similar lawsuits were filed from 2013 until 2018, when the ICT Act was effectively replaced by the Digital Security Act.

If one sues them, is an arrest warrant issued immediately?
Many netizens have expressed condemnation against both arrests, with some demanding that the law should be repealed.

Absolutely shameful.
The Bangladesh government cannot ensure public safety but prompt to arrest people under the repressive Digital Security Act which is, by the way, against the very spirit of the constitution of Bangladesh.

Freedom of opinion is being restricted slowly.
I want the repeal of all draconian acts.
I want the freedom of expression.
I want immediate release of Henry Swapon and Imtiaz Mahmood.
Despite concerns about its implications for freedom of expression, the Bangladeshi parliament approved the Digital Security Act in September 2018.
The law replaced the notorious Information and Technology Act, which had also been used as a tool for silencing critical speech online.
The Act criminalizes various types of online speech, ranging from defamatory messages to speech that injures religious values or sentiments introducing hefty fines.
It also authorizes lengthy prison sentences for using the internet to create public unrest, and for gathering, sending or preserving classified government documents using a digital device.
The Editors Council of Bangladesh said that the Act is against the freedom guaranteed by the constitution, media freedom and freedom of speech.

The Act also provides absolute power to law enforcement agencies to initiate investigations of anyone whose activities are deemed harmful or threating.

In the aftermath of the Sudanese revolution, transitional authorities of Sudan have signed a peace agreement with The Sudan Revolutionary Front the main rebel group still active after former leader Omar al-Bashir was deposed last year.
The historic peace agreement, signed on August 31, in the city of Juba, South Sudan, found regional and international support from Troika countries, the European Union, Egypt and several Gulf countries.
But this exciting moment is also overshadowed by a period of historic flooding that has devastated parts of Sudan, causing a downward spiral in an already stressed economy.
Still, Sudanese citizens on social media also welcomed the news.

Yesterday's signing will put Sudan in a new momentum, on the parties, the Sudanese people, parties and civil society, in cooperation with friends and the regional neighbourhood.
We must create a solid platform for a new history for our country.
Sudans Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok welcomed the peace agreement, saying:
I dedicate the peace that we signed today in the brotherly State of South Sudan, to our children who were born in displacement and asylum camps, to mothers and fathers who long for their villages and cities, waiting for the glorious December revolution, the promise of return, the promise of justice, the promise of development, and the promise of safety.
The agreement guaranteed autonomy for rebel groups in their controlled areas under the supervision of the federal government.
It will guarantee one-third of parliament chairs for people from rebel areas in order to reflect their needs and issues.
The agreement will guarantee justice and equality for those who were persecuted by the former regime, often for being non-Muslim and non-Arab.
This is not the first peace agreement in Sudan history.
Some netizens say that peace agreements are routine in Sudan, and may not bring peace and stability.

Incomplete agreement
Despite this exciting moment, two main rebel groups did not sign the agreement: The SLMA), led by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, both refrained due to lingering questions about the mechanisms for integrating armies and the country identity.
Three days after the peace signing, Sudan PM Abdalla Hamdok traveled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to meet with al-Hilu to discuss points of contention, according to Sudan Tribune.
Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok on Wednesday held a secret meeting with Abdel Aziz al-Hilu in an effort to break the deadlock in the peace talks mediated by the South Sudanese government.https://t.co/IrNxxW9a0M pic.twitter.com/VgtyDZxfv3
The meeting resulted in the signing of a joint agreement of memorandum reinforcing the principles of the peace talks in Juba.
Sudan social media buzzed with a circulated copy of the agreement in English, with a particular focus on Article 3 on the subject of religion and state:
A democratic state must be established in Sudan.
For Sudan to become a democratic country where the rights of all citizens are enshrined, the constitution should be based on the principle of separation of religion and state in the absence of which the right to self-determination must be respected.
Freedom of belief and worship and religious practice shall be guaranteed in full to all Sudanese citizens.
The state shall not establish an official religion.No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.
Sudanese people split into two camps on the matter: The first sees the separation of religion and state as a guarantee of fundamental human rights; the second says the transitional government does not have the right to decide this without authorization from citizens via democratic elections.
Following the meeting, the prime ministers Twitter account published an Arabic version of the agreement that differed from the English one, addressed as a joint press release.
While the English document emphasized the separation of religion from the state as an inevitability, the Arabic document only recommended discussion of the controversial issue.
The differences between the two documents raise questions about the future of this agreement.
Historic peace, historic floods
While peace has brought happy news to Sudan, the Nile River continues to flood, ushering in an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.
According to a Sudanese National Council for Civil Defense report on September 8, total losses due to the Nile flood amounted to 103 deaths, 50 injuries, 5,482 deaths of livestock, 27,341 complete house collapses, 42,210 cases of partial house collapse, damage to 179 government and private facilities, loss of 359 shops and stores and damage to 4,208 agricultural acres.

On September 3, Sinnar state governor Ustaz Elmahi Sulieman issued a distress call on Facebook:
The levels of the Blue Nile this night witnessed a great rise accompanied by heavy rain, which led to the breaking of the covers and shields, a simple dam built by sacks of the soil, of the city of Singa and Umm Benin areas, and the water began to flood the city and its homes, as well as the neighbourhoods of Umm Benin.
Therefore, we launch a directive to all official bodies and an appeal to all civil authorities and organizations to come to the rescue of the citizens as soon as possible, and to provide shelter, medicines and food.
The situation is catastrophic:
Sinnar state | Singa city The situation is catastrophic after the rain broke out the city's water shield, which allowed the waters of the Blue Nile to enter the city.
Sudanese youth from Tuti Island have built a shield to prevent floodwaters from reaching the islands interior.
It was a heroic scene, described by Hassan Shaggag:
These are the ones who will build Sudan and not the ones who are fighting for power now.
Sudanese citizens lack basic necessities like bread, gas, medicine and electricity with power outages up to six hours a day.
The Sudanese pounds inflation rate has exceeded 202 percent, according to Professor Steve Hanke.
Yet, transitional authorities have not been able to gain control over the market.
Now that theres again the promise of peace, what are the governments plans to make life easier for citizens?
Student leader Jutatip Sirikhan covered herself in white paint in a symbolic act of protest following her release.
Photo and caption from Prachatai
This article is from Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand, edited and republished by Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Student Union of Thailand (SUT) president Jutatip Sirikhan has been arrested while on the way to university on September 1 for her participation in the July 18 mass protest.
Jutatip was arrested while in a taxi on her way to class at Thammasat Universitys Tha Prachan campus in Bangkok.
She went live on Facebook at 12:50 pm on September 1 when plainclothes police officers stopped the taxi she was in and delivered an arrest warrant.
Jutatip was taken to Samranrat Police Station.
An officer accompanied her in another taxi to the station, since she did not feel safe enough to travel in the private car the officers brought to arrest her.
She stayed live on Facebook and read out passages from the Thai translation of Thomas Paines Common Sense during the travel to the station.
She was then taken to the Bangkok Criminal Court and was granted bail and released at 5:20 pm in the custody of a lecturer at Thammasat University.
The Court did not require her to immediately pay the 100,000 baht (3,190 US dollars) bail but imposed the condition that she does not repeat the actions for which she was being charged the same condition given to everyone else who has been arrested and released on the same charges.
Jutatip is the 14th activist to be arrested for participating in the July 18 mass protest.
Fifteen other participants at the protest have also received a summons and reported to Samranrat Police Station to hear the charges against them on August 28.
Jutatip was charged with sedition and violation of the Emergency Decree and the Communicable Diseases Act, among other charges.
Jutatip appeared in front of the Criminal Court after her release and gave a short press conference.
Paint can be washed out, but we cant wash out injustice
I didnt intend to run away to begin with.
I know I have an arrest warrant.
I have been waiting to be arrested for a very long time, but it didnt happen until today.
Each time someone gets arrested, there will be slurs against our side that we did not protest peacefully.
I am a student and I have been harassed by the police for months, for years.
Why is there no compensation for me?
Why must there be compensation for the police who are servants of the dictatorship?
There should actually be a summons first, but what happened was that the police brought the arrest warrant and arrested me.
Its extremely unfair to a student.
They followed me with my phone signal, followed me from where Im staying.
They threatened my home, they threatened my family, they took a warrant to my house, so now we have to escalate our protest.
Everything is supported by the Constitution.
We pay our taxes.We must receive protection from the state, not harassment from the state.
So today I have to express myself symbolically that we can do this.
We must stand by our rights and freedoms.
Throwing paint is also something that can be done.
Jutatip then threw a bucket of white paint over herself while holding up her hand in the three-finger Hunger Games salute.
She said that the white paint represents purity and justice, and that they are demanding justice back.
We are showing that this is freedom, this is the kind of expression we can do.
Even if now it is throwing paint over ourselves, it is a way of showing that we can throw paint at any time.
We can throw paint over those with power, because those with power throw legal charges over us, throw bullets at us without exception.
Paint can be washed out, but we cant wash out injustice.
Afterward, Jutatip thanked the lecturer who came to make bail for her and the people who came to support her and helped the crowd clean the paint off the sidewalk in front of the footpath in front of the Court.
We wont stop fighting until we win in everything, including monarchy reform and a new constitution, Jutatip said.

While India is going through a major general election spread over seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 in order to elect its 17th parliament (Lok Sabha), some Indian voters have taken the unusual step of boycotting the electoral process.
Read More: All you need to know about India's 2019 general elections
In Goa, a southwestern state of India, residents of a tribal hamlet in Canacona block (district subdivision), Marlem Village refused to vote on 23 April during the third phase of the general election, alleging that the government had been oblivious to the problems of their village.
Their main grievance is that basic facilities, such as proper roads and water supply, have not been provided by the government.
A video by Community Correspondent Devidas Gaonkar, a member of the aboriginal shepherd tribe of Goa called Velip, documented the protests of the villagers:
In this video, Pandurang Gaonkar, a resident from Marli village, states that:
Tirwal to Marlem is a three-quilometres road stretch, which is incomplete.
To date, no action has been taken by the authorities.
They only make false promises, but no implementation.
For this reason, we havent cast our votes.
The residents of Marlem have been living in this village for more than 20 years.
In 1968, the Forest Department declared Marlem village part of a wildlife sanctuary.
This makes the construction of roads, or any development work in this area, a rather complex issue.
According to reports, an underground power cabling project for carrying electricity to the area had been initially approved, but when digging work commenced, it was soon halted following objections coming from the state Forest Department.
Another source of frustration for the local population is the absence of proper roads.
One has to navigate a 2.8 km unpaved and broken road to reach the first household at Marlem from the main road.
Finally, the supply of electricity and safe drinking water remain a challenge for the villagers.
Having publicly and repeatedly voiced their complaints, but failing to get any answers, the residents of Marlem, as well as residents from two other villages decided not to vote in the elections in order to draw the attention of the authorities towards their issues.
Polling officials came to talk to us, but our decision of not to vote, still stands, added Pandurang.
Isidore Fernandes, an opposition (Indian National Congress) member of the legislative assembly of Cancona, also met the locals.
After hearing the grievances he assured his support in favour of their agitation.
It is important for any government to provide road, water, and electricity to people.
Till now, all government officials have neglected these facilities in Marlem Village, stated Fernandes.
Boycotting elections is now becoming a way of protest, although voting is not mandatory in India.
Apart from Goa, villages in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, the western state of Maharashtra, and the eastern state of Odisha are employing this method in order to get pressing issues addressed by the authorities in charge.
So far, none of those boycotts seem to have translated into action on the side of government.
Ultimately, voters are adopting such tactics as a show of frustration towards officials and politicians who often reach out to neglected communities only before elections, in hope of securing their votes, but fail to deliver once the elections are over.
In the end, if boycotting elections does not heed changes in society, what else can members of neglected communities do to get the attention of those supposed to hear them and take proper action?
The journalist Amade Abubacar.

Journalists Amade Abubacar and Germano Adriano, who were detained earlier this year while covering the military conflict in northern Mozambique, were released pending trial on 23 April, 2019.
Amade, who contributes to various local media outlets including Zitamar News and A Carta, was detained on 5 January while he interviewed internally displaced people in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado, a northern province of the country.
Germano, a reporter for the local community radio Nacedje, disappeared on 6 February and was found to have been detained on 18 February.
According to the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), Amade and Germano were charged with spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.
The journalists were released from the provincial jail of Mieze in Pemba, Cabo Delgados capital, and will be on probation as they await trial before the provincial judicial court of Cabo Delgado.
Their first hearing is scheduled for 17 May.
Since 2017, groups armed with knives have carried out attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado, burning houses and decapitating residents.
More than 90 people have died since the attacks began, according to the police.
To date, no group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attacks.
In December 2018, the newspaper A Carta de Moçambique revealed the existence of a Facebook page, run under a name that appears to have been falsified, that praised the armed groups attacks in Cabo Delgado.
It unknown whether or not the accusations against Amade and Germano are concerning this same page.
The journalists defence team says there is no connection between them and any illegal activity via Facebook.
The proceedings against the journalists have been marked by irregularities.
After detaining Amade, the police placed him in military custody.
He was put in a military prison, where he spent 12 days incommunicado before being transferred to a civilian prison.
The journalists were only charged on 16 April, violating the deadline of 90 days set out in the Mozambican Law of Pre-trial Detention in the case of Abubacar.
In court proceedings during their pre-trial detention, both journalists were accused of crimes of violating state secrets through digital means and public incitement to a crime using digital means.
These accusations differ from the formal charges that have now been filed against them, which MISA described as spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.
During the 106 days he spent in prison, Abubacar faced a lack of food and refusal of medical assistance, according to Amnesty International.
His family told the newspaper @Verdade that they were stopped from visiting him during the whole time that Abubacar was in custody.
What has happened to these journalists may be part of a trend of intimidation against media workers in northern Mozambique.
Independent investigative journalist Estácio Valoi was detained in December 2018, also in Cabo Delgado on legally dubious terms.
He was later released, without any charge, but his work equipment remains in the armys custody.
Calls for justice
Cídia Chissungo, an activist and organiser of the #FreeAmade campaign, celebrated the news:
#AmadeAbubacar and #GeramanoAdriano are finally FREE after almost 4 months detained.
Ofcourse we have to celebrate but we won't forget how everything started.
We said a long time ago:Journalism is not a crime
Thanks for your hands#FreeAmade #CaboDelgado #HandsForJustice pic.twitter.com/Lhb0b1ALCi
Angela Quintal, coordinator of the Africa Program for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), commented:
Now to ensure charges are actually dropped and that #AmadeAbubacar can continue with his journalism without fear of reprisal.
The fact that he had to endure detention without trial for 106 days before getting bail is unconscionable.
He should not be facing trial at all!

Global Voices co-founder Ethan Zuckerman defines bridge figures as people who are passionate about explaining their home cultures to people from other societies.
The concept was developed through the deep roots it has in Global Voices, and defines much of the work and ethos of the community.
Since our Iran coverage aims to bridge the divide that exists between external perspectives on Iran and the actual country itself, Global Voices Iran has started a series of interviews with various Iranian journalists and writers who practice this role.
These interviews are done to understand how and why these figures, who make a career out of communicating the intricacies and complexities of a country riddled with contradictions, explain Iran to non-Iranians.
Golnaz Esfandiari: I think the use of social media in Iran and its significance is increasing
Golnaz Esfandiari is a senior correspondent at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and one of the few journalists based outside of Iran writing in English about the nuances and intricacies of Iranian society and politics.

In an interview with Global Voices, she said:
I think the use of social media in Iran and its significance is increasing.
Government officials admit that and I also see more people inside the country using social media sites and apps.
I actually think that since 2009, the use of social media has increased considerably.
Some Iranians told me they joined Twitter after reading about the allegations about a Twitter Revolution in Iran.
Social networking sites have facilitated conversation and the sharing of content that is banned or considered sensitive, people can discuss taboo subjects relatively openly.
They also challenge state policies and stances on social media quite regularly.
Kelly Golnoush Niknejad: You have to be a journalist, but a psychiatrist, professor, and mind reader as well
Iranian media entrepreneur Kelly Golnoush Niknejad is the founder of Tehran Bureau, a news agency hosted by The Guardian that covers Iran and the Iranian diaspora.
Her project is one of the leading sources of coverage that gives a dynamic view of the countrys culture, politics, and people.

Read more: How Kelly Golnoush Niknejads Tehran Bureau Bridges Iran and the West
On misconceptions that non-Iranians have about Iran, she explained:
When it comes to Iran, I often find myself having to go all the way back to 1979, then explaining the transformations that took place decade-by-decade, just to make sense of the present.
Its sometimes even hard for Iranians themselves to believe what goes on in Iran, let alone non-Iranians.
This explains why its vital to cover Iran from the bottom up, chronicling the lives of ordinary people.
Covering a country by reporting on the pronouncements of the ruling elite is probably the least interesting or informative kind of journalism.
Thats why even very sophisticated people who follow the news on Iran have no idea what goes on there.
Of course if they followed Tehran Bureau though, they would get a very dynamic view.
Nina Ansary: I believe women will be at the forefront of any change in Iran
Nina Ansary is the author of Jewels of Allah: The Untold Story of Women in Iran, the first book to cover the leading feminist political movements from the end of the 19th century to the present.
Jewels of Allah cover
The book explains how women have shaped Irans recent history, and continue to do so, while working to establish their rights and equality in a society that has traditionally marginalized them.
Read more: Talking to Iranian Feminist Author Nina Ansary on the Eve of Change in Iran
Ansary said she was cautiously optimistic about the future of Iran and the place of women in it:
only because I see their resilience.
And this is because female activism has yielded partial results: women were not allowed to serve as judges, but can now serve as investigative judges.
Women werent allowed to enter certain fields of study, and over the years they have been able to penetrate into male dominated areas such as medicine and engineering.
I'm cautiously optimistic, but I believe women will be at the forefront of any change in Iran.
Saeed Kamali Dehghan: They see Iran as black and white, and Iran is not like that.
Its a spectrum, its a rainbow.
With over 800 Iran-related bylines to his name, Saeed Kamali Dehghan is the first staff journalist at The Guardian dedicated to covering Iran, and one of the few Iranian nationals employed by a major English-language media institution.

Much of his reporting relates to Irans human rights violations, but as he said in a phone interview, the common problem in many western media organisations is that they see Iran as black and white, and Iran is not like that.
Its a spectrum, its a rainbow.
Read more: Saeed Kamali Dehghan on Covering Iran for The Guardian
On the difficulties of covering a country he has an emotional attachment for, Saeed explains:
As an Iranian I have an emotional attachment to the country, but when Im writing news I step back and try to be impartial.
But Im allowed to express my opinion when I write op-eds, and Ive also done that sort of thing.
I wrote about why Canada is getting it wrong on Iran, which led to the then Canadian foreign minister accusing me on Twitter of working for the Iranian authorities.
Ive been attacked by some people who accuse me of working for the Iranians and by others who accuse me of working for the Brits.
I hope thats a sign Im doing my job right!
Omid Memarian: To turn that explosive anger into something constructive, to put it into perspective and not take it personally, is an art.
Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist living in New York.
Omid Memarian was formerly a widely read journalist inside Iran, and now works in the United States covering Iranian news for both English and Persian speaking audiences.
Our interview with him explores the nuances of covering Iran for different audiences, and his experiences as a journalist both inside Iran and out.
Read more: Iranian Journalist Omid Memarian
Memarian describes his experience writing and reporting on civil society as a journalist in Iran:
There were, and still are, people in Iran who believe that by empowering civil society organizations, political parties and independent media, the Islamic Republic might change gradually from within.
On the other side, there are forces trying to prove them wrong, and one way to do so is by making the environment so threatening that no one dare stay active in the field.
When I insisted on continuing to what I was doing, writing and promoting the things I believed in, I was arrested and thrown into jail.
Hooman Majd: Iran is not uniquely paradoxical: what's unique is that most people dont know about Iran.
We are now at a turning point in US foreign policy.
Weeks away from the end of the Obama presidency, there is a strong possibility that the US is moving away from the defining project of rapprochement with its long-time foe, the Islamic Republic of Iran.
At the dawn of the Donald Trump presidency, which is slated to be a peculiar shade of hardline and hawkish Republicanism, I thought it a timely moment to sit down with journalist and author Hooman Majd.
His books, articles and commentary explaining the paradoxes of Iran became widely featured in the American mainstream media during the Bush era, when hawkish rhetoric against the Iranian government became a hallmark of the early 2000s foreign policy and media depictions of Iran.
Hooman Majd has been known to be the voice of Iran to the western world.

On whether misconceptions on Iran have lessoned since his 2008 book that aimed to dispel misconceptions about Iranian society to American audiences:
Ahmadinejad was the first to make himself available to the media, which is the source of a lot of the negativity.
But Iranian-Americans and Iranian-Europeans have written a lot about the culture in the recent years, and there's a lot more travel between Iran and the US, among both Iranian-Americans and Iranians themselves.
They are understanding it a little bit better and there have been a number of books.
Iran is not uniquely paradoxical: what's unique is that most people dont know about Iran.
Protesters in Rio de Janeiro: Our weapon is education | Image: Marianna Cartaxo / Mídia NINJA/Used with permission
On May 15, thousands of Brazilians took to the streets in all 26 states and the Federal District against the Bolsonaro government's slashing of federal funds to education that will affect dozens of universities and schools.
At the end of April, Brazil's government announced cuts of 30 percent on a so-called discretionary budget, which goes towards expenses such as electricity, water, general maintenance, and research.
When considering the total federal budget for higher education, the cuts would amount to around 3,5 percent.
Besides, the government has suspended funds for 3,500 publicly-funded postgraduate scholarships.
From Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, a traditional gathering spot for protests, to far away indigenous lands in Alto Rio Negro, near the border with Colombia, people went out to defend their public education.
In Viçosa, Minas Gerais, a crowd of around 5,000 people marched with umbrellas under heavy rain.
Drone footage of the huge crowd of protestors gathered on on Av Paulista in São Paulo to protest the education & science funding cuts.#15M #TodosPelaEducação #TsunamidaEducação #NaRuaPelaEducação #MarchaPelaCiência pic.twitter.com/BmHEYBuF9F
https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WhatsApp-Video-2019-05-15-at-21.00.30.mp4
Brazil has 69 federal universities and a large number of state universities, all offering undergraduate and postgraduate education completely free of tuition, and several community-oriented services such as extension courses, legal assistance offices, and hospitals.
Initially, the cuts would apply to only three federal universities, but they were later extended to the entire federal network.
Bolsonaro's Education Minister Abraham Weintraub says that they're not cuts but a contingency of expenses.
Weintraub has justified the cuts because public universities are places of mayhem.
When asked by reporters to name examples of such mayhem, he mentioned the presence of social movements in campuses, and parties with naked people.
Weintraub was appointed as minister in early April after his short-lived predecessor's administration became involved in a series of controversies.
The new minister often voices rightwing conspiracy theories, such as that crack cocaine was introduced in Brazil as part of a communist plot, and that he wants to erase cultural Marxism from universities.
Some university deans have said that the cuts might impede them from opening their doors as early as the second semester of 2019.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office has sent a report to the attorney general claiming the cuts violate Brazil's Constitution.
Rio de Janeiro you look BEAUTIFUL!
Hundreds of thousands are occupying Avenida Presidente Vargas as night falls to protest the budget cuts to science and education.#15M #TodosPelaEducação #TsunamidaEducação #NaRuaPelaEducação pic.twitter.com/8MIn91crKX
Researchers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) who study WhatsApp groups in Brazil have detected conversations around universities on that messaging app in the days following the budget cut's announcement.
The study has developed a tool that monitors WhatsApp groups and is widely used by fact-checking agencies in Brazil.
Lead researcher Fabrício Benevuto said on a Facebook post on May 8:
[The images include] monographies/dissertation/events mocked by their titles and topics.
There are images of naked people in parties (that aren't even in universities) and protests and memes that say university students take 12 years to graduate because they're on drugs all the time.
It's clearly an orchestrated effort.A professional's job.
It's the same style of the electoral campaign.
Who finances this factory of disinformation?
An article by website Ciência na Rua (science in the streets in Portuguese) claims that public universities produce 95 percent of scientific research in Brazil.
A study by the United States consultancy Clarivate Analytics in 2018 points out that on the top 20 universities with the most prominent research production, 15 are part of the federal network.
On the day of the protests, Minister Weintraub was summoned to testify about the budget cuts in the lower house of Congress.
Bolsonaro is the enemy of Education
Education is an act of Love and Courage#TsunamiDaEducacao pic.twitter.com/sEEOb5wDxz
Meanwhile, Bolsonaro was in Texas, in the United States, where he met former US president George W. Bush.
When asked about the protests, the president said:
Its natural [that protests happen], now, the majority of people there are militants with nothing inside their heads.
If you ask the result of 7 times 8, they wont know.
If you ask about the composition of water, they wont know, they know nothing.
They are useful idiots, imbeciles, and are being manipulated by a canny minority that commands many federal universities in Brazil.
Ugandan journalist Gertrude Uwitware Tumusiime has experienced the double burden of working as a woman journalist in Uganda.

In Uganda, female journalists who embrace digital tools to report, share views and access information face attacks and harassment for investigating and publishing sensitive political content.
Online harassment has become a new form of censorship.
Women journalists carry the double burden of gender-based abuse online in addition to potential threats related to political reporting.
These ongoing threats have led women journos to withdraw from public discourse leaving the journalism profession dominated by men.

In November 2016, Ugandan journalist Joy Doreen Biira, who was working at the privately-owned Kenya Television Network (KTN) in Kenya, returned home to Uganda for a traditional ceremony.
While Biira was home, Ugandan security forces clashed with members of the traditional Rwenzururu kingdom in the Rwenzori region of western Uganda, and their palace was burned to the ground.
The gunbattle resulted in 62 deaths, including 16 policemen.
Biira reacted to the military raid by posting her thoughts on Facebook on November 27:
Its so sad what Ive witnessed today with my own eyes part of the palace of the kingdom Im from, the Rwenzururu Kingdom, burning down.
It felt like watching your heritage deplete before my eyes.
That same day, Biira was arrested and accused of circulating graphic photos of the aftermath of a deadly battle between security forces and the regional kings royal guard of the Rwenzururu kingdom to a widely subscribed WhatsApp group, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
She also posted an Instagram video of the king's palace burning and wrote about it on Facebook, CPJ reported.
Uganda security officers allegedly forced Biira to delete social media posts and her digital tools were also confiscated, according to a 2018 Freedom House report.
Biira was charged with abetting terrorism for illegal filming of a military raid on a regional kings palace an act punishable by death under the Anti-Terrorism Act if convicted.
However, a day later, she was released on bail.
Biiras ordeal sparked condemnation on social media through hashtags such as #FreeJoyDoreen and #JournalismIsNotaCrime.
This netizen criticized Ugandan President Yoweri Musevenis tendency to silence journalists:
#FreeJoyDoreen President @KagutaMuseveni should stop silencing journalists.
That is total impunity in our continent pic.twitter.com/SGUX985cM0
Biiras lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, posted a tweet of Biiras official charges:
Copy of Joy's police bond charged with abetting terrorism (ridiculous!)
#journalism is not terrorism @KTNKenya @KTNKenya #FreeJoyDoreen pic.twitter.com/g5v7cgGryn
Opiyo told Global Voices that Biiras case was dropped and closed in March 2017 after authorities investigated it and found no evidence to charge her in a court of law.
Like many such cases, one is reviewed to be free but left with a sense of unfairness, injustice, and pain, said Opiyo, who is also the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda, a human rights organization.
Opiyo added that spending a few days in jail and enduring the pain of being locked up never leaves you.
Targeted online attacks
Women journalists who experience abuse online rarely see justice and often struggle to have their complaints taken seriously and properly investigated.
In April 2017, Gertrude Tumusiime Uwitware, a news anchor at NTV Uganda, defended Stella Nyanzi, an outspoken professor who criticized the Museveni administration for failing to fulfill a campaign promise to distribute sanitary pads to poor girls.
Authorities forced Uwitware to delete her Twitter and Facebook posts with comments in support of Nyanzi.
She received threats on Facebook and was then abducted by unknown assailants for at least eight hours, according to a 2017 Uganda human rights report.
Her kidnappers allegedly interrogated her about her connection with Nyanzi, badly bit her and cut her hair.

Uwitware was later found at a police station in Kampala.
However, authorities have not released any updates on the investigation into her kidnapping.
Political journalists especially those who cover opposition politics often experience threats more than any other kind of journalism.
But women journalists have it worse because the government believes they are weaker and easily intimidated, according to Mukose Arnold Anthony, Secretary for Media Safety and Human Rights of the Uganda Journalists Association (UJA), who spoke to Global Voices via WhatsApp on April 3.
When it comes to sexual harassment online, female journalists fear to open upalthough a few disclose the majority end up dying silently, Anthony said.
Women journalists may face extra psychological harm, breach of privacy, loss of identity, limitation of mobility, censorship, and loss of property as a result of their work, according to a UNESCO study on freedom of expression in Africa published in 2018.
And, according to a Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda 2018 study, 12 percent of women journalists have suffered abuses and violations, including death threats and arrests.
Three-quarters of women journalists suffered violations at the hands of state agents such as the police, resident district commissioners and other security operatives.
Attacks and harassment
Ugandan journalist Bahati Remmy has faced attacks and harassment on the job as a female reporter.

Bahati Remmy, a Ugandan female journalist who now works in the United States, told Global Voices that she quit reporting news in Uganda because she felt jaded after her horrific ordeal while covering the elections in Uganda in 2016.
Ugandan police arrested Remmy while doing a live broadcast for the privately-owned NBS TV to cover the house arrest of opposition politician Dr. Kizza Besigye in the town of Kasangati.
Remmy told Global Voices:
The police engaged in a running battle not to allow any journalists to cover the story concerning Besigye.
Police fondled her breasts in the police van, undressed her at the station and exposed her naked body to a camera, according to Remmy.
She was also followed and harassed by a police officer on Facebook because the Ugandan government thought she had connived with Besigye to taint the countrys image.
She told Global Voices that anonymous notes left at her door threatened to kidnap her if she refused to reveal Besigyes exit route from his house.
In the aftermath of Remmys arrest, Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda took a poll to gauge public opinion about the ordeal.
They asked: Uganda police claimed that NBS TV reporter Bahati Remmy disobeyed lawful orders and also obstructed police officers on duty hence her arrest?
Do you agree?

It is a lame excuse and total lie because there is video footage that shows how Bahati was arrested.
Police should stop shifting their problems to innocent journalists.
Davide Lubuurwa wrote:
Whoever tries to let the people know how the state is standing is to be arrested.
A very big problem is coming to Uganda soon.
What bothers me most is that whoever tries to say something that is not in support of the current regime is taken to be a rebel so the Ugandan people must wake up.
Many women journalists in Uganda have stopped reporting stories that are critical of the government because they fear attacks and harassment by the state.
Media practitioners have said that government and security agents occasionally call editors and instruct them to not to publish stories that negatively portray the government.
These attacks often go unreported especially for women which has also made it difficult to understand the full scope of this problem.
Remmy dragged the Ugandan government to the Uganda Human Rights Commission, but until today, there has been no update on her case.
The commission lacks the required independence to rule in favor of those who submit complaints against the government.
Its seven members, including its chairperson, are appointed by the president, with the parliaments approval.
They are biased, Remmy said, adding: They have a huge backlog and most of the cases they want to hear are cases brought in by the government.
Many threats faced by women journalists online are closely linked to abuse offline.
Remmy believes that the right, plight and dignity of female journalists should be upheld at all times because attacks on women silence the media as a whole.
As Uganda plans to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021, attacks and harassment of women journalists by the state need to stop because it affects access to information, freedom of expression and democracy rights of Ugandan citizens.
Press freedom remains an undermined child in the countrys system, Remmy told Global Voices.

Editors note: This personal essay was written following a Twitter campaign organized by Global Voices sub-Saharan Africa and Rising Voices where each week, a different language activist shared their perspectives on the intersection of digital rights and African Languages as part of the project, The identity matrix: Platform regulation of online threats to expression in Africa.
According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), linguistic and cultural diversity are of strategic importance for people around the world to strengthen the unity and cohesion of societies.
This linguistic and cultural diversity propelled the UNESCO general conference to proclaim International Mother Language Day (IMLD) in November 1999, to be commemorated annually on February 21 annually.
To bolster IMLD, the United Nations (UN) declared the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL 2019), to draw attention to the endangerment of the worlds indigenous languages.
Today, there are over 7,100 languages spoken around the world, 28 percent of which are spoken on the African continent alone.
Despite this, English dominates online spaces in the region.
Some twenty years ago, 80 percent of the worlds online content was English-centric.
Currently, however, English content online is said to have shrunk to between 51- 55 percent.
The million-dollar question, therefore, is: Could this sharp drop be an indicator that people now favor their native languages online over English, considering that less than 15 percent of the world population speaks English as their first language?
Swahili: Coming to birth?
Swahili is recognized as one of the official languages of the African Union (AU), alongside English, Portuguese, French, Spanish and Arabic.
Swahili is also the lingua franca for East Africa Community (EAC) member states.
Rwanda, an EAC member, saw its lower legislative house approve a law making Swahili an official language in 2017 in addition to Kinyarwanda, French and English.
Besides being used for administrative purposes, Swahili will be incorporated into Rwandas school curriculum.
In Uganda, the government in September 2019 approved the establishment of the National Swahili Council.
Article 6 (2) of the Constitution of Uganda also spells out that Swahili shall be the second official language in Uganda to be used in such circumstances as Parliament may by law prescribe.
In 2018, South Africa, which boasts 11 official languages, formalized Swahili as an optional subject in its curriculum, starting in 2020.
In 2019, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) adopted Swahili as its fourth official language.
Swahili invisibility online

Despite Swahili being the most widely spoken African language, with approximately 150 million speakers mostly in East Africa, the Great Lakes region, southern Somalia, and some parts of Southern Africa, its visibility online is dismal.
John Walubengo, a lecturer at the Multimedia University of Kenya, states in an op-ed with the Nation, a Kenyan daily, that the absence of online linguistic and cultural diversity creates a society with a tunnel-vision view of the world.
Walubengo predicts that most indigenous cultures end up surrendering their identities to the English way of doing things.
This sad reality can only be reversed if indigenous civilizations fight to retain their identities both online and offline, he says.
But all is not gloom and doom.
There are some dedicated organizations at the forefront of promoting and developing Swahili online.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), a global multi-stakeholder organization that coordinates Internet Domain Name System (DNS), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and autonomous system numbers, instituted the Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that enable people to use domain names in local languages and scripts.
Ideally, they are formed using characters from different scripts, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Cyrillic.These are then encoded by the Unicode standard and used as allowed by relevant IDN protocols, a set of standards defined by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and its subsidiary groups; the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
The Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG)
UASG is a community-based team of industry leaders, supported by ICANN, that prepares online communities for the next billion internet users.
This is achieved through a process known as Universal Acceptance (UA) that ensures that internet applications and systems treat all top-level domains (TLDs) and emails based on those domains in a consistent manner including those in non-Latin-based languages and those that are more than three characters long.
UA serves digital natives around the world in their local languages and with domain names that better align with their cultural identities.
Hence, promoting a multilingual Internet.
ICANNWiki
This nonprofit organization provides community-developed wiki on ICANN and Internet Governance, has over time partnered with organizations, educational institutions and individuals in Kenya and Tanzania.
This has enabled East Africans to build, translate and add Wiki resources in their own vision, language and perspective.
This Swahili initiative that I have personally been part of has immensely bridged the information gap on Internet Governance issues by localizing ICANNWiki content to promote local engagement in the target communities.
Localization Lab
Localization Lab is a global community of volunteer collaborators who support the translation and localization of digital safety tutorials and tools like TOR, Signal, OONI, Psiphon.
These technologies address security, privacy and anonymity online by ensuring that indigineous language activists have safe spaces for accessing information online.
Localization Lab has translated more than 60 of these safety tools into over 180 different languages and dialects from around the world, among them Swahili.
Kondoa Community Network (KCN)
KCN is the first community network to pilot the use of television white space (TVWS), a wireless technology that employs unused parts of the radio spectrum in the 470 to 790 MHz frequency band to address internet connectivity in rural Tanzania.
KCN trains the rural populace to create and host local content thats befitting to their context.
Matogoro Jabhera, KCN founder and lecturer at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania, told Global Voices in a Skype call, that he believes that local content provides an incentive for more [of the] offline population to get online because they can relate with their local news [] compared to the current situation where most contents are in the English language.
The next billion multilingual users on the internet
The world anticipates connecting the next billion users of the internet and 17 million of these users are projected to get connected online using language as their digital identity.
Therefore, a lack of sufficient local content could have adverse effects as far as digital inclusion.
This will outrightly affect digital rights largely, internet access, right to access information online, and the right to use their own indigenous language to create, share and disseminate information and knowledge through the internet.
It is thus vital to put in place formidable action plans that will foster the development of ICT applications and services, as well as the use of local languages, to guarantee digital inclusion for all.
This, complemented by actions such as localization of digital training and learning materials, and rural ICT literacy programs, is likely to spur a digital revolution, hence promoting digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide.
Ultimately, this process will hasten the protection, respect and promotion of all African and minority languages on the internet as enunciated in the principles of the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom.

Building on Writing Toward Freedom: Politics and digital rights in Africa, this five-week social media outreach initiative will involve a curated dialogue on @GVSSAfrica featuring five African language activists who will focus on the intersection of language and digital rights.
Identity Matrix is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).
Global Voices is part of the grantees for the African Digital Rights Fund.
The activists will tweet in African languages like Bambara, Igbo, Khoekhoe, N|uu, Swahili, Yorùbá, in addition to French and English.
They will also share their personal experiences and insights using a language lens on challenges and threats to digital rights.
The conversations will interrogate how threats to net neutrality marginalize digital content in African languages; the expansion of mis- and disinformation in African languages on various digital platforms and what companies or civil society are doing about it; the effects of a lack of affordable internet connectivity in places where there are large communities of speakers of an African language; the importance of and challenges for the right to access information in digital spaces in African languages.
They will also look at corporate policies, as well as ongoing challenges that may affect how citizens can freely express themselves in their language.
Meet the #IdentityMatrix Twitter Hosts
The Twitter conversations will be anchored by Denver Toroxa Breda (Khoekhoe/N|uu/English) from South Africa, Adéṣínà Ghani Ayẹni (Yorùbá/English) from Nigeria, Kpénahi Traoré (Bambara/French) from Burkina Faso, Roseblossom Ozurumba (Igbo/English) from Nigeria and Bonface Witaba (Swahili/English) from Kenya.

Protesters demand the removal of then-President Robert Mugabe (now deceased) from power on November 18, 2017.

In the early morning of November 15, 2017, Zimbabweans woke up to the news that former strongman, the late Robert Mugabe, had been deposed in a coup d'etat, and was under house arrest with his family at the presidential residence, State House.
Major General Sibusiso Moyo, now foreign affairs minister, announced on state television that the president was safe under state custody and that the situation has moved to another level.
Almost immediately following General Moyos announcement, Zimbabweans fervently took to social media in particular, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook to get updates on the situation.
This newfound popularity of social media to access information and mobilise protests took root for the first time among Zimbabweans, when protesters took to the streets and helped push Mugabe out of office.
The new government, led by Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, took notice of social medias power.
As a former state security minister, Mnangagwa also appreciated the importance and value of disinformation in Zimbabwes political terrain.
In a calculated move to consolidate newfound political power and ensure an electoral victory during the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for next year, Mnangagwa instructed his ruling ZANU PF (Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front) party youth league to enter the social media and online firmament and batter the opponent, back in March 2018.
In post-Mugabe Zimbabwe, this has exacerbated a mis- and disinformation crisis, leaving Zimbabweans with few credible and accurate sources of information to stay informed about the countrys transition and and anti-government protests.
While the new government decried fake news pertaining to any news circulated on social media that they perceived to threaten the countrys status quo, it also deployed tactics aimed at misleading the public about its handling of anti-government protests.
The bane of online free expression
Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant rise in mobile internet and social media usage over the past few years.
The internet penetration rate increased by 41.1 percent, from 11 percent of the population to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while mobile phone penetration increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 percent to 102.7 percent over the same period.
This means that half the population is now connected to the internet, compared to only 11 percent in 2010.
However, mis- and disinformation have found fertile ground to flourish owing to a variety of factors: extreme polarisation in the media, proposed government controls over social media, poor official communication methods and low digital literacy among internet users.
During the anti-government protests of January 2019, when state security forces arrested and beat hundreds of protesters, news of these clampdowns competed with government claims of fake news or their absolute denial.
The government restricted access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and contribute to widespread confusion.
They and their supporters also resorted to public misinformation about the protests and discredited any truthful information or reports as fake news.
In Zimbabwe, citizens usually regard general statements issued by government ministers as official policy.
For example, Deputy Information Minister Energy Mutodi sought to convince people that everything was normal and that videos and images of the military patrolling the streets were the work of a few rogue individuals.
Mutodi further misled the nation when he claimed on state television that there was no internet shutdown but rather a congested network.
In another suspected case of possible government-sanctioned disinformation, millions of people remained cut off from social media during the January protests.
Others downloaded Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications to stay informed, but messages circulated that downloading such applications would lead to arrests, creating further panic and apprehension.
When in March 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) tweeted a report denouncing the governments use of horrific violence during the January 2019 protests, government supporters took to Twitter to discredit and attack HRW.
One user tweeted that the organization is spreading blatant lies and described HRW as neo-colonial organization hired to malign innocent countries to push the US's hegemonic goals.
Another repeated government claims and blamed the violence on rogue elements who are trying [sic] destroy the image of the president.
And disinformation about government policies and other events of public interest have continued well beyond the January protests.
Most recently, ruling party ZANU PF members took to Twitter to misinform the public about the disappearance of Dr. Peter Magombey, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA).
He was abducted on September 14, 2019, following the announcement of a strike in the health sector.
The ZANU PF secretary for youth affairs described Magombey as a buffoon and an embarrassment to the profession.
An account under the name of ZANU PF Patriots said that his abduction was fake.
Others disseminated false claims that doctors killed many patients because of the strike, including more than 500 people in one hospital.
Zimbabwes historic conundrum
Media control in Zimbabwe bears its origins in colonial policies of the 20th century, which were tainted with violent subjugation to political authority.
The Ian Smith-led Rhodesian government valued propaganda and centralised information control as a weapon of choice, not only to endorse the regimes believed legitimacy but to spread disinformation about the war.
The colonial government passed a plethora of laws to suppress free expression or dissent against Smiths racist policies and they brutally enforced these laws to target liberation leaders.
Information blockades were the norm even before independence in 1980, and this set the government's tone in terms of communication policies and media management for years to come.
As renowned South African journalist and writer, the late Heidi Holland, wrote in her acclaimed biography, Dinner with Mugabe: The Untold Story of a Freedom Fighter Who Became a Tyrant:
So many in ZANU PF's hierarchy have lived with similar appalling violence woven into everyday life as if it were normal.
The bush war, or Second Chimurenga, has never really ended in Zimbabwe.
Today, Mnangagwa continues this legacy, suppressing voices of critics through online disinformation tactics and internet shutdowns.

In Uganda, the internet has become a battleground where the government attempts to silence a growing online population voicing dissent.
For years, Ugandan authorities have deployed different tactics to stifle political dissent and keep the ruling National Resistance Movement party and President Yoweri Museveni in power.
This includes blocking media websites, filtering SMS and shutting down social media platforms.
As Ugandas 2021 general election approaches, authorities are expected to continue deploying similar tactics.
2016 election shutdowns
During the 2016 general elections, Ugandan authorities resorted to shutting down entire social media platforms twice.
The first shutdown took place on February 18, 2016, on the eve of the presidential election, and it affected social media platforms and mobile money services.
The restrictions lasted for four full days.
On May 11, 2016, social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter and mobile money transfer services were once again blocked.
This shutdown lasted for one day and took place a day before President Museveni was sworn in for his fifth term as president.
Museveni has been in power since 1986.
Opposition to his rule is growing: According to a public opinion poll released in April 2019, an overall majority of Ugandans opposed a 2017 decision to remove the maximum age limit of 75 to run for president, which would allow the 74-year-old to run again in the 2021 elections.
During both shutdowns in 2016, the Ugandan government cited national security as the motivation behind restrictions.
The disruptions were ordered by Ugandas security agencies and the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), which regulates the telecommunications sector, online publications, broadcasting (both radio and television), film industry, postal and courier services.
On February 18, 2016, MTN Uganda, a telecommunications service provider, issued a statement on Twitter confirming that UCC, the regulator had directed MTN to disable all social media and mobile money services due to a threat to public order and safety.
This also affected other telecoms companies such as Airtel, Smile, Vodafone, and Africel.
The same day, President Museveni told journalists that he ordered the blocking of social media: Steps must be taken for security to stop so many getting in trouble, it is temporary because some people use those pathways for telling lies, he said.
On March 17, in an official declaration during Supreme Court deliberations in which President Musevenis 2016 victory was challenged, the UCC executive director Godfrey Mutabazi explained that he received instructions from the Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, to shut down social media networking sites and mobile money facilities owing to security concerns.
These shutdowns interfered with the rights and daily lives of Ugandans who use the internet and social media platforms to access information, express views and conduct everyday business online.
During the weeks prior to the 2016 elections, Ugandans actively tweeted and debated about the elections using hashtags like #UgandaDecides and #UGDebate16.
Ugandan citizens level of online civic engagement was sparked by the first-ever televised presidential debates, the first of which was held in January and the second, a week later.
Even with the social media bans in place, many Ugandans continued to post about the elections using Virtual Private Networks or VPNs.
On election day, citizens were able to share updates on late arrivals of voting materials at various stations, reports of election malpractice, and provisional election results on social media.
Human rights activists say that targeted shutdowns during election periods slow down communication, just when access to information and citizen expression are most needed.
Internet shutdowns limit people from communicating particular concerns that affect them, such as health, interaction with friends as well sharing of political views and opinions, Moses Owiny, the chief executive of the Center for Multilateral Affairs, an independent platform for policy analysis operating in Uganda and Tanzania, told Global Voices in an interview.
According to Owiny, shutdowns primarily aim to stop dissent in politics based on perceived fear by the state that citizens views and concerns are likely to incite the public, an accusation he believes is unfounded and not grounded in reality but assumptions.
Ugandas history of blocking platforms and websites
On April 14, 2011, the UCC instructed ISPs to temporarily block access to Facebook and Twitter for 24 hours to eliminate connecting and sharing information.
The order came in the heat of opposition-led walk to work protests over rising fuel and food prices.
The regulator stated that security agencies requested the block to minimize social media use in order to prevent violence.
In 2011, the elections were marked with SMS filtration that contained certain words including Egypt, bullet and people power.
In the lead up to the 2006 elections, the UCC instructed ISPs to block access to the website of Radio Katwe for publishing malicious and false information against the ruling National Resistance Movement and its presidential candidate, according to a 2015 ICT policy briefing by Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).
Ugandan authorities blocked access to the radio station and the Daily Monitor website for publishing independently tallied election results.
Media platforms were quickly reinstated but only after the electoral commission announced official results.
2021 elections: Same tactics?
President Museveni in May 2013.
He has been in power since 1986.

Robert Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, singer and leader of the opposition party People Power, who is also a member of parliament, has already announced his bid for the presidency.
Wine currently faces criminal charges for annoying the president and if convicted, he would not be allowed to run.
According to Human Rights Watch, in 2018 authorities targeted six opposition members including Bobi Wine and Francis Zaake, ahead of the August 15 by-elections in Arua (northern Uganda).
Members of the police and military arrested the group along with 28 other people on August 13, 2018, and charged them with treason.
They were later released on bail.
That same day, police also arrested two journalists, Herber Zziwa and Ronald Muwanga, as they covered the by-election and related violence, including the deadly shooting by the military of Bobi Wines driver.

As the 2021 election approaches, Uganda authorities are very likely to continue to crack down on political dissent, including through social media shutdowns.
In fact, since the 2016 elections, there has been no change in the legal framework that allows the government to restrict the rights to freedom of expression and access to information online.
According to the 2016 State of Internet Freedom in Africa report, the 2013 Communications Act gives UCC broad powers and functions under Section 5 that permits the communications regulator to monitor, inspect, license, supervise, control, and regulate communications services and to set standards, monitor, and enforce compliance relating to content.
At the request of the government, the UCC used this section to order ISPs to block access to social media and mobile money services during the 2016 elections.
The government continues to weaponize these laws to control public debate and to silence political dissent, particularly at times of elections.
Owiny argues that the state is capable of shutting down the internet at any time deemed necessary: Where regime security and that of its citizens converges, and where regime security is threatened, the regime security and its survival will take precedent.
Nongovernmental organizations and human rights defenders have been organizing in Uganda so that shutdowns like the ones that took place in 2016 dont happen again.
Several organizations wrote a joint letter to the African Union and regional bodies asking them to condemn the decision by Ugandan authorities to shut down internet access during the 2016 elections.
Unwanted Witness Uganda took the Ugandan state to court, along with internet service providers and the regulator, in a case filed in September 2016.
The organization contended that the internet shutdown planned by the state violated the rights of Ugandans to personal freedom of speech and expression is enshrined in Article 29(1) of the 1995 constitution.
However, a judge ruled that the applicants failed to prove any violations that resulted from the shutdowns, Unwanted Witness Uganda told Global Voices.
Achieving uninterrupted access to the internet particularly during the upcoming elections will require more advocacy.
Owiny suggested the need for digital rights activists to deepen conversations between the government and private sector to present the negative impact of shutdowns because the private sector is intimidated by the state.
Uganda was among the first African countries to enact a right to information law, known as the Access to Information Act (ATIA), in 2005.
The law promises to provide efficient, effective, transparent and accountable that will enable the public to effectively access and participate in decisions that affect them as citizens of the country.
Will the government meet its mandate to promote the right to access to information?
Will it live up to its promise?

Since 2002, the school has promoted and preserved the Zanzibar's unique mix of Arab, Indian and African cultures through music.
After 17 years, the school faces a financial crisis that threatens its closure.
Nearly 70% of its 80 full-time students can't afford to pay their tuition, which comes to about $13 USD per month, according to an official DCMA press release.
While the school has received support over the years from international donors and diplomatic missions, they face a gap in funding that may force them to shut their doors at the historic Old Customs House.
Without crucial funds to continue, DCMA students and staff fear that the soulful sounds that flow through the hallways of this iconic institution that make these islands sing may cease.
The school not only teaches and promotes traditional culture and heritage through music, but it's also home to a community of young musicians who seek alternatives to making a living as creatives.

We [have started] to face a very challenging financial moment, said Alessia Lombardo, managing director of the DCMA, in an official DCMA video.
From now to the next six months, we are not sure that we can guarantee the salaries to our teachers and staff.
At the moment, 19 master teachers and small core staff have gone without salaries for over three months as the school struggles to secure strong funding partnerships and explore sustainable funding models for a school.
While the archipelago is known as a tourist destination for its pristine beaches and luxury hotels, the majority of local people struggle with high unemployment even as poverty has slightly decreased, according to The World Bank.
For 17 years, the DCMA has worked tirelessly to promote and protect Zanzibars rich heritage and traditions through music.

Kidude, Zanzibar is home to musical genres that emerged through cultural exchange and collaboration along the Swahili Coast for hundreds of years.
Today, students can learn traditional musical genres like taarab, ngoma and kidumbak, along with instruments like drums, qanun and oud, as gatekeepers and interpreters of culture and tradition.

I know many young people who would like to study music but they cant afford the minimal tuition fee because they are poor and unemployed, Surri said in the DCMA video.

After completing DCMA workshops, certificate and diploma courses, many DCMA students go on to perform on world stages as award-winning bands and solo artists.
Zanzibars Amina Omar Juma, a former DCMA student and current DCMA teacher, recently returned from a tour in South Africa with her critically acclaimed, Siti and the Band, known for fusing the roots by blending traditional taarab sounds with contemporary, layered rhythms.
She and other band members, also former DCMA students, released their first full album, Fusing the Roots, in 2018, going on to perform at Sauti za Busara, East Africa's largest music festival, that same year.
Here's Siti and the Band's Nielewe (Understand Me) and music video, depicting scenes from Zanzibar while telling the story of a woman who experiences domestic abuse and dreams of life in music, much like Omar Juma's personal story:

A history of cultural crossroads and collaboration
Over 15,000 visitors have passed through the academys iconic building to enjoy live performances, workshops and classes and interact with passionate DCMA musicians who represent the future of Zanzibar culture and heritage, according to the DCMA.
Drawing from a complex history of Indian, Arab and African exchange, the school celebrates the influence of dhow countries, with inspiration from cultures that converged along the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.
The Omani Sultanate, a major maritime force from the 17th to 19th centuries, shifted its seat of power from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1840.
From Stone Town, Omani kings oversaw elaborate systems of maritime trade, including cloves, gold, and textiles, powered by strong winds that set dhows traditional Arab vessels sailing across the Indian Ocean, from India to Oman to East Africa.
Young Zanzibaris recognize the importance of connecting with the past to determine their future and the music created today expresses that desire to bridge the old with the new.
DCMA students and teachers recently formed TaraJazz, a blend of traditional taarab and modern jazz.
Their violinist, Felician Mussa, 20, has only been studying the violin for 3.5 years; TaraJazz is one of the most sought-after bands on the islands, captured here by photographer Aline Coquelle:
The Swahili coast tells the story of epic cultural exchanges and the DCMA continues this tradition through its musical collaborations.
Every year, the school hosts an initiative called Swahili Encounters, matching well-known musicians hailing from Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America with DCMA students to create original musical compositions within a week-long period.
At the end of the encounter, the newly-formed collaboration performs at Sauti za Busara, and many of these collaborations turn into life-time friendships that transcend the boundaries of language and culture, proving music is a universal language.

The DCMA recognizes that music empowers and unites people across cultures and it also employs talented youth living in a struggling economy with limited job opportunities.
For the 1,800 students who have trained at the DCMA, this is the only musical home they know, where they can learn and grow as professional musicians and artists.
One traveler from Spain, who recently visited the DCMA, wrote on TripAdvisor: Personally, meeting the musicians was the best piece of my time on this island.
As Zanzibars tourism sector rapidly grows, the DCMA believes that music plays an essential role in the celebration, preservation and promotion of Swahili culture, heritage and history.
Zanzibar is far more than its beaches and luxury hotels its a place bursting with talent that stems from an extraordinary history of cultural connection and collaboration.

Sierra Leone: Health workers prepare to enter an area where Ebola patients get treatment.

On August 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a positive development in the clinical trials of drugs being tested for the treatment of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR of Congo).
WHO asserted that the Ebola drugs showed advances that will bring patients a better chance of survival, and further affirmed that two out of the four drugs being tested are more effective in treating Ebola.
Who is the man behind the Ebola cure?
Esteemed professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director-general of the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) DR of Congo, who invested a substantial part of his adult life treating the virus.
While the international media has often focused heavily on the deadly, contagious nature of Ebola in DR of Congo, less has been said about the Congolese scientist who discovered its cure.
Muyembe-Tamfum declared: We will no longer say that EVD [Ebola virus disease] is not curable.
Based on Muyembe-Tamfum's tireless work, scientists tested four drugs for Ebola treatment: ZMapp, remdesivir, mAb114 and REGN-EB3.
The results from the clinical trials conducted in 499 study participants showed that patients treated with REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival when compared to those treated with the two other drugs.
The trials were conducted under the auspices of the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), the DR Congo Ministry of Health and three medical humanitarian organizations: the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), the International Medical Corps (IMC) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
The Congolese scientist behind the Ebola treatment
Muyembe-Tamfum has been researching Ebola since its first known outbreak in DR of Congo in 1976 when he became the first researcher to travel to the area of the first outbreak.
Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in the Democratic Republic of #Congo and his team have discovered a new Ebola treatment that can cure symptoms in just an hour
A professor of microbiology at Kinshasa University Medical School in DR of Congo, he has been working for the past 40 years on a cure for the disease.
In 1995, he worked with WHO in implementing detection protocols and control measures in the first documented urban outbreak of Ebola in Kikwit, DR of Congo.

With this discovery, people infected with Ebola will now have more trust in the possibility of recovery and will be more likely to go to the hospital for treatment.
Now that 90 percent of their patients can go into the treatment center and come out completely cured, they will start believing it and building trust in the population and community.
Jean-Jacque Muyembe-Tamfum
Why Ebola treatment matters
The first recorded cases of Ebola occurred in 1976 near the Ebola River in DR of Congo.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since then, the Ebola virus has emerged periodically from its natural reservoir (which remains unknown) to infect people in Africa.
Ebola virus outbreaks since 1976.
Map from the Centres of Disease Prevention and Control
Between 2014 and 2016 there were more than 28,600 recorded cases of Ebola within West Africa.
According to a WHO 2015 report:
In October 2014, Senegal had one case of Ebola infection and zero death.
WHO declared Nigeria's curtailment of the virus as a piece of world-class epidemiological detective work.
In January 2015, Mali had 8 reported cases and 6 deaths.
However, the most devastating cases occurred between March and June 2016 in three countries: Sierra Leone: over 14,000 cases and about 4,000 deaths; Liberia: about 10,000 cases and 3,000 deaths; Guinea: 3,800 cases and 2,500 deaths.
The global narrative on Ebola
Ebola's ravaging of African countries generated global panic and hysteria in 2015 when two patients died in the United States and one each in Spain and Germany.
GabyFleur Böl, a researcher at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany, identified other cases in Spain, Germany, the UK, Italy and Switzerland.
At that time, an Ebola infection was considered a death sentence due to the lack of an effective treatment.
As Böl asserted, the high mortality rate of Ebola and also the sometimesexaggerated media coverage of the epidemic created hysteria around the world.
This position was further corroborated by a 2017 study in which Hal Roberts, Brittany Seymour, Sands Alden Fish II, Emily Robinson and Ethan Zuckerman analyzed over 109,000 stories published in US mainstream/regional media and blogs between July to November 2014, with a focus on Ebola coverage.
They discovered that three distinct peaks in Ebola coverage in the United States media and blogs occurred around July 27, September 28, and 15 October 2014:
On July 27, reports broke of the first infections of American doctors in Liberia.
On September 30, media widely reported the infection of Thomas Duncan in Texas as the first infection on US soil.
On October 12, Ebola coverage intensified with the first infection of a health care worker in the United States.
After October 12, a series of other US infection-related events led to continuous coverage that gradually lessened in intensity over time.
US media may have covered Ebola so intensively because of the presence of the disease in the US.
In addition, with a more interconnected army of digital networks, the Ebola epidemic became more amplified in Europe and the US.
However, what remains to be seen is if the discovery of a cure by an African from DR of Congo to this African epidemic will also garner as much coverage as it did in 2017.

On July 29, six plainclothes policemen forcefully removed journalist Erick Kabendera from his home in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and took him into police custody.
Police say Kabendera had failed to obey a summons to investigate the status of his Tanzanian citizenship.
Over the last week, police searched Kabenderas home twice, confiscated his passport and other personal documents and interrogated his family.
By August 5, authorities switched track, charging Kabendera with money laundering, tax evasion in the amount of $75,000 United States dollars, and criminal racketeering, according to a copy of the charge sheet obtained by the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Police say Kabendera committed these crimes over a four-year period beginning in 2015.
With these charges, Kabendera may face up to 15 years in prison and can not seek bail.
Tanzania's Magufuli
First they abduct a journalist, when there is an outcry they claim he is not Tanzanian, when that doesn't stick, he is charged with organised crime and tax evasion.
People, meet Erick Kabendera, his crime is journalism.
Press freedom has drastically deteriorated in Magufuli's Tanzania, CPJ reports.
CPJ sub-Saharan Africa Representative Muthoki Mumo says:
It seems that for the past week, authorities have been searching for a way to justify their detention of this critical freelance journalist.
First, they claimed Erick Kabenderas citizenship was in question, today they have leveled drastically different charges, which call into question their motive for holding him.
As a journalist, Kabendera has been critical of President John Magufulis administration and often speaks out in favor of press freedom.
He has reported on Tanzanias divisive politics for international and local media such as The Guardian, African Arguments and The East African.
Jebra Kambole, Kabenderas lawyer, says authorities also accused Kabendera of sedition for allegedly publishing an article titled John Magufuli is bulldozing Tanzanias freedom, in The Economist, but this charge was later dropped.
Just in: Tanzanian Journalist Erick Kabendera to be charged with sedition over an article published in the Economist titled John Magufuli is bulldozing Tanzanias Freedom.Statement from Jebra Kambole states that Mr Kabendera has been denied bail.
Citizenship targeted as tool for repression
Kabenderas family says this is not the first time the Tanzanian government has questioned Kabenderas citizenship.
In 2013, authorities lobbed a similar charge against him but the case was later dismissed, according to The Citizen.
Kabendera felt at the time that authorities called his citizenship into question as a way to silence him.
Last year, The Citizen also reported on several other cases where the government used the citizenship question as a tool to silence critics in Tanzania.
Aidan Eyakuze, executive director of Twaweza, a civil society organization focused on citizen voices, says authorities confiscated his passport and banned him from travel while investigating Eyakuzes citizenship status.
Two weeks prior, Twaweza had issued and released results from a survey called Speaking truth to power?
Citizens views on politics in Tanzania.
The Commission for Science and Technology (Costech) claimed the survey was unauthorized and threatened legal action but later dismissed the case, according to the same Citizen article.
Tanzania has in recent years introduced a series of amendments and laws that target bloggers and media, civil society organizations, arts and cultural organizations and academics and researchers in what is by critical observers perceived as attempts to control Tanzania's narrative and stifle free speech and political dissent.

#FreeErickKabendera
Hundreds of journalists, human rights advocates and concerned leaders and citizens flooded social media in support of Kabendera:
AFEX Africa calls the charges a blatant act of violation:
It's been nine days and Tanzanian police are still holding investigative journalist, Erick Kabendera in custody.
@AFEXafrica calls for an end to this blatant act of violation: https://t.co/7UFZkzYzwV @MRA_Nigeria @FXISouthAfrica @gmpressunion #FreeErickKabendera #NoImpunity
AFEX (@AFEXafrica) August 6, 2019
Kabendera, who often mentors aspiring journalists, inspired this tweet from a former student:
I have met Erick Kabendera once in my life, and for a little less than 80 minutes.
He came as a guest Tutor to my class (School of Journalism and Mass Communication- @UniofDar).
Despite the brief time he spent with us, I learned a lot from him.
He truly inspired me!
#100K4Erick
Another netizen notes that Kabendera's arrest and trumped-up charges signal a warning to other citizens:
I don't defend Kabendera because he's a Tanzanian or because he's a journalist.I defend him because I live in Tanzania where Erick lives.
If rights are not granted to him today, and I stay silent, it's possible that tomorrow, rights will be denied to me also.
No one is safe when Injustice reigns.
I and we are (all) Ivan Golunov.

: this Russian expression meaning boiling pointthe point when enough has become enoughis perhaps the best way to convey how an increasing number of Russians feel about the arrest of Ivan Golunov.
Golunov, a leading investigative journalist, was detained on June 6 in Moscow on what appear to be trumped-up charges of drug dealing and possession.
Golunov was arrested and initially denied access to a lawyer, in violation of Russian law.
His lawyer confirmed he sustained serious injuries while in custody.
After being taken to hospital, he was discharged and placed under house arrest on June 8.
The Russian police initially produced photos of a drug lab allegedly found when they searched in Golunovs flat, but the images were later retracted.
The pro-Kremlin media outlet Russia Today also confirmed that the pictures were not taken in Golunovs flat.
The charges being leveled against Golunov could lead to a 10 to 20-year prison sentence.
Thirty-six-year-old Golunov works for Meduza, one of the few remaining independent Russian-language online media platforms.
Meduza is registered in neighboring Latvia, but maintains an office and several journalists in Moscow.
Golunov has led and published several investigations pointing at cases of corruption involving high-ranking officials.
Since Golunovs arrest, Meduza has released Golunovs articles under a Creative Commons license and has encouraged media outlets and individuals to republish the stories, an initiative fully supported by Global Voices.
Among his most important reports are ones detailing how Moscows deputy mayor Pyotr Biryukov channeled state contracts to his family, and how Moscow's urban beautification program involved inflated budgets.
The story he was working on just before his detention focused on the monopoly of funeral services in Moscow.
Golunov's arrest has sparked a rare expression of solidarity among not only journalists, activists and lawyers, but also actors, popular singers, and figures from outside the liberal circles of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
On June 10, three leading newspapers agreed to publish editions with identical front pages in support of Golunov.
The newspapers were sold out in record time.
In a rather ironic u-turn, pro-Kremlin media, including Channel One, Russias most-viewed TV channel, are also calling for a fair investigation.
June 12 marks Russia Day, when public marches and demonstrations approved by local authorities will take place.
Under Russian law, public demonstrations require a permit.
Golunovs supporters have announced they will hold their own march without obtaining official permission.
Kremlin observers say the Russian government is seeking to lift the charges against the journalist before June 20.
On that day, President Vladimir Putin, whose ratings have fallen to a historical low in the country, will host the Direct Line, his annual talk show where he takes questions from citizens by telephone and online media.

Its been a little over 24 hours since Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina left this world, but his presence and impact continues to reverberate around the globe.
The outspoken, openly gay writer rebuked convention and challenged the status quo, triggering a literary revolution that would open the door to thousands of aspiring writers ready to change the narratives in and about Africa.
The writer, educator and LGBTQ activist, Binyavanga Wainaina, 48, passed on Tuesday, May 22, in Nairobi, Kenya, after a brief illness.
Today's got me thinking: what will your life mean when it's all over?
Binyavanga's death has got me thinking about who I was about five or so years ago, and also who he was to us as young enthusiastic Africans hungry for a different paradigm of our continent and our selves.
Fungai Machirori (@fungaijustbeing) May 22, 2019
Within minutes, Wainainas friends, followers and admirers flooded social media to swap tributes and memories while arguing which of his prolific writings had the most influence.
Wainaina is best known for his provocative essay, How to Write About Africa, published in Granta magazine in 2006.
He's also known for his 2012 memoir, One Day I Will Write About This Place, and the essay, I am a homosexual, mum, published simultaneously in Chimurenga and Africa is a Country in 2014.
The essay caused a powerful stir on Twitter as people tried to parse fact from fiction, and subsequently, Time magazine named Wainaina one of the top 100 most influential people in the world.
In How to Write About Africa, Wainaina called out Western media and the aid industry both particularly present in Nairobi for perpetuating negative stereotypes about the continent of Africa, through scathing satire.
Never have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel Prize.
An AK-47, prominent ribs, naked breasts: use these.
If you must include an African, make sure you get one in Masai or Zulu or Dogon dress.
His sarcasm was dripping a stellar scalpel, writes Nigerian writer Nwachukwu Egbunike.
Widely cited by academics, non-governmental organizations and aid workers, the essay also published as a small booklet has had a profound impact on perceptions of Africa and continues to circulate, surprise and provoke.
On its impact, journalist Pernille Bærendtsen writes:
For me, this essay has followed me since I received it as a gift in 2008 by a Kenyan friend.
I clearly belonged to the group of people Binyavanga addressed: A development worker employed by a Danish NGO in Tanzania writing about its impact.
This was at a point when the development and aid industry sharpened its rhetoric in favor of fundraising at the cost of unfolding the contrasting diversity on the ground.
I had plenty of reason to feel embarrassed, but I also had time to plan how to change.
Binyavanga later explained in the journal Bidoun how this essay randomly came to life with double-effect: By exposing and describing the insecurity of novelists, NGO workers, rock musicians, conservationists, students, and travel writers, who read these guidelines on how or maybe rather how not to write about Africa, they then began to ask for his approval.
Wainaina, a son of a Kenyan father and Ugandan mother, continued to challenge stereotypes about Africa with his groundbreaking 2012 memoir, One Day I Will Write About This Place.
Through rich, searing detail, he transported readers from his childhood in the 70s in Kenya to his student days in South Africa, where he spent many years in exile.
Critics hailed the book as raw and honest, but Wainaina later admitted that hed left out an important chapter his love life.
With I am a homosexual, mum, Wainaina became the first high-profile Kenyan to come out as openly gay on social media, triggering an avalanche of social opinion.
Considered the lost chapter from his memoir.
Wainaina imagines coming out as gay to his dying mother.
His essay was timely as a wave of anti-gay crusades and legislation were being proposed in Uganda and later Tanzania, where homosexual acts remain criminalized.

However, unlike other writers who went into exile, Wainaina returned home, and as Nanjala Nyabola points out for BBC on Twitter, that was major:
For those of us who grew up with "the best Kenyan writers" (whatever that means) living in exile, jailed and persecuted, or poor and under appreciated, or censored heavily, he came back and that was major.
He was a complex man, but I think for this he deserves endless gratitude.
We must free our imaginations
While Binyavanga ironically attracted admiration from the diverse international crowd he criticized, at home he felt the pressure of not fitting the set frames.
Binyavanga demanded free space and imagination.
Courageously within a growing community supportive of LGBTQ he insisted on bending those frames.
In response to all the noise and pushback, that same year Wainaina produced We Must Free Our Imaginations, a six-part Youtube series detailing his ideas on freedom and the imagination.
I want to live a life of a free imagination, he declared in Part 1.
I want this generation of young parents to have their kids see Africans writing their own stories that simple act is the most political act one can have.
I want to see a continent where every kind of persons imagination does not have to look for being allowed.
I am a Pan-Africanist, I want to see this continent change.
Wainaina often channeled his desire for change through his literary activism, education and leadership.
In 2002, after winning the prestigious Caine Prize for his essay, Discovering Home, he used the award money to co-found Kwani?
a literary magazine promoting new voices and new ideas emerging from across the continent.
Kwani?
evolved over time into a publishing house and literary network that connected emerging and established writers from Lagos to Nairobi, Mogadishu to Accra.

While he unapologetically shook Kenyan social convention coming out as gay, and later revealing his HIV+ status on Twitter on World AIDS Day in 2016 it often came with backlash, struggle and pain.
Wainaina was a controversial person who struggled with depression and often wrestled with his complicated role as a public figure.
He had his fans but he also faced critics like prominent Kenyan writer Shailja Patel, who accused Wainaina of toxic lesbophobia.
Twitter user Néo Músangi grapples with the fallibility of Wainaina's character in this tweet:
i do not have sufficient energy to engage now but, i am grieving binya, as the dearest of my friends in all my queerness and feminist-ing.
I am eternally sorry that he hurt others.
I am sorry that he human-ed in those ways.
He would hate us sanitising him.
Writer Bwesigye Mwsigire, director of the Writivism Festival in Uganda, also addressed these contradictions in a Facebook tribute:
His style was a transgression.
Beautiful and freeing transgression.
[T]he people we obsess over because of their work and ideas are people after all.
They are human.
Are we ever ready to love them in their complexity?
By now, a lot has been said about him.
There's no need to repeat what has been said.
Reminders of harm that he supported have been sounded.
This doesn't take away the pain one feels about his death.
There is only one Binyavanga Wainaina.
He is an ancestor now.
Let us celebrate his life.
A creative genius
Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi wrote on Twitter that after writing a Facebook tribute to Wainaina, hateful, homophobic comments derailed his message:
Wainaina was a creative genius who must be remembered:
I did a very short Facebook post on #RIPBinyavanga and the comments https://t.co/yZ3MoWBnD7 are the vilest l have ever read.
Even the thieves who steal our taxes and kill people don't get as much hate.
Truth is, Binya was a creative genius and he will be read and be remembered.
Ugandan feminist and writer Rosebell Kagumire distills the lessons she learned from Wainainas courage to speak out:
Do not allow the fear.
Don't limit yourself.
Do speak that which needs to be said.
Better yet write it down.
Live your truth and with your heart.
That when you finally finally breathe your last there will be millions of words you brought so much meaning into.#RIPBinyavanga
Through his life and letters, he gave himself and countless others the permission to imagine life as it could be otherwise, and his sudden passing inspired poetic musings:
One day I will write about your gorgeous hair
One day I will write about your laughter
One day I will write about your ungovernability
One day I will write about your delight in imagination
One day I will write about your refusals
Today, I write thank you
Kenyan writer Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, author of Dust, and literary friend to Wainaina, calls out with a final lament:
Who told you could leave?
Sneak out of your body at night without leaving a new address?
Face tilted, eyes piercing, he said, "You have exactly 3 seconds to reorganise this crap."
You, there. You! Who told you you could leave?
Sneak out of your body at night without leaving a new address?
To whom does one now go in fear and trembling with first draft manuscripts?
Now that he's among the stars, you can join Planet Binya with a full archive of his work.
Front page of newspaper Jornal de Angola on the tender won by the company Telstar.
Taken by Dércio Tsandzana, 19 April 2019 and used with permission
The Angolan president João Lourenço cancelled, on 18 Abril, the public tender for the fourth mobile phone operator in the country, arguing that the winner Telstar did not meet the necessary requirements to deliver the service.
The presidents decision could indicate divisions in the Angolan government.
The company Telstar was created in January 2018 with a capital stock of 200,000 Kwanza (around 600 US dollars), and its shareholders are the general Manuel João Carneiro (90 per cent) and the businessman António Cardoso Mateus (10 per cent), according to the Portuguese newspaper Observador.
Manuel João Carneiros rank was awarded by the previous president José Eduardo dos Santos, according to the Angolan online news outlet Club Net.
The Observador reported that 27 companies participated in the tendering process opened by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology, under José Carvalho da Rocha.
On 25 April, João Lourenço signed an order which establishes new rules for opening the new invitation to tender, according to the newspaper Jornal de Angola.
After the results of the first tender were made public, many Angolans questioned the integrity of the process.
Some, for example, highlighted that winner Telstar did not even have a website.
Skit Van Darken, an editor and event organizer, said on Facebook:
Telstar Telecommunications, Ltd, formed on 26 January 2018, with capital of 200,000 Kwanzas according to the [newspaper] Diário da República, whose shareholders are the general Manuel João Carneiro (90 per cent of the capital), in retirement, and António Cardoso Mateus (10 per cent).
The majority shareholder has links to the company Mundo Startel, a limited liability company, registered at INACOM, the telecommunications regulator, with a landline licence, although expired.
A company that doesnt even have a website!
I DONT EVEN BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE OTHER COMPETITORS
THIS COUNTRY IS A DISGRACE
Meanwhile, Joaquim Lunda, a journalist and frequent social media commentator, praised the presidents action and even thought that the minister in question ran the risk of being fired for these failings:
I appreciate, and it is praiseworthy, the decision taken by the president of the republic, João Lourenço, to annul the public tender which awarded the Angolan company Telstar the licence for the fourth telecommunications operator in Angola.
There were many reservations and a lot of points to clarify around the issue.
One doesnt see the aptitude in a company which was created in 2018 with capital stock of 200 thousand kwanzas to be awarded such an undertaking.
I am completely certain that the days of the Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology, José Carvalho de Rocha, are numbered.
After the failure of ANGOSAT 1, now also this that we witness today, I doubt if Dread will make it.
Lets enjoy the show calmly!!
The presidents decision came after the same minister led the project, in 2017, for the satellite Angosat 1, also characterized by problems.
For Adriano Sapiñala, a deputy of Angolas biggest opposition party, the case shows disorganization within the government:
JLo [João Lourenço] has to organize his team well because yesterday the minister responsible was saying that the time for complaints had ended and so Telstar would have gone ahead with its next steps given that it was the winner of the fraudulent tender and today JLo comes and annuls the tender!!
You communicate so badly?
Now either the minister makes his position available (resigning) or then JLo has to fire him because if he cancelled the tender it is because it did not go well and to not affect anybody innocent, they need to establish responsibility!!

This story was written by Tamás B. Kovács and translated by Anita Kőműves for the Hungarian investigative journalism non-profit, Atlatszo.
This edited version appears here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.
Hungarian pro-government media outlets have launched new attacks against Blanka Nagy, a high school student who has spoken out against the government at several protests since late 2018.
Nagy has endured criticism of her intellect and even sexual harassment, with one outlet calling her a whore.
She has already filed and won defamation cases against three pro-government outlets that claimed she was failing in school: Lokál, Ripost, and Origo.
However, after Nady won her case against Origo, the outlet launched another attack, publishing her school reports.
Nagy told Atlatszo that she is considering suing Origo again over these latest stories.
Blanka Nagy became well-known in Hungary last winter after she gave a speech at an anti-government rally, in which she criticized prominent politicians using foul language.
Her harsh words resonated with many social media users and a video of her speech went viral.
About two months after her video became a social media sensation, the pro-government media and pundits such as Zsolt Bayer launched a series of attacks against her.
Pro-government outlets claimed that she was failing many of her subjects in school and that she had missed many days of school.
They also called her an untalented wannabe actress and a whore.
Her attorney filed copies of her academic transcript with the court to prove that she is not failing her classes and thus the school transcripts became available for attorneys of Origo.
The outlet decided to publish data from her transcripts, claiming that Nagy almost failed history last term and is on the verge of failing in a few other subjects as well.
When #Hungarys pro-govt media lied about teenage protester Blanka Nagy, she sued for defamation and won.
Ordered to issue corrections, however, they've refused and doubled down.

My attorney and I are considering suing the outlet that published my school transcript, Nagy told Atlatszo in an interview.
She says that Origo had no right to publish the transcripts.
She and her attorney did not even think that Origo had the right to see the transcripts when they filed them in court.
And their latest claims are not true either, she said.
I am not failing my history class, contrary to what they say.
I have a much better grade than a 2 (rough equivalent to a C-).
What they say is simply false.
I would be ashamed if it was true because I have a history teacher among my ancestors, she said.
I think all this verbal aggression against me is very strange but I am no longer bothered by it.
It only proves that I somehow scared the highest ranks of governing party Fidesz.
The fact that Zsolt Bayer himself attacked me and the pro-government media is using false pretexts to try and smear me proves that, she added.
Blanka Nagy high schooler: Fidesz is a disgusting, treacherous, ugly & infectious plague.
This disgusting band of thieves,this oligarch-government are filling their pockets for their old days, while you will suffer in poverty as a pensioner.
She told the truth.
THIS is Hungary.
Defamation and disinformation are common weapons of Hungarian pro-government media.
Some opposition figures have responded by suing these outlets for character assassination.
According to data recently obtained by Atlatszo, the most prominent propaganda outlets have lost dozens of cases, and were mandated by the courts to issue corrections to their stories 109 times during 2018.

Since mass protests against president Daniel Ortega erupted in Nicaragua in April 2018, the government has banned demonstrations, arrested thousands without trial, and shut down both alternative and mainstream media outlets.
As attempts at dialogue have so far failed, the future of Nicaragua remains an open question.
The demonstrations were originally against a social security reform that would raise income taxes while reducing pension benefits.
The initial crackdown by the authorities paved the way for a nationwide call for the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and first lady and Vice-President Rosario Murillo.
Figures given for the protests death toll vary, and have not been updated since last year as barriers to documentation efforts increase.
In December 2018 the government closed down several NGOs that were keeping track of police violence and human rights abuses, including the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (Cenidh) and the Institute for the Development of Democracy (Ipade).
Also in December, two groups set up by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR)the Special Follow-up Mechanism for Nicaragua (MESENI) and the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Expertswere expelled from the country, leaving Nicaragua virtually without independent human rights observers and opening a new stage in the repression, according to Nicaraguan feminist activist and educator María Teresa Blandón.

The lowest estimate of the casualties, acknowledged by the government in August 2018, amounted to 197.
Amnesty International, however, has estimated that there have been 322 deaths as of 18 September 2018, most of them caused by gunshots to the head, neck, and torso.
Blogger Ana Siú wrote recently on Medium about her experience of the April 2018 protests:
I saw a friend from University being attacked by a mob through Instagram Live.
I heard her scream and struggle to avoid being hurt [] Finally, the man in the motorcycle [that had attacked her] let her go, but he took her phone.
He didn't realize he was still live.
Then he said Let's go!
We have to take these phones to be checked.
This went on for 20 minutes.
She also reflects on the protest of May 30, a historic rally held on the date Nicaragua celebrates Mother's Day where 15 people were killed:
That day the way we saw the protests change.
Those of us who were in that massive protest saw how they killed young people.
It was the first time they had attacked a mass protest with bullets.
I had never felt so close to death.
While students barricaded themselves in universities in the capital Managua, rural workers blocked roads in the countryside.
In June, protesters in Masaya declared the eastern city a dictatorship-free territory.
The government cracked down on these protesters, who built in barricades to defend themselves and respond to police attacks.
Demonstrators increasingly engaged in more violent methods and confrontations, which resulted in the death of 22 police officers as of August 2018, according to government data.
In mid-2018, the police deployed the so-called operación limpieza (clean-up operation) to dismantle barricades and prosecute suspected participants.
Reports say that law enforcement acted in cooperation with paramilitary groups.
Many students, leaders of peasant movements, rights defenders and journalists were targeted in smear campaigns and persecuted, and some were charged with terrorism.
Even health professionals who treated people injured in the riots suffered consequences.
The Nicaraguan Medical Association said at least 240 such professionals were fired from public hospitals and clinics in retaliation.

In September, protests were made essentially illegal, as all street activities now require advance permission from the authorities, which is often denied.
On February 27, 2019, dialogue was resumed between the government and the opposition party, Alianza Cívica por la Justicia y la Democracia (Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy), following the release of a hundred people from prison.
Unlike previous attempts at dialogue, however, this one did not include leaders of peasant movements and students, as some of them are incarcerated, and others are in exile.
Not just a new president a new beginning
As the country's crisis enters its second year, the urgency and anxiety about Nicaragua's future is conveyed through the hashtag #SOSNicaragua, which is deployed daily in conjunction with allegations, pictures of victims and accounts of students in prison and their families.

Nicaraguan news outlet Niú interviewed Nicaraguans who held a protest in February in neighboring Costa Rica, and they shared accounts of the difficulties of life in exile.
Alejandro Donaire, a student who says he fled the country after participating in a peaceful protest, told Niú how difficult it was to feel part of a functioning society in a normal life, after spending so much time hiding, fleeing or protesting.
Madelaine Caracas, spokesperson of the student group known as the Student Coordination for Democracy, also shared with Niú her aspirations for transformation in Nicaragua, which go beyond Ortega's departure:
[We need to] eradicate authoritarianism, sexism, personal autocracy and other ills that have penetrated the political culture of the country.
We believe more than ever that Ortega will leave this year [] that I will return to Nicaragua this year.
And I have the certainty because Ortega is out of air internationally and economically; and also because those who participated in the uprising last April are now more organized than ever.
This last round of dialogues between government and opposition came to an end on April 3, with agreements reached on two of the four topics discussed.
The government has pledged, firstly, to release all political prisoners and, secondly, to respect civil liberties.
There were no agreements made regarding justice for the victims of violence or the expediting of the 2021 elections.
Opposition group Civic Alliance pointed out, however, that the government has so far failed to honor the agreements.
Police repression of peaceful protests has reportedly continued.
As of April 6, only 50 out of over 600 political prisoners had been released, and those that were were placed under house arrest.
Later, on April 17, following new threats of sanctions from the United States, over 600 prisoners were released to complete their sentences under house arrest, though but according to Civic Alliance, only 18 members of the group were on the list of political prisoners they had hoped to see out of jail.
In the minds of people like activist and researcher Felix Madariaga, the new leaders of Nicaragua's future remain in prison today.
Meanwhile, opposition groups are calling for protests commemorating the anniversary of the events of April 2018.
With the refusal of authorities to grant permission to the demonstration, new police crackdowns are anticipated.
