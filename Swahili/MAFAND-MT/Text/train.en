Angola and Brazil have a special relationship towards each other, partially because of their common language and their shared colonial past - both countries were part of the Portuguese Empire - and the cultural ties that stem from this shared history.
Since 2000, commerce between the two countries has started to grow and it is now booming.
According to the Association of Brazilian Companies in Angola (AEBRAN), trade between the two countries has risen six-fold since 2002.
With the increase in trade, the presence of Brazilian companies in Angola has also grown.
Consequently, immigration from Brazil to Angola has increased too, 70 percent over the last five years.
There are an estimated 5,000 Brazilians registered in Angola, mainly working for construction, mining and agribusiness companies.
This new development in Angolan history, a country which was more accustomed to immigration to the other side of the Atlantic, leads to an unavoidable culture shock for both Brazilians and Angolans alike.
Below are two entire blog posts showing different perspectives of one people towards the other, raising issues of immigration, racism, ethnicity and mutual respect.
Above all, they illustrate the complex and diverse relationship - with all of the inevitable similarities and differences - of siblings growing up an ocean apart.

Migas , a Brazilian living in Luanda, says the following:
The Negro was uprooted from his land and sold as merchandise, enslaved.
In Brazil he arrived as slave, object; from his land he departed as a free man.
During the journey, the slave traffic, he lost his personality, but his culture, his history, his landscape, his experiences; they came with him.
300-year history of Negro enslavement in Brazil has made an impact on this country.
Candomblé is one such impact, a religion filled with many secrets, symbols and rituals known only to initiates but it is also a vital part of cultural expression in Brazil.
There are no definitive numbers on how many people in Brazil follow Candomblé.
The government estimates, conservatively, that there are more than 300,000 centers of worship for Brazil's Afro-Brazilian religions, which include Candomblé.
Those participating in these faiths are thought to make-up at least one-third of Brazil's near 170 million inhabitants.
Many practice both Catholicism and Candomblé.
Bahia, the state with the largest percentage of Blacks, is the capital of this religion, which closely follows its African roots and traditions among the Yoruba people of Nigeria and the Bantu people of Angola and the Congo.
Yoruban traditions, including the most commonly used names of the Orixás (gods of the African pantheon), predominate.
Today Candomblé is officially recognized and protected by the government of Brazil.
However, during the period of slavery and for many decades following its abolition in Brazil in 1888, Candomblé practices were banned by the government and by the Catholic church, and its practitioners were severely punished.
It is less than a month for Angola to experience one of the most anticipated episodes in its history.
Sixteen years since the last elections, Angolans will once again have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming legislative elections, taking place from 5 through 6 September.
The atmosphere is quiet, although there are different feelings among the population.
The more affluent people say they are going abroad; some smile and guarantee that nothing will happen because Angolans don't want war and suffering anymore; while others rush to stores to buy staple goods, just in case the devil pays and things go wrong, as happened in 1992.
As a reminder, at that time the largest opposition party, UNITA, contested the polls and fighting broke out, leading to a resumption of the civil war that ended ten years later, with the death of the charismatic leader of that party, Jonas Savimbi.
When it comes to foreign businessmen based in Angola, they have no intention of returning to their home countries.
The business community is confident that everything will remain the same after the elections and that it is not necessary to change professional commitments.
Jotacê Carranca makes the following reflection on the local atmosphere:
Army commanders ousted Mauritania's first freely elected president in two decades, President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, in a military coup d'état Wednesday after political feuding over the firing of the country's four top generals.
Military commanders announced the formation of a new state council and its leader, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (one of the four fired generals), on state radio and television stations.
General Abdel Aziz was also involved in a 2005 coup d'état in Mauritania.
Algerian The Moor Next Door has been blogging the story intensively and reports:
Talking to informed Mauritanians, some of them saw the coup coming during the summer (as it did), in the autumn, or not at all.
My sense was always that the coup would come this summer (I never wrote this expressly but I expressed this view in discussion and refrained from commenting on the crisis (1) because Western Sahara Info. covered it well and there is not point in competing when you’re one of two or three bloggers paying attention to it, (2) I wanted to make sure that if I “predicted” it I would not be wrong; I could have said, “by the end of May/June/July/August Sidi’s government will be no more” and been wrong; I’m no weather man, and (3) I’ve yet to encounter a Mauritanian that had positive things to say about Sidi beyond his golden personality).
One of the major pressures that forced Sidi to act the way he did towards the end was the threat of a commission being formed to investigate the financial side of his wife’s foundation, which would surely have done him in ever more deeply.
The commission might even have made his administration’s ridiculous personal expenditures public.
For instance, I am told that his air travels alone cost the state some $2 billion, on chartered jets, his family, full entourage, and various other luxuries.
He was between a rock and a hard place: Either he would be forced to step down (a la Olmert) in total shame, or he would be impelled to dissolve parliament and reorganize his government, which would precipitate a coup such as today’s, allowing him to save political face.
Flanked on both sides, he moved in desperation and met his fate.
Western Sahara Info has been blogging the crisis from its outset, and today provided up-to-the-minute information on the coup, including a brief analysis:
Quick analysis, which I may regret: a tragedy for Mauritanian democracy, on the one hand, but that didn't stand much of a chance anyway; but more importantly, a giant setback for the country's broader chances of political development.
While President Abdellahi and his cronies aren't exactly angels, Generals Ghazouani and Abdelaziz represent the very worst military-parasitic element of the Mauritanian regime, and their refusal to let the civilian side of the regime settle down in power threatens to undo it completely in the long run.
If the last coup, in August 2005, could be met with cautious understanding by the international community, having unseated President ould Tayaa, and eventually with praise as it led to a real transformation, this time around it is different.
What happened in 2005 was that a military-personal-tribal dictatorship was overthrown and the chance arrived to replace it with a civilian semi-authoritarian structure that respected most democratic norms most of the time, and which made sensible moves towards national reconciliation, refugee return and economic development; not heaven, but infinitely better.
This change is now being reversed.
Roads to Iraq, in a post entitled "American orchestrated coup in Mauritania," reports the news as well:
Things are happening rapidly in Mauritania, started with a coup this morning, issuing the “statement no 1” on the Mauritanian TV, changing the Head of the TV because he refused to cooperate with the army chief who staged the coup, and announcing a new military junta.
In Egypt, Bella says what happened in Mauritania proved that Arabs weren't cut for democracy.
It seems that democracy wasn't made for people like us - who cannot breathe outside military rule.
After giving us a brief history of Mauritania's young democracy, Bella writes:
This way, Mauritania, which was just about to reap the fruit of democracy in a pioneering move which the entire region was eyeing with excitement, things return to what they were originally, and the military intervened and the coup happened.
Kuwaiti Wild Il Deera poses a few questions about the coup.
ألم يكن الرئيس الموريتاني رئيساً منتخباً من الشعب؟
What is the stance of the Arab League from the leaders of this coup?
Wasn't the Mauritanian leader elected by his people?
How can a political group, like the Arab League, which demands that it is respected in Arab and international arenas allow such a military coup to take place in one of its member countries?
Prolific Moroccan blogger Larbi linked to a news article, remarking:
Whereas coup culture in a lot of countries is a thing of the past (e.g., Syria ain't had a coup in a few decades) some countries like to kick it old skool, harking back to when it seemed like there was a coup-a-week somewhere in the world.
While Mauritania isn't Fiji, they are keeping the tradition of pointless coups alive and well in the Arab world.
The Arabdemocracy blog also has an excellent "obituary" for the young democracy that was.

A moderate earthquake jolted Dhaka city on the 27th of July approximately at 00:51 hours Bangladesh Time (+6 GMT).
Russell John reports in his blog:
I was lying on my bed talking to a friend on the phone, and I suddenly felt that the bed was shaking.
Within 3 seconds, it stopped.
My first impression was that a cat got under my bed and it was shaking it, but then I realised that it's impossible as the bed is way too heavy. (Plus there was no cat, I checked!)
I quickly asked my friends on IRC, and they said they felt it too.
So it was an earthquake for real!
Quake in Dhaka at 12:51 AM!
Russell tweeted instantaneously:
Oh my God, I just felt an earthquake!
Within next minutes, tweets started to appear confirming that they also felt the earthquake.
Munaz of Nothing to Lose and Nothing to Gain shared the tweeter feeds of some of his friends:
Information online was hard to come by (except some Bangla blogs) and everybody was trying to get updates.
So Bauani of Information blog contacted U.S. Geological Survey, National Earthquake Information Center and posted the find:
Magnitude: 4.9
Date-Time: Saturday, July 26, 2008 at 18:51:49 UTC
Location: 24.773°N, 90.480°E
Depth: 5.2 km (3.2 miles) (poorly constrained)
Region: BANGLADESH
He was also posting the updates as and when available.
Apparently no casualties were reported but it rattled the affected people of Dhaka, a populous mega city.
Rumi of In The Middle of Nowhere writes:
Map of all the major and minor tectonic plates of the world If you can locate Bangladesh in the world map, you will see two plate boundaries, i.e. two fault lines cross Bangladesh....many scientists have been warning about the probability of a devastating 8-9 Richter scale catastrophic earthquake in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh.
So, (a) major earthquake is also possible in Bangladesh.
Are we ready?
"Lightning Bolt" - Screenshot by hybridvigour.
Visit his photostream.
This post is going to be as long as Jamaican Usain Bolt's sprint to 100m-dash Olympic glory was short and ever-so sweet - because Caribbean bloggers still have not come down from the high that Bolt's amazing win has created.
9.69 was the magic number that brought the Jamaican sprinter the Olympic gold.
9.69 seconds.
And he did it, to quote The New York Times, "by a mile."
As if Bolt's masterful domination of the "fastest men in the world" field weren't enough, Trinidadian Richard Thompson, who made an impressive showing earlier this year at the NCAA Championships, winning gold in both the 100m and 60m (indoor) events, pulled off an upset and came in second.
Twitter and Facebook were immediately abuzz, with bloggers calling it "the race of the Olympics" and admitting they were "much prouder than usual to be West Indian".
The significance of the Caribbean finishing in first and second place in one of the most prestigious events of the Olympic games soon began to sink in.
This is the first time since the 1976 Games in Montreal (when Trinidadian Hasley Crawford took top honours) that a West Indian has brought home the gold in the 100m dash.
Just as significant an achievement was the fact that six out of the eight finalists were from regional territories.
In the words of Jamaican blogger Active Voice:
Right now it looks like the Caribbean has a monopoly on track and field!
...while West Indies Cricket Blog adds:
It was pandemonium and wild celebrations as Jamaica’s Usain Bolt won the Olympic 100m sprint in a World record time of 9.69 seconds (breaking his own record of 9.72. What was so surprising about this performance is that he started celebrating with about 20 meters to go.
Before heading out the door to join "motorcade in progress in Falmouth", he also notes that the victory was a special one for him, since he knows Bolt personally:
He is from Sherwood Content in my parish of Trelawny.
When he was at high school (William Knibb Memorial High) almost every evening he used to hang out in my video store before going home so I have always watched his progress over the years.
Prior to the win, some bloggers were mischievously making fun of the fact that the "super-drug" behind the stellar performances from the Jamaicans was what West Indians refer to as "blue food" - hearty staples such as yams and other ground provisions.
If Tyson Gay had qualified would they have thought it worthy of carrying, even though Gay's butt would have been quite properly whooped by Usain Bolt?
Sour grapes indeed...Pity Asafa Powell didn't get the bronze...but cho so it go sometimes.
Go through West Indies!!
We proud of unu!!
And sure enough, the proud posts kept on coming.
Jamaican Stunner asks:
How could I not join in the throng of proud bloggers in saluting such a remarkable, record breaking performance, finely executed by Usain Bolt?
The world breaking record was amazing but what was even more fascinating was the fact that Bolt slowed down and started to celebrate his victory from approximately the 80m mark!
What the hell! can you imagine what the record would have been if he didn't ease up?
The rest of the region soon chimed in.
Barbadian diaspora blogger Jdid says:
How aptly named is this guy?
Bolt wow! 9.69 and he was celebrating at the 80m mark.
Congrats!
Big up Jamaica!
Last night on CBC (Canada) they had this discussion about why Jamaica has produced such amazing sprinters over the years...
Moving back to Jamaica seems to have the answer:
If it's one thing that we Jamaicans can be counted on, it's to enjoy the fact that we have the world's greatest sprint factory.
What many don't know is that a major factor in our success is the intense rivalry that exists among our high schools, that starts at age 11 and continues for a lifetime.
Whatever the secret, there was no doubt as to Bolt's ability.
Living in Barbados referred to the World #1 as "a weapon of mass destruction", while Cayman Islands blogger Mad Bull called him "greased lightning", adding:
The only thing is, can you imagine what time he might have got if he ran his utmost best for the whole race?!
He shut down and started celebrating the win from about the 75 metre mark!
I am sorry he didn’t go pedal-to-da-metal all the way through, just so we could see what the man is actually capable of!
Trinidad and Tobago-based Media Watch called the race "Stunning! Fantastic!
Electric!" before going on to critique the poor local MSM coverage of the event - perhaps he should have gone online, where Andre Bagoo was live-blogging the race.
Kudos kept pouring in - from Grenada, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.
As news broke that Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding "has promised a massive welcome home celebration for Jamaica's first gold medalist in the Beijing Olympics, Usain Bolt, and the rest of the Olympic Team", Living Guyana suggested a few ways in which proper homage could be paid to the outstanding Olympian:
If...Bruce Golding...has any sense he would declare Monday a national holiday in Jamaica, he would rename Knutsford Boulevard, Usain Bolt Speedway and he would declare August 16th Usain Bolt Day.
He should be rewarded with land, 9.69 square miles of it in Jamaica.
And a house as well.
But not everyone was awe-struck by "The Lightning Bolt".
While Living Guyana answered BBC Sport's Matt Slater's "Did I just watch a man run sideways through the line, slapping his chest, and still travel 100m in 9.69 seconds?"
Twitter question with a matter-of-fact "Ah, yes Matt, you did.
Your eyes weren't fooling you", Jamaican Long Bench thought the theatrics were a bit too much:
I hope someone reminds him that he is still a human being.
Obnoxious men are are tolerated for only so long, even if they are Jamaican, and no matter how fast they can run.
Amidst his joy for his Caribbean compatriots, Living Guyana felt a twinge of disappointment for the Guyanese Olympic contingent:
The two Caribbean countries which have invested heavily in athletics are seeing the results and enjoying the limelight on the world stage.
These two countries have proper, world class athletics stadia, excellent athletics programmes, fantastic coaches...and in other news Guyanese athletes continue to bomb out of the Olympics without any notice whatsoever.
Still, nothing could stem the overwhelming tide of happiness that washed over the West Indies when two islands at opposite ends of the archipelago brought home the gold and the silver in one of the most high-profile events of the 2008 Olympic Games.
The good news spread from China to the Caribbean, from island shores to diaspora scattered far and wide.
A Mi Ver, who lives in Florida, captured the region's sense of pride and accomplishment as she recounts a conversation with her father, who called from Trinidad to bring her up to speed:
"I decided to break the rules today 'cause we celebratin'," says the old man, "and call you while I'm drivin' on the highway.
Usain Bolt from Jamaica jus' won gold in the men 100 meters, Richard Thompson from Trinidad took silver and the U.S. came third."
He sounds so jolly when he rings off.
*Five minutes later*
"Aye," he says.
"Did I tell you that two men from the Caribbean are the fastest men in the world?"
"Yeah, I think yuh did."
"Well ah gone."
"OK.
Bye, Dad.
Love you.
Drive safe."
"Love you too. babes.
We win, eh!"
A young man who is serving his military service as police decided not to go back to his military unit after vacation and announced the declaration of conscience.
The reason was that he felt guilty after suppressing civilians who attended candlelight vigils.
There have been a lot of responses to his decision, which goes against the government and which means not finishing military service.
A netizen asks about the issue.
What will Mozambique be like in 30 years?
Sociologist Carlos Serra provides nine "Byzantine" scenarios and invites his readers to amend them as they see fit:
Eight years, three hundred and five days ago a peaceful coup masterminded by a Pakistani Army General overtook the reigns of power from the then ruling corrupt leader Nawaz Sharif.
It was then the promise of a new tomorrow; it was then a romantic walk towards the faint vision labeled as the 'enlightened moderation' and definitely a step towards the ridding society of a plague called corruption.
Pakistanis celebrated then, but very soon people realized that this blessing had slowly grown into an unwanted plague and the stay had become an unwelcome dictatorship.
After many moons of tyranny, yesterday marked the end of a reign of power barely 60 days shy of nine years, Pakistan turns over a new leaf.
It seemed to be a normal day for Pakistan but it turned into a roller coaster of adrenaline pumping and rumor mongering session for its citizens as news started to flow.
For the people it was one rumor after another flooding from TV newscasters to SMS's and even emails; it was as if the fate of Pakistan were to be decided by each other.
Deadpan Thoughts quite easily summarizes the roller coaster of rumors in one sentence saying "The phone beeps - Mushy’s being impeached..go put on GEO ..NOW". Some had us believing that this outgoing chap would go down fighting while some on the other hand conspired for the restoration of judiciary as his last vengeance but in the end it fizzled out to be a valiant outgoing speech, throwing in the towel before his tearful adios which Siam's Blog shares 'A grim-faced Musharraf backed by Pakistani flags and a portrait of the country's founder' to say "I leave my future in the hands of people."
Pervez Musharraf - Image credit: World Economic Forum Photostream in Flickr and used under a creative commons license
The tearful good bye on the 18th of August by Musharraf came barely four days after the celebrations of the 61st Independence Day.
Pakistan gingerly marks the end of a long nine year dynasty.
His concluding remarks were mostly a walk back into history as penned down by The Pakistani Spectator, which was just to highlight his services for the people and for the country.
Pakistani bloggers reacted with mixed feelings, on one hand some celebrated Musharraf by chiming in with the 'For he is a Jolly Good Fellow' tune, while some faithfuls were quick to lend him a standing ovation but most cautiously celebrated the end of a dictatorship.
Sarcastically Yeah That too had a few words to share, Ammar wrote about how the new 'Cat Fight' is now about to begin, Chowrangi talks about Pakistan's future after Musharraf, Psychotic Discourses sheds light on the new form of Demon-cracy, MB confuses us with the talk about circle of circuses.
The immediate question that remains lurking is whether Musharraf is allowed to seek asylum outside of Pakistan or will he be put to trial for the charges alleged against him.
Its definitely a tough juncture for Pakistan with a lot at stake.
One does wonder what next, wherein lies a huge mixture of political wannabes eying for the top slot, though the onus of pulling the country out of the mess lies squarely on the shoulder of Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, both unelected politicians entrusted with the faith of a nation to hopefully pull this country out of the mess it now finds itself in.
Ali Kordan, Iran's new Minister of the Interior, has recently been under fire for presenting a "fake" Ph.D. degree from the prestigious Oxford University in the United Kingdom.
Several websites, including the conservative Alef have published a scan of Kordan's "Oxford Honorary Doctorate of Law Degree".
Alef points out that there are several grammatical errors in the so called Oxford certificate, such as: "to be benefitted from its scientific privileges".
Also, "entitled" was spelled "intitled".
Alef has also uploaded several faxes that this site exchanged with Oxford University on the issue.
The website was then filtered in Iran.
While Iranian authorities are investigating this case, Oxford University announced that they have no record of Mr. Kordan graduating from there.
Iranian blogger, Mr. Behi, writes:
President Ahmadinejad performed yet another miracle: He selected someone as interior minister who claimed to have a Ph.D. degree in law from The University of Oxford!
When questions rose on the authenticity of the degree, the guy outraged, threatened the media and produced this to shut them up.
A degree so suspicious that is feared to be faked, with grammar mistakes and with names signing it who are not even members of the Faculty of Law!
If Ahmadinejad wants to fake the next election, he'd better employ someone who does it less obviously.
Mohmmad Ali Abtahi, former reformist vice president and blogger, writes that when he was the deputy of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, he met an Iranian official who had "bought" his Ph.D. According to Abtahi, it seems the price was around US$1000.
According to another blogger, Shirzad it seems that Ali Kordan does not even hold an undergraduate degree.
The blogger adds:
It means he cheated all these years and got paid as a Ph.D. holder...
One of deputies in the Iranian Parliament asked Kordan: "How did you get your Ph.D. in Law, when you say you wrote your thesis in Islamic Education?"
"How did you defend it when you cannot speak English.
Kordan replied, "I had a translator."
Blogger Jomhour says Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defended his Minister and asked, "Who needs these torn papers!"
The blogger asks:
if the certificates are useless, torn, paper why did Ahmadinejad's Minister pretend to have one... It is not the first time that Ahmadinejad calls official documents torn papers.
Previously he has also called United Nations resolutions against an Iranian nuclear program just useless torn papers.
Ali Akbar Javanfekr, Ahmadinejad's media adviser, says the Ministry of Sciences should take a decision about Kordan's Ph.D. and suggests it would be better we not to involve personal political opinions on the issue.
The final results of the Parliamentary Elections disclosed late last night by Angola's National Electoral Commission confirmed the ruling party the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's victory with 81,64% (5,266,216 votes).
The runner up, the main opposition party National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, had 10.39% (670,363 votes).
A total of 7,213,246 Angolans went to the polls, out of 8,256,584 people who had registered to vote - an 87% turnout.
This means that the MPLA makes 191 of the 220 elected Members of Parliament, while UNITA will have 16, PRS 8 and the ND and FNLA both will have 2 seats (click here for a full list of those elected, by region).
Jorge Santos from Leste de Angola was among the first bloggers announcing the following results:
This Friday September 05 was a special day in Angola.
After lukewarm elections campaigning, the population was excited to vote for a new parliament in the first elections in 16 years.
For many people, this was the first opportunity to exercise their right to vote.
Most of the population went peacefully to about 12,000 polling stations, however voting is to continue today at 320 stations in the capital Luanda, due to yesterday's logistical problems that caused delays in the delivery of ballots.
As reactions start to appear on the blogosphere, a full report is on its way. For now here are some pictures showing the run up to the historic day, registered by José Manuel Lima da Silva, Flickr user Kool2bBop, along with his own remarks:
Hook, Line, Sinker by ToastyKen On blogs, through videos and on facebook, Colombian Diego Alejandro is exposing the deceit and scams behind pyramid schemes that masquerade as investment options.
In a country where it doesn't make sense to have a savings account because the handling fees are higher than the interest gained from the savings, these get rich quick plans where citizens can pay to participate and then invite 7 other friends to enroll before they can enjoy sky high interest (between 40 and 70%) on their savings seem like a great deal.
Currently the ranks of those cheated by the system keep growing, and the government tries to establish methods to punish those who take advantage of citizens who fall prey to their scam.
DiegoAlejandro1985 posts a video of people lining up outside one of these investment options known as DRFE, trying to claim their money after the General Attorneys searched the premises and took hold of money that could've been used to pay those with savings invested in the organization, but this search was deemed illegal and the pyramid scheme is still in operation.
Diego Alejandro explains in his blog Denuncias y Más where he's been following the ups and downs of several other pyramid scheme enterprises.
Radio Zamaneh (Persian: رادیو زمانه) is an Amsterdam-based Persian language radio.
"Zamaneh" is the Persian literary term for "time".
Radio Zamaneh (RZ) is an independent broadcasting organisation, registered as a non-profit organisation in the Netherlands, with headquarters and a studio in Amsterdam.
The coordinator of the radio is the Dutch NGO Press Now.
It launched about two years ago and calls itself a 'radio for bloggers'.
RZ has called itself a radio for bloggers.
Why such a slogan?
How much influence have bloggers had at RZ ?
In Iran many journalists have turned to blogging to communicate since many newspapers are continually harassed and shut down.
Most of Radio Zamaneh's contributors were, and still are, bloggers.
Our director, Mehdi Jami, started blogging several years before joining Radio Zamaneh.
As Radio Zamaneh has based its media policy on Citizen Journalism, reaching out to bloggers is natural.
Since August 2006, when Radio Zamaneh started, we have actively promoted bloggers on our site and in our radio programs.
Many were involved in the development of RZ.
Radio Zamaneh in many ways is connected to bloggers and blogging.
Just take a look at our extensive blogroll.
Radio Zamaneh aims for two-way communication.
This is something that blogs are known for.
This is why our site is working like a set of blogs.
Each regular contributor has their own page/blog and readers can comment on every page.
There are several news sites, outside of Iran, such as Deutsche Welle (DW) Perisan site, covering Iranian blogs.
Is there a difference between RZ's approach toward blogging and theirs?
We don't just cover bloggers, we are bloggers and our style is bloggish: friendly, informal, different, personalized, and diverse.
Blogging is a part of our daily life.
We are talking on blogs and quoting blogs.
We see them as a source of information about how people think about politics and social issues.
We see Iranian youth culture as a culture promoted by blogs and we are working to make the informality of blogging a trend in media making.
Radio Zamaneh is derived from and inspired by blogging.
That is very different from just covering blogs by other media outlets.
How have Iranian bloggers reacted to RZ?
Collaborating or criticizing?
A search at Technorati, will show you that there are more than 30,000 links to the items we publish on our site.
In addition, Canada-based Iranian blogger, Arash Kamangir's Didish Report, which searches Iranian site feeds for links to other sites, consistently shows that we are at the top of the list for receiving links.
These show that many bloggers are interested in RZ and referring to us.
Many of them work with us in different ways and some are critical too.
Bloggers are not ignoring what we publish.
We welcome both collaboration and criticism.
In fact, one of our contributors thinks we could use more people poking fun at us.
We invite criticism of Radio Zamaneh and even sponsored a competition with a review of the site as its focus.
This competition helped us discover some of our current colleagues.
Radio Zamaneh has a solid record of publishing differing opinions.
RZ has a list of bloggers in its first page.
Some have criticized RZ for only listing "politically correct" blogs, and not ones that are against the Islamic Republic.
How do you answer them?
The Berkman Center at Harvard University reports that more than 60,000 blogs in Iran are continually updated.
Obviously, we cannot link to all of them.
Radio Zamaneh does not promote bloggers based on their political views.
While we try to remain independent, we link to blogs with strong political points of view, including those that can be seen as *for* or *against* the regime.
We read many blogs and do not limit our list to a select group.
That said, Radio Zamaneh tries not to link to blogs with strong affiliations to political groups or extremists.
Some news sites are afraid to give more voices to citizen media because they consider them as unreliable sources of information.
What do you think?
It's hard to give up control.
Fortunately, most of us have been bloggers ourselves, so we see both sides.
What we normally get from blogs are views, not news.
Any news from blogs must be checked against other sources.
Blogs may be a starting point for a news story, but we do not rely on them as a source.
At the same time, we try to do training and work with citizen journalists so that they can provide reliable information.
In fact, we are currently working on a special training site for citizen journalism which will be for our network and for registered users.
Outside of Iran many Persian sites covering politics, such as DW or Gozarr, have blog sections.
Inside Iran very, very few mainstream news sites have such a section.
Why the difference?
Inside Iran, they want to have more control over what people read.
They just don't have the habit of presenting points of view that they cannot control.
To be fair, major Western news sources have been slow to embrace bloggers as well.
It's not normal for a news organization to link to competing sources of information.
What has been RZ's most important added value to Iranian media?
RZ has proven that it is possible to present an independent take on Iran and the news.
It provides a voice for the unheard, and highlights marginalized groups in Iran: writers, Sunnis, women, bloggers, Armenians, Zoroastrians, and other ethnic and religious minorities.
Radio Zamaneh republishes, highlights, and links to articles written on the web by domestic critics of Iranian politics, which are ignored by domestic media in Iran.
In addition we run programming that challenges the taboos of Iranian society such as relationships and sex.
Sometimes, the challenge is with the official reading of politics and news; sometimes it is with the dogmatic views held by many inside and outside Iran.
What are the most important challenges?
If we want to stay on top of the game and hold on to our audience, we constantly need to stay in communication with them.
You have to have an open communication channel.
We need to encourage more reader and listener participation.
We need to keep our ears open.
We have to stay fresh and be our own harshest critic, and we have to work hard to remain fair and independent.
A lot of people would like us to take sides, whether it's against the government in Iran or for them, but we work hard to remain independent despite whatever personal beliefs we have.
The other major challenge for us is how to survive and make a sustainable media.

How does RZ deal with filtering?
It's a cat and mouse game.
We have to continually find new holes to hide in.
We have changed our domain name 5 times!
We send our newsletters every day to many people who want to read RZ and have no direct access.
But we cannot say that we can evade filtering.
Many pages are blocked.
Despite that, more than 60% of our readers are from Iran.
Sometimes a piece gets published from provincial or local bloggers.
Are there any sharp differences between what Tehran-based bloggers write and provincial ones?
In many ways those who live outside the capital feel isolated and ignored.
For many, Iran means Tehran.
Tehran is very important, but we do not ignore cities in Kurdistan, Khorasan, Azarbayjan, Khuzistan, Fars, and the rest of the country.
We try to see them all and give them voice and confidence and support.
We have a program designed to find good provincial blogs and promote them by quoting from them and talking to them.
We always welcome contributions from provincial areas even though we cannot spend as much time covering them as we do major cities.
Queen Rania of Jordan has been named the most famous Arab video blogger on YouTube by Blogger Times, a blogging magazine run by Arab bloggers, following the success of a series of YouTube videos she launched to shake off stereotypes against Arabs.
لكن ما تتفرد به الملكة رانيا عن الباقي هو أنها الشخصية العربية الوحيدة التي تستخدم الإنترت للانخراط في حوار مع الغرب والترويج للخطاب الإسلامي المعتدل.
Queen Rania Al Abdullah sits inside large office in Amman, Jordon, with three cameras focused on her.
The first and second cameras were for BBC, while the third camera was for her office staff.
The three cameras were recording the latest episode of her program that is broadcasted on a special channel on YouTube, better known as a Vlog.
This is her 7th episode/video since she began broadcasting on Youtube, last March, where she speaks in English asking viewers to discuss the stereotypes they have heard about the Arab world, so she can “debunk them one after the other."
Perhaps the wife of Jordan's King Abdullah the Second, is not the only public figure who uses YouTube, that’s being watched by millions of people.
There are other politicians and kings in different regions of the world who have created personal websites on the internet.
But what is unique about Queen Rania is that she is the only Arab figure who uses the internet to engage in a dialogue with the West to promote a moderate Islamic speech.
Queen Rania says jokingly: “My adolescent son is a quiet person who doesn’t speak a lot by nature, but his impression towards the speeches I gave was ‘good’, and thus the viewers’ impression should be good as well.”
It seems that YouTube visitors agreed with him on what he said, as around 2 million viewers watched the video episodes broadcasted on YouTube; which include along with her recording, contributions from different Jordanian musicians, comedians and citizens.
Queen’s Rania appearing on her channel on the internet, gave her the chance to receive criticism from millions of people.
As she has said to me: “When the idea came to my head, some people looked at me as if I have totally lost my mind."
She continued: “I feel that our world is in a crisis at the present time, violence has replaced dialogue and anger replaced compassion.”
“I hope that this channel becomes a channel for communication and a bridge between the East and West, because I firmly believe our world is in dire need for this”.
This open letter comes after the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) leadership in the central Mozambican city of Beira announced on August 28 that Davis Simango, mayor of the city of Beira, would not run for his second term office for the local elections taking place on November 19, 2009.
As an immediate response to the announcement, angry Renamo and Simango supporters took control of the party’s delegation in protest against president Afonso Dhlakama’s decision of substituting Simango by Manuel Pereira.
The decision sparked off two days of demonstrations in Beira, as Simango's supporters came onto the streets and demanded that the decision be reversed.
On the following Friday night, police used tear gas and rubber bullets against a crowd that had gathered in front of the Renamo offices in the neighbourhood of Munhava.
During the scuffles, a reporter from the Beira daily paper "Diario de Mocambique", Antonio Chimundo, was physically attacked by Renamo members who accused him of working for the ruling Frelimo Party.
Many analysts including some Renamo parliamentarians condemn Dhlakama’s decision and praise Davis Simango for his decision to run as an independent candidate.
The original version of the letter below is available on my blog in Portuguese.
A former Roman Catholic bishop, Fernando Lugo, was recently sworn in as the new president of Paraguay on August 15.
His ascent to power excited those Paraguayans at home, as well as those living abroad.
For those unable to be present in the capital city of Asunción to witness the festivities, photos can be found on his official Flickr account.
The effort of documenting Lugo's appearances and activities started during his campaign in January 2008.
Now, with nearly 2,500 photographs all under a Creative Commons license, the use of this citizen's media tool will be carried over during his new administration.
In the past few days, photographs of Lugo during his inauguration demonstrated the excitement of the historical event.

Fernando Lugo's presidency started with an announcement that he would forgo his monthly salary.
"I don't need that salary, which belongs to the poor," said Lugo.
Different local bloggers see things differently, as one applauds the decision and another wonders how Lugo will pay for his own expenses.
Carlos Rodríguez of Rescatar summarizes the reactions of some in the press who are downplaying the gesture by pointing out that the former priest does not have a wife or children to support, while others wonder whether he will spend the reserved funds at his disposition.
However, Rodríguez sees things in a different light:
While there are no doubt restrictions for women living in Saudi Arabia, they do not necessarily match the oppressive image that many foreigners have of the country.
In this post we have advice for women wanting to visit Jeddah alone, a review of a women-only hotel in Riyadh, and a plea to those foreigners who feel they want to speak on behalf of oppressed Saudi women.
We start with Hala, currently living in the US and blogging at HALA_IN_USA, who is giving advice to a single female friend visiting Jeddah for the first time:
Women in Jeddah are dressed in an outside gown called “Abaya”, it supposed to be worn over clothes so dress lightly beneath it especially in the summer.
The scarf however, is not a must for a female visitor in Jeddah but a preferred thing to wear (for safety and convenience) in traditional places.
There are a variety of places to see in Jeddah, I would suggest the Balad, the old city of Jeddah, with its historical architecture and old houses, Naseef house is a good example of one.
You can purchase traditional goodies from the old shops and enjoy the aroma of Arabic perfumes like Oud and Bukhour, there’s also the traditional handcrafts like the light bulbs or fanoos , the dates, the sweets and the textiles with various colors.
Then, there’s the famous Jeddah Corniche.
I suggest visiting it early in the morning or at 6pm to see the open air sculptures along the sea side, there’s also Jeddah sea-fountain, one of the highest fountains in the world.
There is a variety of food choices along the corniche from fancy eating in restaurants to fast food or even small booths for biscuits and chips.
The local people would sit for hours by the sea side with their children playing around and watching the passersby.
For more of Hala’s advice of what to see in Jeddah, see here.
Meanwhile American Bedu, an American living in Saudi Arabia, tells us what she thinks of a women-only hotel in Riyadh:
The Al Luthan hotel and spa is the first women only facility of its kind in Riyadh.
It is a luxurious hotel and spa for women only.
It is a full service hotel and spa offering deluxe, comfortable and safe accommodations.
Al Luthan welcomes both Saudi and non-Saudi females.
Now some women have spoken out to the media that the opening of Al Luthan is a step backwards.
According to these women, they see it as a backwards movement for the Kingdom due to the fact that there is already so much enforced segregation and women not only have few rights but promoting and endorsing a women’s only hotel and spa further diminishes women from receiving rights.
Maybe I am in the minority but I take the opposite view.
Al Luthan is not unique when compared to the rest of the world.
Women hotels or women-only floors are actually common in most major cities (and some not so major) all over the world.
Back in earlier times when I was doing a lot of international travel, I enjoyed staying on a women-only floor, especially when in foreign cities which were not as accustomed to business women traveling alone.
So to me, I do not see a women’s only hotel as a step backward at all but another nice option to have for women in the Kingdom.
Riyadh blogger Sweet Anger is fed up of foreigners assuming that Saudi women are oppressed, while knowing nothing about their lives or society:
So I was googling one thing or another when I found a post about the abject horror of a reporter in Saudi who was female and was therefore not permitted to stay in the men's section of Starbucks, umm boo hoo hoo.
Now what grabbed my attention wasn’t the article itself, but the comments.
Juuuuuust so we're clear, Saudi is not a bunch of tents stuck together with roaming camels, men in turbans singing "Allah o akbar" raping women cause it’s their right and having a harem of no less then 20.
Oh and we don’t circumcise our women, man that’s just nasty and wrong on too many levels.
Women are not locked up at home and any who are is a matter of the family culture not the country, still with me?
Good.
We're not backwards you morons, we're conservative, i.e. if you want to go and mingle with the opposite sex you go to a specific place.
Now my more important point is, since when do you get off judging people: "Close Starbucks!!
They shouldn’t support them by opening families sections" – umm, excuse me?
I ain’t complaining, and I need my coffee, so seriously man, GET LOST, I didn’t hire anyone to be my speaker.
For those of you who are still convinced we are an oppressed nation and us poor poor woman need to be taught how to fight back and if not well go ahead and fight for us, let me give you a little review of what a regular day in Riyadh is like.
Now yesterday I wake up, make my coffee … get dressed put my abaya on (if it’s too horrific to think about this, think of it as a jacket), pick up my little angel, get in my chauffeured car a.k.a. driver included, drop my girl off, and go to work.
By 1:30 I'm having lunch from Subway with the girls, then go back to work and leave at 4:30, go home, relax, take a shower, get dressed, wait for the driver to take me to the Chinese place since I invited the girls out.
Get there around 9:45 and leave around 12, get home, get online, check my facebook and hotmail, then hit the sack by 2am.
OH MY GOD, WHAT HORROR, HOW CAN I LIVE A LIFE SO OPPRESSED, AAAAHHHHHH!!!!
My point is, some people have no knowledge about what goes on in our life yet they deem it their right to judge and be almighty.
We're different, hell yeah, being different from what you think is right doesn’t make us bad or wrong it makes us us.
Deal with it and butt out.
An illegitimate girl of primary-school age in Zhuhai , South China, was turned away by the local schools, because her mother is not able to afford the hefty fine for illegitimacy, according to sohu blogger Han Tao’s report .
Citizen media videos have been uploaded informing of the situation arising in Venezuela between the Yukpa Indians of the Perijá Mountains, landowners and President Chávez.
This dispute over land limits is 30 years in the making, when military forces displaced the Indigenous communities of the Yukpa by force and established landowners who have cattle ranches and have been working the lands ever since.
The Yukpa Indians have attempted to reclaim the lands taken from them, and even the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez declared 10 years ago that the problems with land ownership in the Perijá Mountains should be resolved, but nothing was done to advance solutions.
Currently the Yukpa Indians have taken over the ranches, and the landowners who live off meat and dairy production are unable to continue their work.
This situation has been made more difficult due to military presence in the area which has caused a siege state, where the Indigenous groups are not allowed to walk freely on their lands or out of them and journalists are blocked from going inside the area to report of Human Rights abuses such as the alleged hiring of Colombian hit-men who have been targeting entire communities and who beat to death a 109 year old indigenous elder.
Finally the Yukpa broke through the communication blocks, have gotten through to the media and have reached the community of Machique on August 26th 2008, and Hugo Chávez has declared that these lands should be given back and the indigenous community's rights should be respected.
In the collective blog Voces Urgentes (Urgent Voices), they pose several questions regarding the future of this situation and its resolution:
The South African Blogosphere just sparked with the recent news of 11 Ministers and 3 deputy ministers resigning including South Africa's star minister, Trevor Manuel and The Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.
Here's what the bloggers are saying...
From Cape Town Property Bubble...
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel is among 11 Cabinet ministers and three deputy ministers who have resigned.
Their letters of resignation had been received by President Thabo Mbeki "which, regretfully, he has had to accept", the presidency said in a statement on Tuesday.
In my own blog, Waiting in Transit the post "South Africa’s Government disbands, WTF?" goes:
“What the Hell?!?” is almost every South African's response right now as the news is coming thick and fast right now with news of 11 Ministers in Government resigning today, including Trevor Manuel (No!
Don’t Go!) including 3 Deputy Ministers.
This after The Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, resigned yesterday citing that she wants to allow the “new president” to choose their own deputies and “personal reasons” (Yeah, right.)
The Ministers who have left are…
Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka;
Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel;
Minister of Defence Mosiuoa Lekota;
Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad;
Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils;
Minister of Correctional Services Ngconde Balfour;
Minister of Public Enterprises Alec Erwin;
Minister of Science and Technology Mosibudi Mangena;
Minister of Public Works Thoko Didiza;
Minister of Provincial and Local Government Sydney Mufamadi; and
Minister of Public Service and Administration Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi.
…and that’s not including the three deputy ministers: Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad; Deputy Minister of Finance Jabu Moleketi; and Deputy Minister of Correctional Services Loretta Jacobus.
Following the President’s resignation, which was a blow enough to the country in terms of stability, etc. and now this… This is DEVASTATING.
With no doubt, this is the biggest Political upset in South African history.
No doubt, the ANC National Executive Committee is probably shitting itself after coming to the decision to chuck Mbeki out of the presidency, citing the recent case against Jacob Zuma in which the case was thrown out of court due to “political interference” (which they blamed on Mbeki)… I bet they didn’t see this coming, or maybe they did, maybe this is what they wanted.
Kgalemo Motlanthe, Zuma’s ally has already been chosen as the care-taker president since the other Deputy President had resigned, os now they have the opportunity to replace EVERYONE.
I don’t know what’s going to happen now, this cannot be good for investor confidence in the country , the Rand is most probably going to get shot to hell and there goes the 2010 Dream.
Negative, I know, otherwise I’m hoping for a miracle.
From the East Coast News Watch Blog...
President Thabo Mbeki has lodged papers in the Constitutional Court for permission to add his name to an application to appeal Judge Chris Nicholson’s judgment.
*Plus, read his full resignation speech *
Mbeki filed the papers yesterday - a day after announcing to the nation that he has resigned.
The move follows Nicholson’s statement in the recent Pietermaritzburg High Court ruling, that Mbeki and the former Justice Minister may have interfered in the decision to prosecute Jacob Zuma.
Last week, the cabinet said it was considering taking legal action over the judge’s comments about political interference.
It is understood that cabinet has also lodged papers in the con court.
Dispatch Now speaks of plans for new Political party in South Africa...
Outgoing President Thabo Mbeki’s mother, Epainette, is backing moves to split the African National Congress (ANC) and form a new breakaway political party.
News of the plans by Mbeki supporters to form a new breakaway party emerged this weekend after the ANC national executive committee (NEC) announced that it had resolved to recall Mbeki from his office. Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, his deputy Mluleki George and Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa are believed to be spearheading the campaign to start the still-to-be-named political party.
On Sunday George would neither confirm nor deny the moves, saying only that an announcement would be made soon.
On Monday, Ma’Mbeki, as the 92-year-old struggle veteran is affectionately known, said she was aware of the the plans and backed the move to split the ANC as she saw no future in the organisation under current president Jacob Zuma.
The East News Watch Blog also wrote of the ANC's favoured candidate for the position of president, before the ministers mentioned above had resigned...
The ANC has confirmed that its Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe has been chosen as the party’s preferred candidate to serve as the country’s interim president after Thabo Mbeki leaves office on Thursday.
The ANC’s Jessie Duarte says while parliament still has to vote on the matter today - that will just be a formality.
“Mr Kgalema Motlanthe is the ANC’s preferred candidate to become the next president of the Republic of South Africa.
He will probably be sworn in immediately after the resignation of President Mbeki takes effect on the 25th of September.”
Many South Africans right now are in absolute shock as to the events which are unfolding before their eyes, what the future holds, no-one knows, all we know is that right now, people are fearful as to the outcome of this situation.

In late September Barbara Hogan was appointed as South Africa's new health minister by interim President Kgalema Motlanthe, ousting her controversial predecessor Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.
AIDS activists and many South Africans are hopeful that this move will signal a shift in the government's HIV/AIDS policies.
Hogan, a veteran anti-apartheid activist and a long-term ANC (African National Congress) member, was previously the chair of the finance portfolio committee.
Since becoming health minister, she has broken from the former government's stance on HIV/AIDS and has
In the past Hogan publicly criticized former President Thabo Mbeki's stance and policies on HIV/AIDS.
Roughly 5.7 million people in South Africa are living with HIV and 350,000 people died of the disease last year (almost 1,000 deaths a day).
Tshabalala-Msimang has also been blamed for inadequately responding to South Africa's HIV/AIDS problem.
The former health minister promoted beetroot, garlic, and other foods as treatment for HIV/AIDS, resulting in the nickname "Dr. Beetroot," and has been accused of creating confusion about anti-retroviral drugs.
Stephen, posting on irreverence, calls Tshabalala-Msimang a national embarrassment and Hogan a glimmer of hope.
Ciaran Parker, blogging on Ciaran’s Peculier Blog, elaborates on Tshabalala-Msimang's unorthodox views:
"Kgalema Motlanthe, while stating a desire to pursue continuity, has got rid of some of Mbeki’s more controversial ministers.
Chief among these is Health Minister Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the chief theoretician behind Mbeki’s AIDS denialist policies.
Mbeki’s government refused to accept the role the HIV virus has in the spread of AIDS, and his health minister stated that anti-retroviral drugs, which have been shown to have some effect in fighting the disease, were too expensive…Medical professionals working in the South African health service who publicly disagreed with the minister’s bizarre theories have been victimised."
Earlier this week, at the opening of the International AIDS Vaccine 2008 conference in Cape Town, Hogan publicly declared that HIV does cause AIDS and should be treated with conventional medicine.
She also said the government was committed to scale-up mother-to-child prevention programs, therapies that prevent HIV-positive pregnant moms from passing on the disease, and that an effective HIV vaccine was desperately needed.
Scientists, activists, and many bloggers have expressed relief and excitement following Hogan's address.
Haley, blogging on adventures as an ambassadorial scholar, says:
"So most people I talk to find it - surprising - that democratically elected government officials, in today's world, would deny such ideas as ... say... that HIV causes AIDS.
However, sadly in South Africa, that has been the case.... but no longer my friends, no longer."
Ray Hartley, posting on The Times, South Africa, blog adds:
"'We know that HIV causes AIDS.'
With these words, the Health Minister, Barbara Hogan, ended an ignominious decade of Aids denial that has cost South Africa countless lives and has forced those with the virus to live in the shadows."
It's difficult to determine how many lives were impacted by previous HIV/AIDS policies, but the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) says that over two million South Africans died of AIDS during Mbeki's presidency and at least 300,000 deaths could have been avoided if he had met basic constitutional requirements.
Some bloggers say that both Mbeki and Tshabalala-Msimang have blood on their hands.
Soneka Kamuhuza, blogging on Things That Make You Go Mmmh!, blames mostly Mbeki.
"Their intellectual apathy, targeted myopia and general dis-ingenuousness played dangerously to help continue the pandemic.
Pushing holistic approaches, which when used singularly, cannot be an effective treatment for the virus, they battered their nation with their fortified and unified ignorance.
It is now estimated that South Africa has the world's highest numbers of people infected with HIV.
Somehow, I see Mbeki's hand all over this…In a country rich with natural resources, he has cheated its most important resource, the people of an opportunity to make a critical head start in the fight against AIDS."
Many hope that Hogan will reverse some of this damage.
A post on peripheries points out that many people expect that the period of politically-supported AIDS denialism in South Africa is over.
However, others remain cautious.
BillyC, commenting on a blog post on The Times, South Africa, says:
"Barbara Hogan has a mountain to climb to reverse the almost terminal damage to health care on Manto’s watch.
Staff competency, morale and levels as well as a slew of health policies and legislation all have to be addressed.
In addition the promotion of voodoo medicine and demonisation of western science is now deeply embedded in the national psyche.
It will take years of hard, courageous and diligent work to get us back to a health system that’s respected and effective.
We can only wish Barbara Hogan god speed.
She’s gonna need it."

Although Bahrain has a number of universities, both government and private, many Bahrainis have the opportunity to go abroad to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies, often by means of scholarships.
One of the first problems they face is that few people know where Bahrain is.
In this post we hear about the experiences of three bloggers who have just gone abroad for higher studies, to Japan, Britain and the United States, and a fourth blogger who has been studying in India for some time.
Cradle of Humanity has just gone to study in Cleveland, Ohio, and she is feeling a little frustrated:
I sometimes dread it when people ask where I come from.
Not more than 10% of people who hear “Bahrain” as answer have some sort of idea where that country might be, but that’s not my cause of annoyance.
For those who know that Bahrain is indeed in the Persian Gulf, there is one thing that comes to mind – wealth.
Some people might ask, but it’s those who assume who annoy me the most.
For the past two months I made a lot of friends, mainly Indians given the demographics of the student body in my program.
Despite the fact that most of these are actually Indian elites, owners of chains of businesses and are wealthy themselves – they love to point out that I must be wealthy.
When at some occasions I said just that, it appeared that some have the notion that we’re unnecessarily wealthy, that is, it’s undeserved wealth; while theirs is hard worked for.
Oh, and they use Bahrain and Dubai interchangeably.
- Public transport here is not very good, but getting a car is very expensive. I would’ve got one
- Used or new?
- Used, I’m only here for a short period of time.
- Get a new one it’s better
- It’ll be much more expensive
- But you come from Bahrain, you can buy a car!
- You mean you’re not rich?
- Actually, no.
- Everyone in Dubai was rich.
- I don’t know about that, but not everyone in Bahrain is rich.
Yagoob, who has just arrived in Nagoya, has to deal with something even more basic - language:
To be honest, the culture shock has hit me very hard!
Hardly anyone I’ve met so far had the slightest knowledge of the English language.
I feel like a 21st century caveman, trying to communicate with the most primitive of ways, hand waving and speaking English in a very slow and loud way.
My dorm room is quite Japanese, extremely tiny and everything is earthquake proof so it’s like living in an aluminium sardine can.
Many of the things I have around the room seem to have instructions on it, but all in Japanese so I have no idea how they work so far!
The subway is quite reminiscent to the London Tube except that it’s much cleaner and a person like me sticks out like a sore thumb (as if a tall fat sweaty hairy Arab wouldn’t stick out anywhere).
The people of Nagoya seem to have never met a Bahraini before, at least that’s what the people at my dorm office say, although I am surprised that they know where it is (maybe because of the many hard fought battles on the football pitch over the last few years) and when I chatted with one of my Chinese neighbours, ‘Andy’, he said, “Aah, you are from West Asia!”
I guess I am…especially when I’m in the Far East.
Perhaps being away from home has its negative aspects, but there is no doubt that there are positive aspects to it too.
I have previously discussed the pros and cons of being away from home; I have no intention of repeating myself, and will write about something different today.
I want to write about contemplation, calm, the ability to read, and the free time which I can spend usefully.
In Bahrain, among family and friends, I don't have much time to read newspapers, whether local, Arab or international.
I also don't have time to read books such as biographies, novels, or those on intellectual topics.
Here in India, there is a lot of time for reflection.
I feel mentally calm and I can think a lot - I find solutions for any problems or obstacles I face and what is even sweeter is that I find more than one solution.
I don't depend on one only, and weigh my options, and if this proves anything, it is a testimony to the mental and spiritual calmness I live in.
I cannot deny how difficult it is to be away from home.
The Earth is the Earth, the third planet in the solar system.
We all studied that and know it scientifically.
But the truth is that our Earth isn't the same when you move from one place to the other.
That land where I lived all my life, with its share of good and bad, and which holds my family and friends is more dear to me than all the world's lands.
Despite the beauty of the land I live on now - it isn't worth a speck of sand from my beloved country.
Here, in the UK, the weather is lovely.
I have seen an autumn like nothing I have seen in my life before.
At school we used to study that there was an autumn in which leaves fall from the trees but I have never seen that with my very own eyes except here.
And while we suffer from the lack of rain in my country, it regularly rains here and makes me eager for life, a life that is rejuvenated by the rains, which make it the oasis it is now.
Am I hallucinating?
I don't see any connection in what I have written on these pages except that they are words that have congested my mind and which I have translated in this small space and this window I look into the world from.
Please forgive me my dear ones.
There is nothing I want to talk about today except for my love and longing for my land and nation.
In 1985, a U.S. Congressman named John McCain traveled to Chile and met with dictator Augusto Pinochet, among other government officials.
The previously unreported meeting was revealed by journalist John Dinges, who published the findings in his blog CIPER , as well as in the Huffington Post, where he writes about John McCain "who has harshly criticized the idea of sitting down with dictators without pre-conditions, appears to have done just that." with "Pinochet, one of the world's most notorious violators of human rights credited with killing more than 3,000 civilians and jailing tens of thousands of others."
Chilean blogger Juan Guillermo Tejeda writes about some of the details of the meeting :
As the US Elections loom closer, international attention to US foreign policy and the candidates has increased.
Projects like Current TV's Collective Journalism and Global Voices' Voices Without Votes have taken the task to gather this information and bring a global perspective on a local issue.
Current TV's Collective Journalism program has started a series of video reports on how the rest of the world views the US.
In The View from Over There, people from many different countries state their views on foreign policy, the war in Iraq, the situation with Iran and mention who they would want as the future president of the USA.
The video interviews are sometimes in different languages, but all of it is subtitled in English.
This video also uses footage from other shows on the US Elections 2008, but this time concentrating on the foreign perspective.
This is something Global Voices and Reuters have been doing for a while now at Voices Without Votes: gathering opinions from all over the planet on the US elections.
If you have any posts you would like to submit to the site, you can do it here.
Current TV's next Collective Journalism assignment will be a worldwide view on the US immigration policies.
In an article published in March, economists William Easterly and Yaw Nyarko noted that in Sub-Saharan Africa, remittances (money sent by immigrants abroad back to their home countries) on average amounted to 81 percent of the foreign aid received by an individual country.
The role of the diaspora in the development of Madagascar has been discussed previously in the Malagasy blogosphere.
Bloggers recently discussed the impact of living abroad on the behavior of Malagasies and how it alters their relationships with their friends and relatives back home.
News2dago narrates how a close friendship with an old friend from school slowly vanished because that friend left for France:
The success of Twitter has had an enormous influence on many new sites, that want to copy the formula: short messages, from all kinds of devices, for a restricted audience. One of the sites that follows this example is Reporting On, a kind of Twitter for journalists, that has been in working in beta phase since last year.
And if you register, you'll find the site is getting quite successful particularly among Latin American journalists.
The structure is very similar to Twitter's; we can write up to 140 characters, which most users take advantage of to write news in the form of headlines.
Each piece of news can be tagged with many words. In the left column, we can find the most popular tags.
We can comment in each others posts as well as reply to them, but we can't follow certain users or filter contents, except for the tags.
Pablo Mancini interviewed Ryan Sholin, who's behind the project, and he points out that Reporting On "is a non profit project financed by Knight News Challenge in order to improve local news, connecting people who don't talk with each other enough".
And he adds: "once the site is working with a healthy amount of applications, I will make the code open source and invite developers and journalists to improve it so they can launch their own versions of the site".
Also talk about Reporting On: Bloc de Periodista (en español); The Exploding Newsroom; Random Mumblings; and Linchpen. At DigiDave you can find another interview to Sholin.
We are all Laila, echo Egyptian female bloggers in one voice.
Who is Laila and why do Egyptian girls and women associate themselves with her?
Read on to learn how Egyptian bloggers are working to break the gender barrier and make their voices heard.
The story starts in September, 2006, when a group of bloggers decided the time has come for them to speak up and share their own stories and experiences, as well of those of other women, with injustice.
The initiative was launched as follows:
In China, an estimated 13,000 children have fallen ill since the tainted milk scandal broke.
Chinese influence has grown in Africa, as have imports of all kinds products, from running shoes to instant noodles.
Bloggers as far afield as Congo and Senegal, concerned about the safety of Chinese products in their countries, are closely following the story.
Blogging from Dakar, Naomed of Le Blog Politique du Senegal penned this short satire, a play on "melamine," the name of the chemical which was added to the fake milk.
("Melamine" sounds very close to "mélanine," the French word for melanin):
South Africa has found a new weapon in its fight against HIV/AIDS – cell phones.
A new initiative will be sending free text messages daily to encourage South Africans to get tested and treated for the disease.
The project, called Project Masiluleke or Project M, was announced last week at the Pop!Tech 2008 conference in Maine, U.S.A. It takes advantage of the popularity of cell phones in South Africa, using them to fight the country's high rates of HIV and tuberculosis (TB).
The first part of the project will send the general public approximately one million free text messages daily for a year, urging them to call HIV and TB call centers.
These messages will be sent as part of “Please Call Me” messages, a type of text messaging widely used across Africa.
White African elaborates on the project and this technology:
"Gustav Praekelt - one of the most knowledgeable mobile phone specialists in Africa - is helping to run the program.
It’s done using the 120 character free space in 'Please Call Me' SMS system that’s used in South Africa. They tack on messages to get people to come to get HIV treatment in private, so that they don’t have to worry about what stigma is attached to that treatment."
Stigma, along with misinformation, are believed to be the main reasons why so few South Africans get tested and treated for HIV.
Even though roughly 5.7 million people in South Africa are living with HIV, according to the project's organizers just 5 percent of the population has been tested for the virus.
South Africa also has one of the highest numbers of TB cases, a common killer of people with HIV.
Project M was created to help combat both of these diseases.
It grew out of the Pop!Tech Accelerator program and brings together an international coalition of partners, including iTeach, the Praekelt Foundation, frog design, Nokia Siemens Networks and the National Geographic Society.
3 Sheep points out that this project's use of cell phones shows how embedded they are in South African culture, adding:
"Many countries do not have an established hardwired infrastructure and are looking to the mobile network as means of mass communication…Previously other media, such as radio, would have been used for such work but the South African project demonstrates the importance of considering all channels for outreach."
Though this is not the first of such projects in South Africa, organizers say it's the largest use ever of mobile phones for sending health information.
And so far the project holds much promise.
Early testing of this text messaging campaign helped triple the average daily call volume to the National AIDS Helpline in Johannesburg.
If the project is successful post-launch, it's hoped that this model can be expanded across Africa.
ahellgeth, commenting on a post on African Globalization, believes that this project has a lot of potential.
"Using technology is a great way to get a strong message across to a mass amount of people.
The use of text messages offer people to view the message over and over, compared to seeing the message on a commercial or a flyer one time.
A text message usually sits in a phones mailbox for a couple of days, allowing that person to go back and view it.
I think the message would truly stick with people allowing them to act on it…These texts are PSA’s for cell phones."
Dave, blogging on Design in Africa agrees that this project will likely be a success:
"An important issue is being addressed, a simple, easy to understand solution has been designed by combining the resources of stakeholders, there are measurable benefits for people and communities and the cost of the incoming message is free.
Brilliant."
But lablady, blogging on Wise Advice, finds it unsettling that technology has taken center-stage in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
She says:
"At what point in time did society make it an easier, more obvious and appealing choice for an impoverished population in the grips of an HIV epidemic, to buy a cell phone rather than a condom?
I find it paradoxical that technology has now become the default vehicle to initiate what would have been at one time, a grass roots blood testing and education campaign.
Is it arrogant of me to wonder why an entire population acquired cell phones before they had access to a successful public health strategy for a preventable disease?"
Catherine Forsythe, blogging on DogReader, adds that these messages may eventually be seen as "health spam."
"The question may be ‘how long will this methodology be effective?’
After an initial viewing, these public health messages may be deleted as quickly as the usual text spam."
Project M certainly hopes not.
Future phases of the project involve distributing at-home HIV testing kits, developing “virtual call centers,” and using text messages to provide personalized healthcare information for those being treated for AIDS.

Iraq: OBAMAAAAAAA!!!! woooohooooo.
So says Neurotic Iraqi Wife.
Overall Iraqi blogs were positive toward president elect Obama, but not all bloggers were happy.
Layla Anwar only foresees doom for Iraq during Obama's presidency:
So Obama, the booma, won the elections. ...
the vice president for the booma Obama is none other than J.Biden.
J.Biden, the Zionist, is an ardent supporter of the partition of Iraq into three statelets.
No wonder Maliki and Co were also backing the booma along with Iran... I am glad that the evil, bastard Bush is out.
No doubt about it.
But I shall not congratulate you on your 44th president.
To hell with all of you and all of your presidents.
To say that Neurotic Wife is pleased with the US presidential election would be an understatement.
She writes:
Change, change, change.
Change is on its way.
Change to the vicious Bush administration.
The Bush administration that lied, tricked, conned the world, and most of all conned the Iraqis. ...
For me, this is not just about history, this is about someone who was able to bring down the very people that broke my country.
And that to me is an enough victory.
You came thus far, and as an Iraqi Im depending on you.
I am expecting many things from Obama.
And disappointment is NOT one of them.
As for all the red neck extremists out there, for all you people who cannot fathom how a black American can be your president, Tough luck.
A BLUE sky.
The start of a new era.
The Obama Era...
And Fatima, an Iraqi American is at last proud.
She declares:
For me, I am so proud of America right now.
Proud of it for overcoming so much, and showing us what it is capable of.
And for me, I really hope that Obama does not disappoint.
I hope that he leads this nation to justice and equality for all, and that he stays away from aggression, wherever it may be.
I hope that he does not become just another one of them presidents.
And finally, I really do salute John McCain on his work and his speech last night.
It was chivalrous, and I hope he rests after his long years of service.
GOOOBAMA!
Long Live Justice, Equality and all this is good in this world!
And Finally
I end with messages of congratulations from Iraqis to America.
Iraqi Mojo:
Americans have elected an African American man named Barack Hussein Obama as their next President.
God bless America!
Sahar:
Am I happy for Iraq?
I don't know.
I don't know what will happen and I'm afraid.
Will he pull out the troops?
Will he care enough to reach a good compromise - fair to the Iraqi people?
But in spite of all my fears, I am so happy for America - You have come such a long way.
You had the strength, the will to elect this man of change.
And with all my heart I hope he puts America on the path to recovery.
To see America again on the pedestal of freedom and democracy, a benign force that heals instead of hurts, unites instead of divides - soon inshalla.
I wish to congratulate you all.
Iraq Pundit:
Over the years I have often found myself defending Americans from such critics as the French or Arabs, who charge the people of the U.S. are ignorant racist idiots.
I have tried to talk to those critics, but naturally I got nowhere.
Maybe the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States will tell them how wrong they are. Only the heartless were not moved last night when Obama was announced the winner of the presidency. ... So congratulations to Barack Obama.
Let no one say this is not an amazing country.
And from Baghdad, Marshmallow26:
Congratulations dear Americans on the elections and the new US president. no matter how the results came out, you hope and we hope that the new president will bring a brighter future to the USA and Iraq.
More than 130 million Americans have been voted.
That is a massive number.
What I like the most about Americans is that they didn't put " race" on top priorities while voting, the majority of white people had elected Obama who is an African descent, because they don't believe in colors or religions but principles towards the country and its people... Once again Mabrook :)
Two months ago fighting resumed in the DR Congo's Eastern province of North Kivu between the rebel group led by Laurent Nkunda and government forces, in violation of a peace accord signed in January.
As many as 250,000 people have been displaced since the violent conflict re-ignited in August, bringing the region's total displacement figure to over 2 million.
Mobs of angry civilians have been attacking UN offices in Goma, North Kivu's provincial capital, infuriated that the UN hasn't been able to protect them.
Fred R. at Extra-Extra gives some background to understand the population's frustration:
… the task fell to cautious, over-stretched UN forces and a corrupt, inept national army barely that was composed of former warring factions.
With the huge country split into myriad, inaccessible local enclaves, it was never going to be easy to resolve all the problems of corruption, mismanagement, inter-ethnic rivalries and power struggles.
But the immediate post-election period offered a real window of opportunity for the new government to unite the country behind a clear vision and (with UN support) determined backing for the rule of law.
They blew it.
Mark Leon Goldberg at the UN Dispatch comments on the population's frustration towards the UN:
Local's are understandably upset that the peacekeeping force had not done enough to stall the rebel advance.
Protests outside the UN compound turned violent earlier this week as residents of Goma hurled rocks at the compound in frustration.
Unfortunately, the peacekeeping mission cannot repel this attack without reinforcement.
It needs help.
Fast.
Fred's post offers a detailed recent background on the situation in North Kivu.
Michelle F. at the Stop Genocide blog offers a breakdown of the “alphabet soup of armed elements” in the DRC for those confused about the actors in this conflict:
-General Laurent Nkunda and his Congres National pour la Defense du Peuple (CNDP) claim to fight for the protection of the Congolese Tutsi population from the DRC's most uninvited and unwelcome guests,
-The Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), or Interahamwe, the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, who set up shop in the eastern DRC following their reign of terror in their own country.
The FDLR's ranks now include a substantial number of Congolese recruits, including chidlren.
-The Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC), the Armed Forces of the DRC, past masters of doing everything a national army is not supposed to do, and -MONUC, the United Nations Mission to the DRC, which, as Michael described, is currently under attack by civilians angered over the force's inability to offer protection.
Refugees International describes MONUC's rock-and-a-hard-place here.
Four days ago the CNDP rebels seized a major military camp at Rumangabo as well as the headquarters of the 3,000 square mile (7,800 square kilometer) Virunga National Park that is home to 200 of the 700 endangered mountain gorillas in the world.
The rebels have used the park as a base but had never seized its headquarters before.
The director of the park, Emmanuel de Merode, wrote about the events on Sunday at the official Virunga Park blog:
Fighting has now totally engulfed the park station and our Rangers have been forced to flee into the forests for their lives.
The rebels now are the only occupants of the park station at Rumangabo.
This has never happened before.
This is a serious time.
We need to get our 50+ Rangers back to safety in Goma, 45km south of Rumangabo.
The main road is blocked because of the fighting so they are walking through the forests of the park south, to Kibumba, about 20km away, where we aim to pick them up in trucks.
We are trying to maintain phone contact but they don’t have much battery life in their phones.
Two days later, 12 of the 53 rangers that had to flee into the forest were rescued and brought to Goma.
Innocent Mburanumwe described how tired, thirsty and hungry they were when the Goma team found them:
The Rangers started off on Sunday at 9am as a group of 14 - and also with 4 members of the military who were also fleeing the rebels.
They walked through the park, often trying to emerge onto the road, but heard many bombs and mortars and so had to go back into the forest.
With no water they tried licking rocks to quench their thirst, and also tried sucking up the moisture from the mud, by putting a piece of clothing between their mouth and the moist mud.
On Wednesday, a spokesperson of the CNDP announced a unilateral ceasefire, although the situation on the ground in Goma remains chaotic.
As Kate Cronin-Furman from the blog Wronging Rights points out, “everyone seems to be preparing for war anyway, probably on account of Nkunda's previously-demonstrated questionable grasp of the word cease-fire.”
Samantha Newport writes about the confusion on the Virunga Park blog:
It’s total chaos in Goma.
I am being told, through various phone calls and text messages, that the army have now laid down their weapons at Kibumba, 12 miles north of Goma, and are fleeing the rebels.
In other words they have totally given up.
The governor of North Kivu has apparently also left town.
Now there is only the UN peacekeeping forces stopping Nkunda’s rebels from taking Goma.
There is lots and lots of speculation right now - and panic.
On another post at the Virunga Park blog, Emmanuel de Merode also writes about the confusion reigning in Goma:
Confusion is probably the only way to describe the situation.
There is a lot of shooting in town, with some heavy weapons further away.
Everyone is staying at home.
There has been some looting, mainly armed men stealing cars and motorbikes.
Laurent Nkunda made a statement on television and radio announcing a unilateral cease-fire, which is encouraging, but unfortunately does not translate into a peaceful evening.
We’ve suffered a barrage of rumours including the invasion of the Rwandan army, Angolan mercenaries coming in from the west, just about everything, none of which is terribly helpful.
This morning Samantha is giving another update on the situation, including a few photos from the compound where she's staying:
The CNDP rebels - Nkunda’s rebels - are in total control of Kiwanja and Rutshuru and have put in their own administration for the area.
The national army, police and administators have all left - so a vast swathe of the province is now in CNDP control.
Innocent had an uncomfortable night.
His neighbor’s house was looted by fleeing military.
Fortunately Innocent, his wife and 5 kids are okay and they were not robbed.
Dawn Hurley, an American expat living in Goma, writes in her blog From Congo about the uncertainty and fear when night falls:
The night here can be a scary thing.
During the day, life seems tenable in Goma.
But night falls around 6:30 here and from then until morning everyone is on their own.
Most people don't have cars, so they can't go anywhere after dark.
And these days, even driving around in a car at night isn't recommended.
Most people don't have power, so they are often sitting in small shacks with their families, praying for the best, listening to shots echo through town, and waiting for daylight.
There is no 911 to call if you have a problem.
At best people call their friends, who have little to offer, other than a voice on the other end of the line.
Colette Braeckman, a Belgian journalist and author of several books on Central Africa, reproduces in her blog the account of Dunia Ruyenzi, a human rights activist in Goma:
There is a bit of sporadic firing in the streets but it is much less intense than yesterday.
The tension is beginning to diminish.
Tomorrow, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa is supposed to be coming to Goma to help with the negotiations.
Louis Michel, the European Commissioner for International Development is in Kinshasa and the Belgian Foreign Minister Carol de Gujt, is supposed to arrive in Kigali.
Let’s hope…
Two weeks ago the journalist Jina Moore, formerly based in Rwanda and who covered the DR Congo as well, wrote on her blog News from Central Africa:
I finally understand that thing I’ve read about in books, where hardened correspondents talk about the desperation they feel to return to the completely screwed places they’ve covered when things take a turn for the worse.
It means something different when you know how that place looks in real life, and something gnaws at your gut, beckoning you back.
Due to a new outbreak of the ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Angolan government has decided to shut down the border the two countries share, in an attempt to prevent the deadly virus entering the nation's territory. Thus, the constant migratory movement between Lunda Norte (a province in the northeast of the country) and DR Congo has been summarily suspended.
It should be noted that the province of Lunda Norte is a gold mining area, a magnet for migrant workers.
Nelo de Carvalho writes at Blog do Nelo Ativado about the border restrictions and the challenges the government faces:

A few days after passing Madagascar, the official toll from the damages caused by Cyclone Fanele have finally come in.
President Ravalomanana president flew to one of the affected areas to assess the extent of the devastation.
Cyclone citizen media initiative
While the BGNRC (department of risk and disaster management) is still without an official website, reports pertaining to the damages are being aggregated on an open-source Google map by two bloggers, Marie Sophie Digne and Tomavana (fr).
Here is a summary of the damages, according to IRIN, via ReliefWeb:
New figures from Madagascar's National Office for Natural Disasters Preparedness (BNGRC) indicate that cyclone Fanele claimed eight lives and affected some 40,400 people The BNGRC said a further 63,000 people were at risk in Menabe if heavy rain continued to fall.
Relief teams are still assessing the damage caused by the two storms, and figures are expected to rise as more information on the full extent of the damage is gathered.
Political turmoil
The Malagasy blogosphere was also buzzing with political news and commentary about a new massive political gathering today (Jan 24th) and a call for a national strike to demand the resignation of the entire administration.
Many bloggers have provided live blogging and images of the event (additional images on facebook).
Blogger Ariniaina provides a brief factsheet on the background of the turmoil:
Andry Rajoelina (or Andry TGV) had a TV Station named VIVA and still have a radio station with the same name.
The minister of the communication has decided to close the TV station VIVA due to a documentary movie that this station had broadcasted.
It was a message from the former President of Madagascar, Didier Ratsiraka Since then, the Mayor ( of Antanarivo, Andry Rajoelina) gave an ultimatum to the government to re-open VIVA TV station before January 13 As Andry didn’t get what he wanted, he invited the people of Tana to go on a strike AGAIN today, January 24.

Blogger Jentilisa provides in-depth analysis of the discourse on both sides of the political spectrum and cautions against the spreading of unverified rumors (mg):
Last week, flooding hit several areas in the Sarawak State of Malaysia.
More than 8,000 people in the Bau District were evacuated in 24 temporary shelters.
The flooding was the worst in three years.
Water level rose up to the waist level.
Flooding in Bau, Sarawak. Pictures from the blog of Denis
a better future advises the government to sum up the lessons of the flooding disaster:
“Immediate relief was going on quite well but the Government could have done better if they had marked all the flood sections of the roads with bamboo poles or other alternatives with clear signs to show how deep the flood level is.
It would have made it easier for monitoring as well as for traffic to decide whether to “swim” through or not.
These markers can be used for future planning especially in the upgrading of the main trunk roads.
“Thus unless we have proper records of flood levels in flood prone areas to guide future planning and implementation of projects, we will have more unnecessary problems due to poor implementations by the respective agencies involved in future.
“Hopefully the Government has learned all the lessons so that future floods will be less disruptive, not only in Bau but throughout Sarawak and if possible Malaysia.
The main trunk roads should be built to be weather-proof, meaning the level to which they must be constructed must be above the highest known flood level.
Police stations and critical government buildings must be sited in non flood prone areas, where possible.
If not, then the site of any buildings should be dumped to raise it above the known flood level at the very least.
Access to these buildings must be also flood proofed where possible.”
The Lost Aborigine urges leaders to prioritize the flooding issue over other foreign matters:
“How about the flood relief to those affected area especially those poor villages like Serian, Padawan, Bau and some in Sibu and Miri?
Why we so busy with Gaza but our own people are helpless and dying?
The Malaysian attitude is that we ignore our household affair and get busy with other issue that it less related to us.”
Nana Natu notes that the flooding was the worst in 20 years:
"Sarawak River showed yesterday its might when it burst it banks and water spilled into Kuching Waterfront.And the floods descrides by Kuchingites as the worst flood in 20 years, caused massive trafic jam, halted business and caused panic among some who anticipated that worst was yet to come.
There were no warnings.
The flood this year is worse then the one in 2004.And the floods caused 119 schools closed."
Sounding Intelligent writes the possible causes of the flooding:
"I am in no position to say what the actual cause of the recent flood is but I firmly believe that it is man-made.
After all, who constructed levees that forced rivers into narrow channels?
Who destructed the wetlands that once absorbed excess rainfall?
Who contributed to global warming?
"Global warming is a real threat.
It is affecting weather patterns, creating a modest increase in violent downpours and melting ice all over the world, causing an avalanche of effects.
“Despite these warnings, some people still continue to be selfish, refuse to switch to cleaner fuels or reduce their carbon footprints somehow.”
The flooding disaster was not limited to Malaysia.
Flooding also hit several parts of the Philippines, Indonesia and Fiji.
Mexico is facing a crime wave, in which both national and foreign citizens are being targeted for kidnappings.
A recent case took place in Saltillo, Coahuila, when U.S. anti-kidnapping expert Félix Batista was abducted by masked gunmen.
Batista was in the country providing seminars as a consultant for the Texas-based security firm ASI Global LLC.
His experience throughout Latin America dealing with this crime is sought after for groups wanting to learn how to avoid this crime.
However, his kidnapping proves that anyone is risk.
The Mex Files has a few questions about the kidnapping case:
If Batista was an expert, how did he get himself kidnapped?
Batista was an employee of a Houston Texas “security consulting” firm called ASI Global.
He reportedly was in Saltillo on personal business, but who was he working for?
Is ASI Global one of the U.S. companies receiving funding for “Plan Merida”… and what does this say about the competence of the trainers?
Some statistics place kidnappings as occurring approximately 2 per day and especially prevalant in the northern border states.
Mexico has the highest number of kidnappings per capita of any country in the world.
These cases affect friends and family of the abducted, such as blogger Tony Scotti, who is a friend of Batista:
I know Felix, and he is a highly competent individual.
Felix is a high profile guy, often quoted in the newspapers and in fact quoted in this month’s issue of Security Management Magazine.
His high profile might have been the catalyst for the abduction.
After reading the newspaper accounts it would be my guess that Felix was set up, and set up by someone he trusted.
El Nahual of México Para Los Mexicanos is worried about what this act may mean for the rest of the country:
Today marked an historic moment in United States history as Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th President.
While Arab support of Obama has been waning over the past few months following the selection of his cabinet and his silence over Israel's attacks on Gaza, across the Middle East and North Africa bloggers still have plenty to say.
A Syrian in London shares a timeline of the past few weeks of Israel's attacks, then remarks:
Not since Kennedy, and some say not never, has an American President has had such attention with such high hopes, from around the world resting on his shoulders.
In his inauguration speech, President Obama said:
“we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord”
“we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.”
“In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
It must be earned.”
“we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals”
Dare we grieve the dead?
Dare we hope for the living?
Jar of Juice, a blogger based in Dubai, felt that Obama's speech was a bit lacking:
While I think Obama’s speech was brilliant - he did not flinch when he said “Muslims” but was trying hard to sound genuine when he “thanked” the imbecile of whom we do not speak of after today - I think there was a crucial element missing in this event... ...but I guess Obama won’t lower himself to acknowledge that fool more than the diplomatic gesture in his speech.
Moroccan blogger Laila Lalami, who is a US resident and admits to voting for Obama, is slightly more hopeful, and glad Obama's day has come:
I’m glad that day has come.
Eight years ago, I voted for Ralph Nader because I thought there really wasn’t much of a difference between Democrats and Republicans on the major issues.
But after the debacle in Florida, the Supreme Court decision, and the abysmal presidency that followed, I learned a simple lesson: Not all politicians are equal.
There are some who are so talentless, so impervious to common sense, so lacking in simple compassion that they make a mockery of the office.
I suppose I’m too cynical now to expect vast differences in government policy but I am still fired up about this particular change, about Barack Obama, and about the departure of George W. Bush.
Moroccan Obama fans are still actively campaigning for President Obama to give his first foreign speech in Rabat.
Using generators for power when necessary, a number of Palestinians and foreign activists are still managing to send out reports on what is happening in the Gaza Strip.
Here are some of the blog posts of the last 24 hours.
Prof. Said Abdelwahed, who teaches English at Al-Azhar University, writes at Moments of Gaza:
Today was a ground offensive.
Many civilians died in the bombing of areas at the edges of Gaza city.
Electricity and water are still major problems for all Gazans.
I am still operating a generator to be able to write those messages in minutes!
Mobile phones are paralyzed and land telephones are static or distorted and other times, it is clear!
An air raid nearby minutes back; we do not know where it was but it was so frightening.
They hit a nearby building!
Its three building away from me; there are casualties!
Israeli aircrafts are throwing down lighting bombs or perhaps it they are lights for military purposes.
Israel intercepted Al-Aqsa satellite channel several times.
They broadcasted anti-Hamas material.
I will be back if could!
Natalie Abou Shakra, a Lebanese activist, also blogs at Moments of Gaza:
they're using new weaponry ... very frightening... as it goes through the air... you hear it very close to you... it's going to come, it's going to kill me, now now now... that's what you think of... it's terrifying... i admit not to care... i have gotten used to the old weaponry... now i have to get used to this one too... i cannot describe in words to you the extent of its terror... like a rocket being projected onto you... and the sound... the sound of a plane in the air coming towards you... magnifying its sound the closer it gets... then it passes above our heads... we are all on the floor
Laila El-Haddad, whose parents are in Gaza, blogs at Raising Yousuf and Noor:
We've heard about the flyers the Israeli army is littering Gaza with - telling people Hamas is to blame for their woes, not their f-16s and cluster bombs.
Now, they have taken to robo-calling the citizens of Gaza a la Hilary Clinton, at all times of the night and day.
My father has received a number of calls – including one as we finished another CNN interview, and we were on skype.
He tried to put the phone on speaker for me.
The rough translations: "urgent message: warning to the citizens of Gaza.
Hamas is using you as human shields.
Do not listen to them.
Hamas has abandoned you and are hiding in their shelters.
Give up now..." He hung up in disgust, not wanting to hear the rest.
The army has also been calling people to let them know their houses will be targeted.
People have stopped answering their phones now, and do not take calls from unknown numbers from fear.
Sharon is an activist who blogs at Tales to Tell, and like many of the international activists in Gaza, is doing what she can to assist ambulance workers:
7.30: Ambulances called out.
We are unable to pass a huge crater in the road into which a car has already nosedived.
Taking the long way round, we collect a man in traditional dress, in his 60s, from what seems to be his family farm.
He is bleeding from the face and very frightened.
On the way to Karmel Adwan hospital a particularly close explosion rocks the van.
I mustn’t have jumped enough, because the driver mimes “did you hear that?” to me.
I am beginning to realise Palestinians are fond of rhetorical questions, such as “how do you find Gaza at the moment?”
10.55: We leave Al Shifa to head back to the Jabalia Centre.
There is coffee.
Mo makes a coffee sandwich, which is just weird.
There is a pause in the calls.
Hassan asks me about my book, “Nature Cure”; I explain it is about an ecologist’s route out of depression.
“People get depressed in the West?” he asks in surprise.
Understanding how implausible that must sound right now, I say that many people get caught up in a life that mainly holds work and buying stuff, and without some sort of meaning - religion, or the dream of your land being free, or something like that, people can get very lost.
“Actually Israel is trying to force us into a meaningless life like this,” he says. “Like, sometimes I feel that all that really matters to me right now is a kilo of gas. I built a stove for my family and I feel like I did something amazing.”
In another post she tells us:
We asked the Jabalia Red Crescent admin person how much of the emergency calls Israel is not letting them go to.
These are in areas where co-ordination must be made with the invading forces via the Red Cross to enter.
He said they are not being allowed to attend to about 80% of the calls from the north, covering the Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia area.
Shall I repeat that? 80%.
Eight of ten people calling for help are being prevented from receiving it.
Canadian activist, Eva Bartlett, blogs at In Gaza:
The numbers slaughtered and injured are so high now – 521 and 3,000 as of this morning, Gaza time — that sitting next to a dead or dying person is becoming normal.
The stain of blood on the ambulance stretcher pools next to my coat, the medic warning me my coat may be dirtied.
What does it matter? The stain doesn’t revolt me as it would have, did, one week ago.
Death fills the air, the streets in Gaza, and I cannot stress that this is no exaggeration.
Back in Gaza city briefly, after a day and night again with the medics, I’ll try to summarize, though there is too much to tell, too much incoming news, and it’s too hard to reach people, even those just a kilometer away.
Before dropping me off, the medics had gone to different gas stations, searching for gas for the ambulances.
Two stations, no luck.
Some at a final source fills their tanks.
The absence of gas is critical.
So is the absence of bread, which goes on, the lines longer than ever yet.
A text tells me (at this point I have to rely on news from phone and text messages, when reception is available) that the UN says 13,000 have been displaced since these attacks, that 20% of the dead are women and children, 70 % are without drinking water.
There are many more facts to sober one drunk on apathy, but I can’t source or share them now.
Safa Joudeh writes at Lamentations-Gaza:
Israel has come into our homes, is fighting us in our streets and is expressing its brutality against us in full force.
How do we react?
All Palestinian factions have united and are out facing the enemy, using all the military capabilities that they collectively have.
Although these capabilities are incomparable to the military strength exerted by Israel, yet it has made us more certain than ever that Palestinians will fight to the very end to protect their own.
It has shown us that resistance, courage and love are an integral part of the Palestinian identity that will never change despite all the hardships we endure.
It has given us a moral boost, which comes at a time when we need it most.
It's hard even to remember a time when basic necessities such as food, water, warmth and daylight weren't a luxury.
At this point, bare human instinct is at work, the need to protect your loved ones, the need to ensure shelter and the instinct of fight or flight.
We have fled for too long, Gaza is our last refuge and our home after we were displaced from what is now called Israel.
All this happened but 60 years ago.
What more could they want?
We have nowhere left to go.
Now is a time when all forms of resistance are legitimate.
They have disregarded every single international law there is.
So now is the time to fight.
RafahKid makes a plea:
Please...before everyone in Gaza is dead...perhaps try to understand that Hamas is a symptom....not a cause....the Occupation is the cause....the lack of a settlement for the forcible removal of people from their land....this is the cause...Hamas is a symptom....and the US doesn't like governments it doesn't choose.
No electricity...no outgoing calls.
Darkness and it's raining fire.
The children are screaming.
Mutasharrid (‘homeless person’ or ‘vagrant’) is in Khan Younis, and is angry:
I was asked yesterday whether the aid to Gaza was really getting in or if it was "newspaper talk".
I refused to respond because the answer is clear, as clear as the sound of F16 strike right now: never mind, the aid got into Gaza, maybe in great quantities in the first days, but stopped two days ago on the pretext of the ground operation, however, that did not count for much!
I mean, how have the media succeeded in presenting the case of Gaza as one of a hungry person under siege, searching for food and "humanitarian" aid not worthy of dogs?!
When I asked my friend he said, "The Arabs are like a person firing on a dog and throwing it a piece of meat!"
Gaza is not searching for an aspirin for its bloody wound, my friends, Gaza is not searching for a bandage for its continuous bleeding.
What hurts Gaza, indeed kills it more than rockets, are their voices: the voice of every person wearing a suit and tie speaking about Gaza.
You wish you could scream in their faces, before the aircraft, "Stop!
Your voice is wounding and is damned sharper than your silence, so stay silent… Have mercy on us, stay silent a little while..."
Exiled (المنفي) says simply:
I am off till the end of this Massacre
Pray 4 us
A blog called Harm to civilians during the fighting in Gaza and Southern Israel has been set up by Israeli human rights groups to document events that are not being covered by the media.
Under normal circumstances and despite a high rate of literacy, Palestine's Internet penetration rate stands between 13 and 15 per cent (including both the West Bank and Gaza).
Given the ongoing attacks on Gaza, however, Internet access has been significantly diminished.
Although there is a small number of bloggers writing directly from Gaza, many Gaza residents are instead sending text messages and making phone calls abroad in the hopes that their stories will be told.
Mohammad of KABOBfest, who is based in the West Bank, has been reporting on Gaza for several days now.
In his first post on December 29, he tells us:
I wanted to call my uncles and check up on them and their families, but for most of the day I couldn't.
I was too afraid to know the state they might be in.
But when I did call, I was pleasantly surprised.
My uncle Jasim told me things were much better today, there was still a fear but people had begun to recover.
We've managed to absorb the shock of that initial attack, he said, and that is helping us get by today.
He said the sky had been quiet for about half an hour over Khan Younis, but the warships were attacking the shore. His voice was strong, just like it was when I'd talk to him at any time before the massacre began, and told me to not worry so much.
They had no power, as usual, so I told him about the ongoing demonstrations and clashes in the West Bank and the outpouring of support across the world.
I told him that nobody has forgotten them, and he told me to just keep praying for them.
His youngest kids were asleep, but his daughters, Haneen and Yaqeen, were still up.
I told him to tell them we're all thinking about them.
Next I called my uncle Mahmoud.
Yesterday, he told me he was waiting for death.
The Israeli army had called him and told him they would bomb his home within a few minutes.
It had left us all terrified, but today he told me it had become apparent that the Israeli army had sent that message to tens of thousands of homes.
It is a sadistic and cruel tactic, designed to terrorize hundreds of thousands inside their own homes.
But his hopefulness soon disappeared.
On January 3, Mohammed reported again:
I managed to get through to my uncle Mohammad again in Gaza City.
For the duration of the phone call, an explosion would be heard every 20 seconds or so.
In the bitter cold of the night, terror is blanketing the people of Gaza, and Gaza City in particular.
The gunfire and explosions are framed against a background of a blackened sky buzzing with invisible war planes and attack helicopters.
Nobody knows what is being hit.
My uncle tells me there have been explosions all around them, near and far, from all sides, but even the local radio, which so far has been excellent at reporting what happens on the ground, cannot determine what the targets are that are being hit.
Nobody is sure if the airstrikes are targeting homes, buildings, mosques or previously bombed sites, therefore nobody knows if any change in tactics has occurred.
In war, for civilians as much as for soldiers, there isn't much that is more terrifying than not knowing.
In a third post, he details calls with several family members across Gaza, comparing the situation on the ground from Gaza City to Khan Younis.
He describes one phone call with his uncle's wife:
I talked to Areej again.
She had calmed down somewhat, but still sounded very scared.
I asked her about the kids.
She said the baby, Yazeed, was asleep next to her.
Dina had also fallen asleep, and their mother had told Nada and Haya to go to their room, where it would be safer.
I asked her if they were keeping warm with the windows always open to the wind, and she said when they sleep they wear as many layers as they can and are covered in as many blankets as possible, but during the day and evening it does get very cold.
I asked about Adham, her 11 year old son.
She told me he had lit two candles and laid out his toys and was trying, despite the cold and fear and shelling and death and trauma, to play.
He had lego blocks and toy cars, and some toy soldiers.
I didn't bother asking her what he was doing with the soldiers.
I didn't want to know.
Global Voices' own Ayesha Saldanha of Bint Battuta in Bahrain has also been posting updates from friends in Gaza.
Today's SMS update from her friend Hasan includes a telling last line:
6.30 am: "Neither the telephone nor the electricity is working.
I have just got up and saw your sms.
I heard very loud tanks shelling outside.
Apache and the drone .
They might be nearer we don't know"
8.20 am: "Still not near. i hope so.
If electricity keeps off like in gaza we won't be able.
I am trying to call my sister or text her but in vain"
1.30 pm: "my wife asked why are you frowning.
Give me anything that might give me a hope and I will smile I replyed.
Today after the lists of our needs became too much.
Medicine, food, cleaning material.
I decided to go downtown although they struck a market in Gaza.
They killed 5 and injured a group of people.
As I entered the market F16 struck 2 houses very near to the market.
All the people thought like me.
Either the market or the mosque.
I felt panic.
I bought half our needs and hurried home.
In my way they struck another house near my home.
The tanks shelled a lot last night we were very worried" 6.30 pm: "If things got worse I'd put my in my wife's mobile.
F16 is shelling right now. and the sound of the ambulance is loud.
Everyday is worse than the previous"
At approximately 6:00 p.m. (GMT+2), Al Jazeera English reported that a UN school was hit when two tank shells exploded outside of the school.
The school, located in Jabaliya, had been set up days ago as a shelter for Gaza residents who had lost or evacuated their homes.
According to Al Jazeera English, more than 40 people were killed.
On Al Jazeera English's television station (accessible globally via Livestation.com), it was reported that the IDF had been given GPS coordinates to all UN schools.
The Philistine reported quickly on the incident:
Medical officials say the death toll from an Israeli airstrike outside a United Nations school in the Gaza Strip has risen to 30.
The attack occurred about 10 yards (meters) outside the school in northern Gaza.
It was the second deadly Israeli attack to strike a UN school in the past few hours.
Hospital director Bassam Abu Warda confirmed the 30 deaths from the second airstrike.
In both cases, the schools had been used as shelters for people displaced by Israel’s offensive
A top U.N. humanitarian official has condemned the violence and demanded an investigation.
Israel isn’t commenting.
Syria News Wire also reported quickly, stating:
40 people have now died after Israel’s bombing of a UN school in Gaza.
400 Palestinians were being given shelter there by the UN.
Twitter user dominiccampbell, from London, reacted strongly to the news as well:
Finnish Twitter user haloefekti expresses shock at the lack of outcry:
While several Iranian bloggers (including Islamist ones) multiplied their posts and digital initiatives, such as a "Google bomb" to condemn Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip, some other bloggers are saying the Iranian government is using the "Gaza conflict moment” to repress media and civil society inside the country.
Last week, Iranian authorities shut down, Kargozaran, a leading reformist journal, because it published a statement of a student movement (Tahkim Vahdat) that condemned Israel but also referred to Palestinian militant groups who take refuge in hospitals and schools as terrorists.
Nik Ahnag, a leading cartoonist and blogger, has published a couple of cartoons about the Gaza invasion and the inequal power balance between Israel and Palestinians on one side, and Iranian government repression on the other side.
One of these cartoons shows a huge hammer labeled Gaza hitting the Kargozaran journal.
In the cartoon, it seems that teachers, women and students are the next targets in line.
Blogger Jomhour writes about the statement that led to the closure of reformist journal.
He says :
With the war raging in Gaza, news reports earlier this month about the routing of an extraordinarily large shipment of arms from the United States to Israel through the private Greek port of Astakos caused an uproar among Greek bloggers.
They used Twitter to investigate the matter and put pressure on the government to halt the transfer.
Delivery of the munitions was suspended, just as the Greek government was coming under fire from opposition parties, and Amnesty International was calling for an arms embargo.
At first, official sources contested the story from the international news agency Reuters on January 9.
But it was picked up by Twitter users and investigated after Indy.gr - an offshoot of the Indymedia Athens group - provided a translation of the article in Greek.
The idea to organize an embargo of the port was proposed and widely "re-tweeted":
itsomp: http://is.gd/f8Wa Can we organise an embargo of the port of Astakos?
Only the US and Israeli ships...
Some tweeted direct queries to the Greek foreign minister, whose web team is operating a Twitter account:
Bloggers in Bahrain are fuming at a decision by the country's Minister of Information to block access to scores of websites, as well as prevent access to proxy sites which enable surfers to get to sites in a roundabout manner.
Ammaro is defiant:
MINISTRY; HERE'S A SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR YOU.
YOU CAN BLOCK A DOOR, YOU CAN BLOCK TWO, BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO CENSOR THE INTERNET, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
THERE ARE A MILLION AND ONE WAYS TO GET AROUND YOUR BLOCKADES, AND YOU'LL NEVER KEEP UP WITH THEM.
Rayyash says: I was surprised when I read the order issued by the Minister of Information to block websites on the Internet.
The reason I was surprised was not because of the part related to banning pornographic sites which I agree with and call for censoring, but the part which says that any other site could also be blocked.
The reason for this is that I don't believe that Arab governments have good intentions
Hussain Marhoon has a slightly different position: In principle, I am against the banning of websites altogether and that includes porn even though I don't know the value of being "against".
I know that there is a religious wave that is starting to have an impact on all areas of our life.
Jenan asks: Why don't we enjoy freedom of speech and where are we as regards liberalising expression?
Mohammed Marhoon also has a question: Aren't we in the era of reform and transparency?
There is no excuse for imposing a guardian on the sender and recipient at the same time!
The Redbelt says:
Let me try to paint you a picture:
It is the 1980’s.
No internet and no Satellite TV channels and nothing.
The only communications we have with the outside world are videotapes, cassettes, books and magazines.
In these simpler times, banning something would actually work.
If the government says for a reason or another that a film for example is unacceptable and not wanted, the majority of the population, if not all, will not get to see it.
Tapes will be easily found and confiscated.
And then what?
Banning media at that age was quite effective.
But that was a long, long, LONG time ago.
Just look at my brother, he was a mere idea in ’86 and was born in ’87.
Today he is a 186 cm tall man, with a goatee, driving license and a college degree.
Media has grown that much too.
Eyad wonders about the business logic:
Let’s not look at the internet as the super highway of information but look at it as a product, the people in their homes are paying a good amount of money and on a monthly bases just to access the internet and have a good time doing so, based on that fact are heavily investing in networks and technology to get that connection to every home and business in the country; what if people based on giving these circumstances stop subscribing to internet services or resorting to other options like subscription sharing, how can these ISP’s justify their investment and effort to improve services when the Government is not helping at all.
Funaki says:
We have been blessed with a mind of our own that we can use to make decisions and distinguish between right and wrong.
I don’t need anyone from outside coming and telling me what is right and what is wrong.
Yagoob makes a similar point - and has a request for the Minister:
People should be free to do whatever they want online, whether it’s safe or sinful is really none of the government’s business... We are not cattle that need to herded and shown the ‘righteous’ or better put ‘the government’s’ way.
Your Excellency, blocking these websites will in the short and long term continue to undermine the freedoms given to the Bahraini people through the constitution and depriving useful websites from the residents of Bahrain for no reason whatsoever.
Please reconsider and lift the ban off these websites and let us as a people grow more knowledgeable, educated and inspired…
Hussain Yousif says:
I would like to thank the government for reminding us that Bahrain is still a new version of a third word country where freedom is something to talk about but not to experience.
Silly Bahraini Girl is scathing:
This isn't yet another move to curtail my freedom of expression as I am free to say and write what I want, not that anyone will listen to me.
What I am not free to do is surf the Internet as I please, because I am a child in the eyes of the authorities - a child who should be told what I am allowed and not allowed to read.
And since no one is listening, I would like to thank the authorities for blocking access to all those websites and would like to request it to block access to the entire Internet as frankly, we have no use with it.
Sous, a Swedish woman living in Bahrain, is furious:
THIS IS INSANE!
IMMENSLY INSANE!!
I CAN’T BLOODY BREATHE!
THIS IS INSANE!
Suad wonders: ماذا استفاد المواطن أو الدولة من قرارات الحجب غير تراجع سمعة البحرين ومسيرتها الاصلاحية وانعدام الشفافية وانتهاك حرية التعبير وإرجاعنا الي عصور التخلف والظلام؟ Don't officials think of the negative side effects of their decisions and on the importance they give to sites which have no value or standing in society.
Don't they think that more people would want to access those sites now that everything which is illegal becomes more desirable?
What did the citizen and the nation benefit from those bans except for the tarnishing of Bahrain's reputation and its reform progress, its lack of transparency, its aggression against freedom of expression and our return to the dark ages of backwardness?
Mohammed Zainal is in disbelief:
It is sad, seriously its not funny, my previous post was about how technology is evolving and how people are using it to develop new applications everyday, changing the media landscape, inspiring people with the web2.0 ++ tools and elements …
Is this what our “Age of Engage” ought to be?
Again, I see no technical benefit from the ban and while I don't agree with the explosive sectarian situation, I accept that what is happening is a result of real people in crisis and immersed in sectarianism.
What is happening on the forums reflects, to a large extent, the opinions of a large sector of our society.
And the political solution remains not in the hand of the Minister of Information or anyone else
Hayat questions how the decision has been made: I believe that blocking those websites is primitive and backward and breaks the rights of freedom of expression and access to information.
There is no democracy without freedom of expression...and no constitutional democracy which blocks websites...and it is not right to ban those sites through administrative orders which are arbitrary and which are taken by members of the executive authority, the judiciary and National Security Apparatus...It is not correct for these authorities to intertwine and work together and if they do...where is the separation between the different branches?
Khalid says: I believe the that judiciary is the only legal authority which can make decisions on whether or not to ban any website
Qassim Ahmed has an idea: ...the Bahraini authorities want to block the Internet to make people cry over what was blocked, so that when they once again open up the sites for porn, violence and downloading movies and proxies as well as others...then people will say: "Freedom is now back again!"
In another post, Ammaro has decided he's figured out what's really going on:
Remember the Matrix?
Remember how the whole world you lived in, which you believed was real, was in fact completely made up?
Just a mirage?
That's probably what the internet is in Bahrain.
The internet was all a mirage created by the Bahrain government, to let you think that you're connecting to the outside world, when in reality we are kept very isolated from everything and everyone else.
All the sites you've ever visited were set up by creative individuals in the Ministry of Information; every single one.
There's a guy who writes the CNN website, and makes up the world news, another guy who writes the BBC website.
It's sort of obvious that they're sitting next to each other when doing this; the news is almost exactly the same on both sites... We've been living a lie.
The new website bans aren't really websites being 'blocked'.
It's actually a side effect from the Global Credit Crunch, where the Ministry has had to fire a large number of employees because of a shortage of funds, and couldn't sustain as many websites as it used to.
Therefore the ban.
United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Indonesia last Wednesday.
She affirmed “Indonesia’s role in handling global problems, including terrorism, protectionism, climate change and the economic crisis.”
Indonesia is the largest Muslim nation in the world and the third largest democracy.
Aside from meeting the leaders of Indonesia, Clinton found the time to visit a slum community in Jakarta.
She also appeared in a teen-oriented TV show.
Everything Indonesia believes Clinton's visit to Indonesia starts a new era in American foreign policy:
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Indonesia starts a new era in American foreign policy.
A lot less unilateral arrogance, a lot more inclusiveness and so-called smart power.
Mbak Rita observes that Clinton looks younger today:
"I really think that she looks younger and more goodlooking, maybe it was because of her constant smile she gave during her visit here...Some people on some boring TV talkshow mentioned previously that Jakarta is a little overreacted with her visit.
I am glad that I was wrong about that."
Devi Girsang was surprised about Jakarta’s traffic on the day Clinton arrived:
As a Jakartan who used to stuck in traffic, I tend to be panicky if the streets are quiet and deserted look-alike.
There are only two things popped in my mind in that case; there's a bomb terror or rampages.
Remember 1998 Jakarta riots or 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing?
Then you must know what I mean Around 2 PM today, it turned out to be US Secretary of States Hillary Clinton's arrival in Jakarta that stopped the traffic!
Lucky for me, there's still battery power remained on my digital camera to take a few snapshots.
Therry, in a comment, wonders if the US sent a fake Clinton:
I saw the speech Hillary made on television and I don't know whether it's just me but that woman doesn't look exactly like Hillary.
I'm starting to think the US government sent a fake one to us, because that woman looks too old and motherly to be Hillary!
Not everybody was cheering the visit of Hillary Clinton in Indonesia.
Picture from Jakarta Today
Andreas Harsono wanted Clinton to raise the issues of religious freedom, impunity, and military reform during her visit:
"(Clinton) should be careful not to say that Muslims in Indonesia are “moderate,” as most diplomatic visitors like to say.
For members of persecuted religious groups in Indonesia, it is a useless and inaccurate cliche.
"Concern over rising religious intolerance is not the only human rights issue Clinton should raise with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
Freedom of expression is also a huge problem on islands where ethnic minorities show their resistance toward the Indonesian state.
But in Indonesia, even peaceful acts like a flag raising can land you in jail for a long time "Clinton may be tempted to gloss over issues like religious freedom, impunity, and military reform, in favor of closer Indonesian-US ties.
But if she does, she’ll miss a golden opportunity to transform the lives of many people in Indonesia who need pressure on the government to recognize their rights."
Via Twitter, below are some reactions to the Clinton visit:
waxinglyrical: someone asked who is Hillary Clinton??

An interactive map of endangered languages, showing 2,500 out of 6,000 tongues at risk, has been released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The international organization asks users to contribute comments to a project that has many bloggers worried about preserving cultures.
Iglesia Descalza, a librarian, blogs:
As someone who loves languages, I am chagrined to read the news coming out of UNESCO's presentation of the updated Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger of Disappearing.
According to the Atlas, unveiled on the eve of International Mother Language Day (21 February), nearly 200 languages have fewer than 10 speakers and 178 others have between 10 and 50 speakers.
The data shows that out of the 6,000 languages currently in existence, over 200 have died out over the last three generations, 538 are critically endangered, 502 severely endangered, 632 definitely endangered and 607 unsafe.
As the last remaining speakers of a language pass away, the language itself dies.
The language of Manx in the Isle of Man died out in 1974 when Ned Maddrell, the last speaker, passed away while Eyak, in Alaska, United States, met its demise last year with the death of Marie Smith Jones.
We need to prize bio-diversity, cultural and racial diversity, and linguistic diversity because we lose too much by becoming homogenized into one big, white, English-speaking society.
While disappearing languages are mostly those of indigenous peoples faced with globalization and state-nationalism, Daniel Moving Out, a blog by a Portugal native now in the UK, says not all “unofficial” languages are dying out:
The Galician sounds like a cross between Spanish and Portuguese, somewhat like a dialect originated from the second and enriched with vocabulary and accent of the first.
The language is originated from the Galician-Portuguese of medieval times, and it was spoken at all the County of Portucale.
This week, the Unesco atlas of world languages was released, regarding Galician as a strong language among those that are not the main languages of any country.
It receives protection from the Castilian (common Spanish) from being geographically close to Portugal.
The blog, nonetheless, summarizes some of the worst data:
199 languages have less than a dozen of native speakers.
In Indonesia, the 4 remaining speakers of Lengilu talk within ; the Karaim in Ukraine is kept by only 6 people.
Over than 200 different languages have disappeared in the last 3 generations.
The Manx, from the Isle of Man, here in the UK died with the last native speaker in 1974.
But not everyone is concerned with disappearing languages.
Commenting on TED blog, user Magnus Lindkvist says:
Why do we insist on romanticizing ancient languages that arguably noone wants to speak anymore?
What about the hundreds of new programming languages that have sprung up in the past decades?
Or the infinite variations of English that people are adopting and "remixing" to make their own around the world?
These are real languages and show a lot more vitality than Manx and Tirahi.
Abdullah Waheed, a native speaker of Dhivehi – an "official" language yet one with not many speakers in Maldives – explains in one example why language preservation matters:
Dhivehi language is absolutely vital to the identity of Maldivians as a people and Maldives as a country, because it is the only feature we all share and which few others have.
It is a strategic factor in our advances towards sustainable development and the harmonious coordination of our affairs.
Far from being a field reserved for writers, Dhivehi lies at the heart of all social, economic and cultural life.
Dhivehi does matter to all of us.
It matters when we want to promote cultural diversity, and fight illiteracy, and it matters for quality education, including teaching in the first years of schooling.
It matters in the fight for greater social inclusion, for creativity, economic development and safeguarding indigenous knowledge.
After weeks of largely peaceful protests in the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique, things took a violent turn on Monday, as police and demonstrators clashed in Guadeloupe's largest city, Pointe-à-Pitre.
Workers are protesting skyrocketing unemployment and the rising costs of basic necessities, many of which are imported from France.
On the citizen media website, Agoravox, Illiouchine, a métropolitain , describes the scene in Guadeloupe this weekend and the calm that followed Monday night's violence, an unfortunate turn of events
Last weekend, the Haitian blogosphere was buzzing about the exclusion of political parties from the April 2009 Senatorial elections by the Conseil Electoral Provisoire or Temporary Electoral Council - and on Friday January 6th, the CEP published a list of the candidates for the next democratic parliamentary elections in Haiti.
Vario Sérant presents in Alterpresse a list of the rejected candidates:
Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, a British social film based on a novel set out in India made a clean sweep at the The 81st Academy Awards Ceremony.
Its British and Indian crews bagged 8 awards including the best picture award.
It was truly India's day as 'Smile Pinky', another short documentary based in India also won an Oscar.
A section of the 'Slumdog Millionaire' casts in Hollywood- photo by Flickr User KaushiK™, used under a creative commons license
People from all over the world watched the awards ceremony.
Some were live blogging the event like Sepia Mutiny.
There were hundred of Twitter messages appearing in a minute during the live transmission where voices like Raajesh said:
Prerna at No Borders and Binaries said:
A horde of Indian invaders and their British allies on tourist visas took home the coveted and prized Oscars as the world watched.
One in particular, A R Rahman, dazzled and charmed everyone with his musical genius while also speaking sentences in Tamil.
This is America, English-only!!
And of course there were many who did not like Indians invading the Oscars:
But many Indian bloggers were tepid in acknowledging the feat of 'Slumdog Millionaire'.
We highlighted the mixed reactions of many Indians about this movie in an earlier post in Global Voices.
Many slum-dwellers in Mumbai, where the movie was shot, have protested because they were called slumdog in that movie.
Meera Sinha writes:
Despite feeling that Slumdog Millionaire shouldn’t be viewed as a defining film about Indian poverty, it’s been exciting to see India in the limelight after the movie’s 8 Oscar wins.
I’m tempted to write more, but I’ll give into the celebratory moment and avoid going into any further detail about my issues with the film.
Great Bong at Random Thoughts Of A Demented Mind was not too impressed either:
For one, Slumdog Millionaire very deliberately and very effectively strikes many of the chords that Academy judges have been known to have a soft spot for.
In order to ace an exam, you do not necessarily have to be the best —even an average person can excel if he/she can understand the “system” and do exactly what is expected.
Slumdog Millionaire does that admirably.
Hitesh Bagai wonders in a twitter message:
Lekhni at The imagined Universe tries to find "Why do Indians hate Slumdog Millionaire?"
I wonder if our main objection to the movie is because it depicts a part of India we’d rather not focus on.
We’d like to celebrate our economic growth and our resurgent middle class.
We’d like to point to our new malls and glass-fronted buildings.
The movie does not show much of the prosperity of middle class India.
It shows the other India that not many of us know very well, or would like to think about - the poor India that has remained poor despite all the recent economic growth.
Shripriya Mahesh at Tatvam (Inner Truth) loved the movie and writes:
Why on earth should any filmmaker be burdened with representing a city or a country?
He’s not making a documentary.
There’s a story to be told.
It involves a sliver of a view of a city.
From the point of view of one fictitious life.
The filmmaker’s job is to tell that story to the best of his/her ability.
And that’s exactly what Danny Boyle did.
And I for one, loved the result.
Prerna highlights India's capabilities and concluds with:
Sure, it took a British director to make a movie on an ‘Indian subject’ to get Oscars for Indian technicians who have been doing superior work for decades (i.e. Gulzar, A R Rahman, Pookutty).
Slumdog Millionaire is nowhere near the A-list of Bollywood movies given it’s simple tried-and-tested theme of love over money.
And this isn’t A R Rahman or Gulzaar’s best work.
At the same time, it is heartening to see these musical greats finally getting international recognition for what is ultimately an Indian movie.
However, THAT should not be a marker for success.
AR Rahman doesn’t need Hollywood; Hollywood needs him.
Congratulations nonetheless, to Slumdog Millionaire and to every Indian that considers this their movie.
I feel guilty writing about divorce and polygamy on Valentine’s Day.
But these two unmentionable topics are also realities of love and relationships.
In Indonesia, more women are divorcing their husbands because of polygamy.
Records show that in 2006 there were nearly 1000 cases of divorce because of husbands marrying another woman.
Polygamous marriages are also increasing - the Legal Aid Foundation of the Indonesian Women's Association for Justice received 87 reports of polygamy in 2008, up from 16 in 2007.
More women in polygamous marriages are becoming more assertive about their rights.
Abdul Khalik writing for The Jakarta Post quotes the views of scholars about this issue:
Director General for Islamic guidance at the Ministry for Religious Affairs Nasaruddin Umar: "There has been a significant increase in divorce because women have been rejecting polygamy in recent years.”
Muslim scholar Siti Musdah Mulia: “The data shows women are now daring to fight for their rights and reject male domination.
They are now saying, 'What is the point in continuing a marriage when I am miserable'"
Divorce in general has risen in Indonesia in the past decade.
A news report early this month confirmed this trend; and couples are also separating because of political differences:
The divorce rate jumped from an average of 20,000 a year to more than 200,000 a year over the decade Believe it or not, some couples decide to divorce because the husband and wife have different takes on political issues.
This has never happened before,” said Umar.
In 2005, 105 couples cited political differences as the cause of their split but this figure jumped to 502 couples in 2006.
Figures for 2007 and 2008 were yet to be calculated.
The official said 90 per cent of marriages between people of different religions ended in divorce
Indonesia Matters cites a 2007 study about the causes of divorce:
The main causes of divorce, says a report by the National Child Protection Commission (Komnas PA), are economic pressures (23%), followed by domestic squabbling (19%), incompatibilty (19%), interference by relatives (14%), violence (12%), adultery (8%), and sexual problems (3.6%).
However these figures are based on only 109 cases
A 2008 article cites the causes of divorce:
incompatibility (because of adultery) - 54000 cases
disharmony - 46000
economic hardship - 24000
interference by relatives - 9000
family crisis - 4700
forced marriage - 1700
domestic violence - 900
polygamy - 879
biological defect (like infertility) - 580
underage marriage - 284
imprisonment - 150
political differences – 157
It is difficult to be a divorcee in Indonesia.
My Busy Brain explains:
Some people, in Indonesia that is (I don’t know about other countries), divorce is not a choice.
Even if the marriage is not healthy, even if it is abusive, one choose to be still married because either cannot imagine living by themselves, too tired and just accept that this is fate , or economically dependant (usually woman).
This morning I was bombed by an email that I received from my friend from highschool, that he is not doing well and lost 7 kgs the last 3 months because he is going through divorce.
Oh my God.
Not another one.
Even though I myself is a divorcee, I don’t really like hearing people getting divorce because I know how painful it is
Parvita writes more about the stigma associated with divorced women in Indonesia:
I have no problem being divorced, it was the right thing to do at the time and I never regret it.
When people ask me where my husband is, I tell them I’m divorced.
Usually, they are the one that feel uncomfortable.
The sad thing that I would like to address here is, that after 3 years, the person I hoped and wished to be able to accept me for what I am, still cannot accept it and look at me as I am incomplete.
I am sure there are lots of women here in my country that experience that, especially from the older generation or the conservatives.
Despite of their bravery to live alone, they just stick with an unhappy marriage because afraid of what other people think, or simply because they are not independent, financially or mentally.
In Indonesia, women are considered successful not from what they have achieved, but from their husbands, how many kids they can deliver and how fat their kids are and where their kids go to school.
nin's journey was inspired by the post written by Umm Faroug about being a radical Muslim feminist:
As a radical Muslim feminist I know my rights as a wife, which are to be fed, sheltered, clothed, and cared for in a way befitting to me.
I have the right to a marriage contract which safeguards me in case of a divorce.
On a lighter note, Indosingleparent Community posts pictures of divorce cakes.
Indonesian restaurateur Puspo Wardoyo offers "polygamy juice", a mixture of four tropical fruits, and "polygamy vegetables", a four-vegetable combo, in his restaurants.

Jamaican blogger, Girl with a Purpose notes that while she does think the ban will be effective in reducing the lewd music that is heard "for probably 50% of the time...via radio and television", a large part of the responsibility lies with the adults of our society, especially parents, who need to censor themselves and realize that:
To expose their young children to lewd and explicit music, thus making them prematurely ready and aware of sex and violent acts, is wrong.
Another trend in these discussions is the issue of other musical genres besides dancehall (i.e. soca and calypso, hip hop, rap etc.), especially as Jamaica enters its Carnival season - a time when imported soca music takes centre stage across the island.
Amidst cries of hypocrisy by several Jamaican artistes who feel that dancehall is being unfairly singled out, MadBull, a Jamaican blogger in Cayman, writes that he fully supports the ban and thinks it should be extended to any genre of music being considered for public airplay.
He exclaims on his blog:
What about soca and hip hop and so on?
I don’t care what the genre is!
If the lyrics dutty, drop dem too!
That's what I think!
Outspoken Jamaican blogger, Agostinho, published on his blog a letter he submitted to the editors of various local media in which he discusses the need for dancehall to revamp its image.
While he acknowledges the place of dancehall music in Jamaican society and its importance as the centre of popular culture, he feels that dancehall has a responsibility to the society from which it springs to reform its image...
not just in the interests of practicality given its increased powers of importance in the society, but also as a means of demonstrating its inherent versatility/creativity.
The latter, as we are aware, goes beyond a focus on only themes of sex and violence.
Excuses regarding a chronic lack of education on the part of many of its producers and artistes are an insult to the diversity of intelligence and depth of talent within the industry/culture.
These must yield to the more urgent demands of true national development, cultural pride and meaningful progress.
Stunner's Afflictions also explains his thoughts on the ban.
He fully supports the move by the Broadcasting Commission, noting that it was long overdue:
It is their job to police what is good for public broadcast as prescribed by Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulations.
So why did they have to wait on public outcry and pressure for them to take a step to ban such material?
What have they been doing and what are they doing, for my hard earned taxpayer dollars?
The Broadcasting Commission need to pull up their socks and this incident really shows them up.
His followup post on Valentine's Day sought to remind readers of a crucial point:
Not all of our Dancehall/Reggae music is less than desirable.
There are still very good songs being played on our airwaves.
Since this public ban on explicit music, support has begun for more positive products to come out of the Jamaican entertainment industry.
YardFlex, tagging itself as the Ultimate Jamaican Entertainment Magazine, reported recently on Tychicus, a self-described healer and prophet who staged a one-man protest last year against "daggering", and who has since come out with some clean dances that he says are inspired by the Almighty.
This discussion is ongoing as the ban is only 10 days old and the full implementation and its effects are yet to be seen.
Jamaican bloggers have all come out in full support of the ban, and see this as a time for Jamaican artistes to step up and prove their creativity to the world.
As the number of Internet users has been growing rapidly in Southeast Asia in recent years, online censorship has proliferated, from China to Cambodia, as if it runs through the Mekong river.
Not only the "Great Firewall of China" that is known to many people, democratic country like Thailand also blocks a large number of Web sites; in Vietnam, its Ministry of Information and Communication has recently released a circular to regulate and enforce blogging rules in the country in late 2008.
With rules and regulations in place, these governments have developed and deployed their own censorship machine to control how citizens publish and access online contents.
Although Cambodia has the lowest Internet penetration rate (70,000 users as of 2007), artists, however, are more recognized not through offline exhibitions, but their presence on the world wide web.
This increasing use of blog to reach out larger audiences attracts more than attention and support.
A former freelance editorial cartoonist for Far Eastern Economic Review from 1997-1999, Bun Heang Ung presently lives in Australia.
Observing his home country Cambodia from the other side, the 57-year-old cartoonist launched Sacrava Toons blog in 2004, nearly a decade after he published 'The Murderous Revolution : Life and Death in Pol Pot's Kampuchea,' his first book of black and white line illustrations that tells his very own experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime.
In voicing his opinions, the talented cartoonist publish his drawings of all things that matter to him on the Web.
In one of his recent posts, he used 'I have a dream' as a backdrop for his illustration of Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States.
Barack Obama, illustrated by Bun Heang Ung
Recently, according to Wikileaks, the political cartoonist's blog is being blocked in Thailand, where its Ministry of Information and Communication Technology is in charge of banning Internet sites that violates its Kingdom's lèse majesté.
Cambodian blogger Thom Vanak, at Blog By Khmer, made his point on the issue:
Regarding Lèse majesté, although I think it's archaic and outdated law in this day and age, but nevertheless, it's still Thai's law.
If I ever set my foot on Thai soil I would respect their laws.
The same if I'm to visit any other country, I would respect the local laws of that country.
While the prominent cartoonist's blog appears on censorship list (as of 20 Dec 2008) by Thailand, the Cambodian Ministry of Women's Affairs, in December last year, threatened to block a Web site that contains artistic illustrations of bare-breasted Apsara dancers and a Khmer Rouge soldier.
The attempt to shut down reahu.net (or at least to filter it by Internet Service Providers in the Cambodian capital) was echoed by a human rights activist, who was quoted as saying that "the Web site should be shut down because it appealed too much to young Cambodians."
Reahu.net is currently not accessible by Internet visitors in Cambodia, while there is no issue with access in the U.S. The error message appears:
Screenshot of reahu.net site being filtered by Cambodia's Internet Service Providers
Cambodia's most prominent anonymous blog author at 'Cambodia: Details are Sketchy' wrote about the controversial issue:
"If anyone should understand the value of free speech, the deputy director of communication and advocacy at Licadho seems a likely candidate.
It is disheartening that Vann Sophath supports censoring Reahu’s illustrations"
Artist Reahu posted a note on his site, recently becoming popular after gaining media attentions in the past few months, in response to his critics:
Judging from the complaints, I wonder how we as Khmer will be able to make it in the 21st Century.
Please be open-minded, you must be able to see beyond the four walls surrounding your hut.
Carnival is a tradition, a part of every West Indian soul and the French Caribbean is no exception.
Here is a review of blogs from Martinique, French Guiana, Haiti and Guadeloupe, which highlights the features of Carnival there.
In brevesdeguyane, we learn about the kick-off of Carnival in French Guiana and discover pictures illustrating the French Guianese tradition of the “Touloulous“.
The term originally refers to small colorful earth crabs, which swiftly run and hide under the ground whenever they feel threatened.
So what is the connection with those wonderfully disguised women?
Lilie Belle in MaGuyane decribes Carnival in French Guiana and provides an answer to the question :
See our special coverage page on Madagascar's Power Struggle.
At least 25 people were shot dead today in Madagascar's capital Antananarivo during a march to the presidential palace called by the city's mayor Andry Rajoelina after he declared himself the leader of a new transitional government at a political rally.
In the past weeks, a power struggle between the mayor and the president Marc Ravalomanana has led to both violence and looting.
The political gathering took place in downtown Antananarivo around noon local time.
Rajoelina announced the creation of a new transitional government, with himself as its leader, in spite of the fact that the current government is still in place.
He asked his supporters to march to the presidential Palace in Ambohitsorohitra.
When the massive crowd arrived at the palace, a delegation entered the palace at 14:46 local time.
This is when shots were fired.
The local twittersphere and other bloggers reported:
Preliminary reports indicate that dozens of bodies are laying on the streets.
Among the casualties, is said to be a cameraman from the RTA TV station (official confirmation still pending).
As of 15:40 local time, shots were still being fired.
Rajoelina asked the armed EMMONAT forces, a military entity accepted by both parties and created during the crisis, to intervene and protect the crowds.
News releases (Reuters, Al Jazeera) report up to 25 deaths as images are currently streaming on national TV.
BBC and AFP only reported 5 casualties so far.
Live online reports can also be found in French here.
This is a live search of Twitter for "#madagascar", which is the tag people have been using throughout the past weeks of political tension and occasional violence.
The week gone has been a politically hot one for many Malawians as they have seen their presidential and parliamentary candidates present their nominations papers to the Malawi Electoral Commission ahead of the May 19 polls.
By the end of the exercise, about 8 presidential and over 500 parliamentary candidates presented their nomination papers to compete for the 193 seats in parliament.
Journalist Kondwani Munthali earlier on shared his views on the political developments which are expected to lead to the most contested at both presidential and parliamentary levels.
He writes Viva My Country's Democracy:
Yes, I said DPP has no structures to manage itself through primaries, I am glad two Ministers recalled my discussions with them and called me.
For UDF how they can managed the situation of Muluzi will be entirely to them.
For MCP it seems they have changed indeed, the guys look serious enough to upset tables.
For today thats where it ends
Another blogger under Ndagha agrees with Munthali that Malawi's politics this year is getting hotter.
He hope that its players have a genuine heart for the Malawians and not necessarily to serve their own interests.
He says that for him this year offers hope.
How and why?:
For me, the parliamentary race will the most exciting as it will showcase lots of new entrants-most of whom in my view can make important contributions to the country's development.
I wish we had popular new faces on the presidential race.
Another journalist Mzati Nkolokosa terms this political time in Malawi as a Season of Rumors.
He writes a long post focusing on Brown Mpinganjira who has dumped the party he helped to form and paired himself with John Tembo of the Malawi Congress Party as a running mate.
It is right to call this period a season of rumours.
But Brown Mpinganjira must go on to accept that crucial political truths in Malawi start as rumours.
Brown Mpinganjira, the cleverest politician in Malawi according to Jack Mapanje, is good at communication.
He knows words that are loaded with meaning, he speaks poetry, and he can confuse people, even journalists, who don’t follow him critically.
Most Malawi's public offices are not fully computerised.
While there are some efforts to improve this, it remains a challenge to most government departments and agencies.
One of the offices that serves lots of Malawians is the office of the Administrator General where among others, clients are helped with services regarding their deceased estate.
Having attended a short course on data entry, journalist Pauline Kalumikiza writes on the importance of such offices going digital:
The reason is that, it takes so long for them to help the benefiaries due to their manual storage.
I think it is laborious and time consuming, because they handle multiple of files so them to take out one, it takes ages.
Most of the times, they will tell you that ‘Sorry come next month, give us time to look for it’. Now Imagine a person is coming from Nsanje to the AG’s office in Blantyre; he comes again as per the arrangement and is told that he should wait for another week, very frustrating isn’t it?
Yes technology has its own disadvantages but I think, the AG’s office would save time and energy by going digital.
We cannot be talking of making ICT accessible to everyone, if our important offices that hold crucial information are still using manual storage system.
Zisinthe!
(Let things change!)
Martinique blogger le blog de , in another post on the ongoing workers' movement in Martinique and Guadeloupe, takes issue with Christophe Barbier, opinion editor of the French news magazine, L'Express.
In a recent interview on the radio show C dans l'air, Barbier responded to an SMS from a listener who asked, "Why don't we just grant the overseas departments their independence?"
Barbier replied:
Many people across the Middle East have decided to boycott Israeli and American products in response to the Israeli war on Gaza.
The Angry Arab News Service wrote:
Among all the American brands, Starbucks was the main target of the boycotting campaigns.
Zeinobia, from Egypt, wrote about this saying:
Starbucks, the famous Starbucks branch was closed in Beirut for a day because of the protests.
There are calls and actual respond to it across the Arab world to boycott the American products especially 84268245 those products associated with Israel in a way or another.
She then continued:
Of course the Arabic public is convinced that Starbucks in America gives annual donation to the IDF due to the fact that founder and the owner of Starbucks is a Jew, to be honest this is not enough to draw a conclusion that the chain donates to the IDF but news like that one makes the Arab public thinks twice.
Starbucks-IDF rumors are bit old rumours even before it opens its branches in Egypt ,it was fought in the Arab world.
I remember one day I received any email about the logo of Starbucks and its history , saying that it is the Hebrew Princess that saved the Jews in Babylonian ancient time where in reality it is another whole thing.
The boycotting campaigns were not limited to the Arab world only, and American-Palestinian group blog KABOBfest reported here how people in Malaysia are also participating in the campaigns:
Over 2,000 Muslim-owned restaurants in Malaysia have taken Coca-Cola off the menu in an effort to support global boycotts against Israel.
Local organizations are encouraging employees of Coca-Cola, as well as Starbucks and other companies, to quit their jobs.
From Jordan, Khobbeizeh also wrote about boycotting Starbucks:
Howard Schultz is an active Zionist, extremely sectarian for the Israeli army.
He is supporting them with hundred of millions yearly from Starbucks' income, and he's one of the major sponsors of their weaponry.
For sure, the Israeli products were boycotted by many people as well, and here is what Body on the Line wrote in her blog:
Farmers say much of their produce is being held in warehouses due to canceled orders, and fear a sharp decrease in fruit exports to countries such as Jordan, Britain, and the Scandinavian countries.
...
Ilan Eshel, director of the Organization of Fruit Growers in Israel, said Scandinavian countries have also been canceling orders.
The American blogger, who lives in Palestine, then wrote about how academics in the United Kingdom are reacting to the Israeli attack on Gaza:
British academics have written an open letter, published in the Guardian, calling for boycott, divestment, and sanctions:
"We must do what we can to stop Israel from winning its war.
Israel must accept that its security depends on justice and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors, and not upon the criminal use of force."
"We believe Israel should immediately and unconditionally end its assault on Gaza, end the occupation of the West Bank, and abandon all claims to possess or control territory beyond its 1967 borders.
We call on the British government and the British people to take all feasible steps to oblige Israel to comply with these demands, starting with a programme of boycott, divestment and sanctions."
In London students also took action in solidarity with Gaza at the prestigious London school of economics: More than 40 students were continuing their sit-in at the London School of Economics today in protest at the conflict in Gaza.
There are also organizations and sites that are dedicated to spreading word about the campaigns like this, this, and this one.
But on the other hand some others, like Crossroads Arabia were not that much into the boycotting:
Saudi Gazette reports that a boycott of American products in support of the people of Gaza is beginning to take hold in Saudi Arabia.
As with earlier, similar boycotts, this one is likely to a) assuage Saudi feelings of impotence and b) hurt the Saudi franchisees and their employees, without actually doing much damage to the US economy, contrary to what a professor from King Abdulaziz University states.
It’s clear that the idea of a boycott has strong popular support, though.
Also Jewlicious wrote a post in reply to Khobbeizeh:
Now, I’m no big fan of Starbucks, or of Coffee for that matter, but the notion that Starbucks supports the IDF to the tune of “hundred of millions yearly” is patently ludicrous.
Khobbeizeh my friend, your ample Photoshop skills aside, you are an idiot.
A French tourist was killed and around 20 people were injured when a bomb exploded outside the Al Hussein Mosque in Cairo's popular tourist area Khan Al Khalili earlier today.
And as the world was coming to grips with what was happening on the ground, Egypt's bloggers were quick at work, exchanging updates, information, analysis and concerns.
It all started when Zenobia posted a message on Twitter reporting that "There is some kind of explosion in Cafe at Al Azhar."
Minutes later Arabawy followed up with another confirming message which read: "Explosion in el-Mashhad el-Husseini Street, Cairo."
Moftasa was the first to guess a link between the bombings and a new controversial anti-terrorism law, which will be discussed within days in the Egyptian parliament.
The draft law was met by wide objections.
Nothing was confirmed yet, and rumors were circulating; however, Zeinobia was trying to gather updates from different sources Newspapers and TV channels in a quick but comprehensive roundup.
The Arabist, who was near the area and heard both explosions himself, wrote:
Am hearing reports of a bomb going off in the medieval part of Cairo near Khan al-Khalili, a major tourist destination.
Will update as more news is available.
Update: Al Jazeera reporting 11 deaths, three Egyptians, three Germans, one French, 16 wounded, one french dead these and others remain to be confirmed.
Update 2: Already activists are saying this is conveniently close to next month when the Emergency Law is to be discussed in parliament… Update 3: Four dead (German and French), 12 wounded, various nationalities.
moftasa then posts a link to a photograph from the blast area on Twitter.
And while Msfour, and American expat living in Cairo, was the first to ask bloggers on Twitter to use the tag #cairobomb, Arabawy was the first to ask bloggers to use a unified delicious tag: El-HusseinExplosion to pool all links under the same URL.
Yassary Masry , Carl, Msfour, Maree, Rob, SandMonkey and Grey wool Knickers were among the first to blog about the incident, whether to comfort their friends and families or to discuss if they think there is a connection between the bombings and the anti-terrorism law or not.
Grey wool Knickers wrote a short note connecting the last events happening in Egypt, trying to relate them to the recent bombings:
As several people have noted, this comes at a very suspicious time, considering that the extension of the State of Emergency (in place since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, with a brief break during Sadat’s presidency) was just about to be considered once again.
Mubarak’s government has been promising for years to come forth with an anti-terrorism law to replace martial law, which would at least give citizens some protection under Egypt’s constitution.
The regime is currently able to invoke the Emergency Law to do whatever it wants, which is what readers here will recognize in the abuction of Philip Rizk and Diaa Gad, among many others.
With the changes afoot in US and Israeli administrations—along with increasingly vocal, powerful and interconnected resistance groups, domestically and across the border in Gaza—it seems the aging Mubarak regime is getting nervous and finds little option to maintain its grip on power but to resort to a strategy of tension.
I think the recent release of celebrated political prisoner Ayman Nour should be considered as evidence of the panic roiling the upper echelons of this dictatorship.
For developing news on this event, check this delicious feed.
Until the writing of this post it has been confirmed that a 21-year-old French girl was killed, and around 20 people of different nationalities were injured.
However, it still seems to be pretty early to jump into conclusions about who is responsible for the blast.
Pictures can be found on Ahmed AbdelFatah's blog and readers can follow Egyptian bloggers on Twitter here.
It is a common story across Latin America, where emigrants set off to find greener pastures in neighboring or distant countries.
It is no different for Paraguayans, who leave behind friends and family for other opportunities, whether in other South American countries or across the ocean in Europe.
Some of these stories are now being told using citizen media.
A blog called Somos Paraguayos (We Are Paraguayans) invites immigrants across the globe to submit their firsthand stories about their experiences and the response from other Paraguayans in the comments sections add to the conversation.
Many of the stories are filled with heartache about trying to adapt to a new land, and other stories are ones of success.
The common theme among many of these stories is a search for better economic opportunities.
Gabriela writes about her 30 years in Argentina having left Paraguay behind in order to help her parents earn money.
However, leaving behind her country was not an easy task :
After a long absence, a number of fascinating Sudanese bloggers, return to the blogosphere to rant, share their thoughts on recent events and vent.
They're included in this roundup along with the usual suspects.
After a frustrated rant about Khartoum International Airport's unhygienic condition, Sudanese Optimist mourned the passing of the respected and well-known Sudanese novelist, Al-Tayeb Saleh.
Sudan has lost a dear citizen, who has contributed tremendously to Sudanese and Arabic literature.
His most acclaimed work is the 1966 novel “Season of Migration to the North.”
The novel was, at one point, banned in Sudan for its inclusion of sexual imagery, yet it was declared “the most important Arabic novel of the 20th century” by the Syrian-based Arab Literary Academy in Damascus.
Earlier this year, The General Union for Sudanese Writers, requested Al Tayeb Saleh to be preliminarily nominated to win the 2009 Literature Noble Prize.
Ras Babi Babiker mourned Saleh's passing too by reminding us about the great novel that made him a major name in the world of modern Arabic literature.
Season of Migration to the North (Arabic: موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال Mawsim al-Hiǧra ilā ash-Shamāl ) is a classic post-colonial Sudanese novel by the late novelist Al-Tayyib Salih.
Originally published in Arabic in 1966, it has since been translated into English and French.
The novel charts individuation of the (un-named) narrator, who has returned to his native village in the Sudan having spent seven years in England furthering his education.
On his arrival home, he encounters a new villager ("Mustafa Sa'eed") who exhibits none of the adulation for his achievements that most others do, and displays an antagonistically aloof nature.
The villager betrays his past one drunken evening by wistfully reciting poetry in fluent English, leaving the narrator resolute to discover the stranger's identity.
As it turns out Mustafa was also a precocious student educated in the west but simultaneously harbors a violently hateful and complex relationship with his western identity and acquaintances.
The story of Mustafa's troubled past in Europe and in particular his love affair with a British woman, forms the center of the novel.
Meanwhile, as Drima mourned along with his fellow bloggers the death of his country's great novelist, he also blogged an in-depth analysis on the possible consequences of an ICC arrest warrant charging his country's president with crimes against humanity and genocide.
the ICC can’t do much on its own in terms of enforcing the arrest warrant (if it issues it at all) and the UN is a fangless paper tiger, but…
… given that we now have Susan Rice as the US Ambassador to the UN, Hillary as Secretary of State (she has her own blog now by the way), and a Blue Donkey administration in charge of running things, US policies towards Sudan will gradually become starkly different than they were just a few months ago when Bush was still in power.
An ICC arrest warrant issued within this new context will now have more weight, and hence its potential issuance will probably be more useful as a tool for pressuring Omar al-Bashir to act in favor of peace in Darfur and implementing the CPA.
Mimz, who returned to the blogosphere after a long absence, also recently mentioned the ICC arrest warrant and her adventures with Facebook.
“Dang!” doesn’t even begin to describe it.
It’s been almost a year and a half since I was last here.
And a lot of things went down during that time.
Here are just a few highlights:
1
I joined facebook.
2
There’s a global economic crisis going on and it’s on the rise.
3
Obama was elected president of the United States.
4
Israeli troops attacked Ghaza killing and injuring hundreds.
5
The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Omer El-Bashir on charges of war crimes.
6
I graduated.
7
Sami El-Haj was released from Guantanamo Bay. (I obviously have a lot of editing to do).
8
Gillian Gibbons was arrested for a “teddy bear blasphemy case” in Khartoum.
9
The rebels reached Khartoum and attacked everyone.
10
I quit facebook. Did I mention that I finally graduated?
Hipster, a Sudanese blogger living in the UAE, is now also back actively blogging again.
She shares with us a little "Che Guevara" experience she had while driving to work.
Aggravated at the abrupt interruption, I glared at the monstrous vehicle, only to be completely amazed and amused at the sight of the colors and words adorning the spare tire case.
Che Guevara’s renowned & symbolic raggedy face picture was sandwiched between words in bold letters namely “T.N.T” and “ Al Maafia”.
I couldn’t help but look down at my paperback copy of “The Young Che: Memories of Che Guevara”, lying on the passenger’s seat, triggering me to ponder and wonder upon the mockery this revolutionary has become.
With my humble knowledge, I ask: What do “T.N.T” and “Mafia” have anything to do with the Soldier of the Americas?
And if you've ever wondered whether blogging is a form of therapy, you're not alone.
Path2Hope shares those thoughts too.
And then it happened, the dam that was blocking my ability from putting down thoughts onto paper broke and everything wanted to come pouring out instantly.
So much to write about, so many experiences to relate and then you sit infront of the laptop and wonder - who the heck cares?
Everyone has their own battle that they are tackling - and well I suppose blogging really is a form of therapy and an excuse to self indulge.
As for JohnAckec, he reminded us today of the increasingly sad situation with education in Sudan.
With more than 30 universities in Sudan and with talk of declining academic standards and rising level of unemployment amongst university graduates in our country, one is led to believe that university education has lost its glitter and is now next to worthless.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
On a happier note, Precious, wished everyone a Happy Valentine's Day.
Although I no longer beleive in romance and that passionate love I used to dream of, and although I no longer trust a man's fake "I love you"s, but you might still have a little hope.
So anyway, I deeply and sincerely wish you a very Happy Valentines day, whether you are Single, dating, engaged or married.
Enjoy the day and dont let anyone not even him/her, ruin it for you!
According to a poll carried out last month, Ukraine's president Victor Yushchenko "would have won less than 2.9% of the vote if the presidential elections were held in late December 2008 or early January 2009."
Among reasons for such low approval ratings is "the relentless infighting" between the president and PM Yulia Tymoshenko.
On Feb. 5, Tymoshenko's cabinet survived a no-confidence vote in parliament: the motion won 203 votes in the 450-seat assembly; a minimum of 226 votes is required for a motion to pass.
LEvko of Foreign Notes wrote this about the implications of the vote for the president and his political allies:
Only 10 deputies supported a -sponsored no confidence motion in the Tymoshenko-led government in the Ukrainian parliament today.
Amongst the 10 were presidential secretariat head Viktor Baloha's 'Yedyniy Tsentr' group, and Yushchenko's brother Petro.
The numbers are very bad news for the president.
The pro-presidential NUNS entered the current parliament with 72 deputies in Autumn 2007.
With an ever-receding power base, the chances of a second presidential term for Yushchenko are almost nil.
Also on Feb. 5, LJ user kotyhoroshko wrote this (UKR) about the president:
A way out for the country
Yushchenko now has a historically ideal opportunity to resign.
His resignation will partly solve the political crisis.
He will avoid the unnecessary trouble related to the election campaign.
He will not drown in the .
Perhaps, in some 20 years, he will be remembered as not the worst president.
People's memory is short.
Below are some of the comments to this post (UKR):
marmuletka:
Unfortunately, Yushchenko isn't reading your LJ .

ukrainietis:
He will be idolized again not in 20 years but in two or three years.
Because those who will replace him will most likely be ...
***
gonchar73:
The problem is that Yushchenko's orbit is comprised of those who are profiteering from their proximity to the president.
It's them who are holding him by the throat, singing panegyrics to him and are assuring him with foam at their mouths that hasn't fulfilled his mission yet.
And this is why Yushchenko's circle will not allow this to happen.
But I agree - it's a very good time to at least declare this: "I'm not going to run for a second term and I will not create obstacles for the government until the end of this term.
But from now on, all responsibility for the state of things is exclusively on ."

irishhighlander: The best option is this: let these non-traditionally gifted people collectively lead the country to default.
And then leave.
All of them - Yushchenko, and Tymoshenko, and , and the whole .
And even better - a collective hara-kiri.

Pope Benedict XVI is visiting Cameroon from 17 to 20 March 2009.
This has led the government to take some radical clean-up measures as described by Griet,Thorsten, Jara and Lisa blog:
1 All small shops, houses, vendor's stalls that don't look nice enough are being destroyed with a large caterpillar.
The truck comes by, looks at your stall/house/whatever and if the driver doesn't like, he just destroys it with all its content.
It all started about a week ago in the city centre.
Suddenly the streets did not house streetvendors anymore, all the local shops at the post office disappeared etc.
Now it's been extended all the way to the airport.
2 The road to the airport has brand new streetlights.
But then ONLY the way from the airport to the town centre.
3 Tuesday (for sure, other days to be confirmed) the road between airport and town centre will be blocked.
Note: the pope arrives in the evening, but the road needs to be blocked from EARLY MORNING.
Hence nobody can get to/from work, school etc.
This post also links to another blog by an expertriate family Sander Elke en Milan that has has photos of the destruction to roadside shops in the streets of Yaounde.
This demolition has sparked a debate on the blogs of two expatriates in Cameroon.
Συγκακοπαθησον a blog maintained by a missionary in Cameroon posted on the changes to the outlook of Yaounde as a aresult of the Pope's coming.
So what’s my take on the whole thing?
It’s nice that the city is getting a face-lift - it sure makes things look a lot nicer, and the big street lights make driving at night or trying to get a taxi along the main route so much easier and safer - but it’s sad that this clean-up has to mean the destruction of people’s way of life.
Unfortunately, these people were simply ignorant of the “rules,” some willfully so, and are now facing the consequences.
The sad part is that it seems the government was content to just let things be (possibly for as long as 10 years or longer) until something big came up, like the Pope’s arrival.
If they had taken these structures down as soon as they went up, there wouldn’t be this kind of destruction of people’s livelihood now.
Then again, I guess the law is still the law even when it’s not enforced.
This point of view wasn't really shared by British-born VSO volunteer blogging at Our Man in Cameroon.
His reaction in a post entitled Impossible Missionary was simple:
Street stalls are a way of life here.
They are everywhere.
It’s easy just to say they are illegal but they can be pretty solid structures.
What’s more, if they are illegal I’d imagine that they have only been allowed to remain because someone, somewhere is taking a regular few thousands Francs in bribes.
People here struggle.
You can bet these structures don’t turn over much and in a country where enterprise and entrepreneurship is so minimal…well what a way to reward it.I ask you, if you are in general agreement with what I have written and also find the missionary’s take as ignorant as I do, to leave a comment.
Not below but instead on the missionaries own blog.
However, readers still commented on this story on the Our Man in Cameroon blog.
The reactions got to a point that, Karis, the wife of the missionary stepped-up in defence of her husband:
I never knew my husband could cause such a stir.
I think sometimes we think that only people that know us read our blogs and those people know how to take what we write instead of tearing it apart line by line without knowing us at all.
Trav, thanks for putting in a good word.
Dad A, thanks for the humor.
You always put a smile on my face.
I just wish all of you that commented here and on his blog knew my husband — you wouldn’t be so harsh as you pull apart sentences.
He and I have had many conversations about how horrible it is that people’s livelihood is taken away from them and all for a few days visit from the Pope.
When we were in town on Monday and saw stuff being thrown into trucks, it made me sick to my stomach.
More than once, we said, “But how are people going to eat tonight? and the next day and the next day?”
It goes even beyond that in…
And then today, I saw him helping people move their sewing machines, their tables, their bags of stuff farther down on our road as the government came through with the bulldozer.
No, that was not emphasized enough in this post to show all of our conversations and actions, but wow… that doesn’t mean that my husband doesn’t feel for the people here!
Maybe I can convince him to write another post, but I’m not sure because it may be best just to leave this rather than getting things torn apart again.
I’d better just stop.
A wife sticking up for her wonderful husband isn’t much of a mind changer.
The exchanges did not end at that.
This Papal visit has quite some twists to it on the blogoshpere!
The visit of the head of the Roman Catholic Church to Cameroon this March 2009 has ignited some Cameroonian bloggers to point the search lights on the political effects (if any) of a Papal visit to country like this.
Neba Fuh blogging at Voice of the Oppressed is one of them:
Two times before, Late Pope John Paul II visited The Cameroons and the effect on the already impoverished populace was nothing more than a religious euphoria at the expense of their personal financial contributions and the public treasury.
The unanswered questions of the Biya's repressive acts were still unanswered.
Aloysius Agendia, a journalist and ex-seminarian in a post entitled Pope Benedict XVI visit to AFRICA : Going beyond spiritual rhetoric seems to suggest that the Church should denounce acts by states and politicains that harm the people's interest instead of being clothed in diplomatic robes:
We understand the Church and the Vatican as a state, and as a religious body, though with political connotations, sometimes has to be diplomatic in its approach.
In my opinion, true religion must not be indifferent to injustices, oppression, exploitation, colonialism in all its forms and other vices.
The Catholic Church has done much and is still doing a lot but a lot more still has to be done.However, diplomacy though good in its own ways, must not be of too common usage in the Church because, a spade must be called a spade.
In trying to always use "subtle" means to explain burning issues, the message is either lost or the meaning/importance, seriously minimized.
Church leaders must not choose to dine only with those in power, the rich, and the powerful.
They must not necessarily be with the opposition, but, they should stand beside the weak, the oppressed, the sick etc.
He is clear about what he expects from the Pope:
As a spiritual leader who represents hope, he must not only tell us to just keep waiting and hoping.
We expect him to be courageous enough to tell those thwarting the hope of Cameroonians and Africans to at least, have some feelings for human beings and or their fellow citizens.
On the other hand, Voice of the Oppressed wonders if the clergy particularly in Cameroon has the moral high ground to demand change from those who govern the country when they themselves are not shinning examples:
What lessons can an already morally impoverished society learn from a bishop or priest who fathers children haphazardly in his community?
What lessons can that society learn from a priest who has numerous 'girlfriends' in his community, under the excuse that he is only as human as everybody else?
Or sponsored a girlfriend's trip abroad, away from his community, so she can bear him kids, and when he takes his vacation or study leave, he's welcome abroad by 'his wife' and 'children'?
Or a Principal of a school,who is a priest, who embezzles school money through fake bills and accounting?
Or priests that have become predators to vulnerable children put at their disposal?
To Aloysius Agendia should Pope Benedict XVI of the perceived waywardness of Catholic prelates in Cameroon:
As the Holy Father visits Cameroon and Africa , he should note this.
First and foremost, the Catholic Church and most of its (shepherds) in Cameroon in particular, need serious "redressing" or "overhauling”.
The numerous stories about promiscuity, extravagance and gallivanting attitudes of some of our priests including some bishops, some even go as far as bearing children, others fornicating with their students, peoples’ wives, parishioners etc must be addressed...
This blogger belives if these issues of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church in Cameroon are not handled by the Pope then the visit would have no meaning to him:
Mortgaging the Church and its assets for “loans”, as if to sell Jesus Christ again for FCFA 950.000. 000 as Judas did for 30 pieces of silver.
Tis follows using a famous Cathedral in Cameroon as a security for a loan taken by one of its bishop.
The serious and terrifying cases of embezzlement among others, merit papal attention.
These are issues which if the Pope fails to address even in private with his priests, then his mission to Cameroon, I must admit, must have fallen far belowexpectations, and why not, a non-starter.
Will the Pope dare?
That may be the next point of interest of the Cameroonian blogosphere.

There is a final push by political parties contesting the upcoming elections in South Africa.
In particular, the ruling party the ANC (African National Congress) held a debate via twitter today.
Interestingly, the political parties have begun to make use of Social Media and social networks to get their message across.
The most prominent party making use of these techniques has been the DA (Democratic Alliance) whose campaign seems to have been inspired by President Obama's election campaign last year.
The DA have been managing a presence on social networks and several twitter accounts such as that of the mayor of Cape town and head of the DA, Helen Zille.
However, today the ANC announced on a newly created twitter account "ANC_DEBATE" that they would be hosting a live debate with questions fielded by Jessie Duarte, an anti apartheid activist and current spokesperson for the ANC.
After the announcement there was some debate on the usefulness of this.
A South African twitter user @woganmay even created a special page on twittersa, to aggregate all the comments.
Some reactions to the debate however were negative and the ANC took criticism.
For example, Jason felt that all of this was too late.
while Naeem felt that the amount of South African voters that are on twitter constitute a very small minority.
The ANC_Debate account saw a flood of questions directed towards it, and some of the responses are summarized below.
@Saulkza: Let's talk economy: What are you going to do to stop a local recession?
What about unemployment?
@ANC_debate: A massive public investment in infrastructure will stimulate economic activity, increased public works, support to key sectors.
@nikzaz: what will you do about crime in south africa?
@ANC_debate: Overhaul criminal justice system - better coordination, modernise systems, more resources.
Organise communities and deal with causes.
@shaynekrige: What in your opinion was the ANC's biggest mistake over the last 15 years? @ANC_debate: Not so much a mistake, but not enough effort put into involving people in govt and in decisions about their lives.
This comment interesting, as it begs the question: Are we going to see an overhaul of the current ANC, a new way of including people in government decisions?
Maybe government 2.0?
They also responded to comments and fears of censorship of the press
@jasdonwar: What do you have to say against allegations that South Africa's media will be curtailed by the government after the election? @ANC_debate: That's a scare tactic.
ANC fought for media freedom and there's nothing to suggest we would undermine it.
On the issue of censorship of satirical cartoonists
@JeremyTNel: Do you believe that cartoonists are too irreverent?
Would the ANC like to regulate satire? @ANC_debate: Cartoonists are supposed to be irreverent.
Satire is important.
But they should adhere to same code of ethics as any other journalist.
On questions of power and sustainability
@flintza: Again. How do you plan to meet SA power needs while limiting our carbon footprint.
Focus seems to be coal (short sighted) @ANC_debate: SA needs to move away from coal but likely to remain major source of energy for foreseeable future.
Increasing investment in nuclear, solar and wind power.
On questions of Jacob Zuma the presidential candidate being in the dock for corruption charges
@ANC_debate: All are equal before the law and have a right to be presumed innocent.
On AIDS prevention strategy
@ANC_Debate: Focus on prevention, encourage condom use and responsible behaviour.
Expand ART to cover all who need it.
Strengthen p/ships across society
@irenebarnard: How will you keep the public informed about the status of your full HIV “aggressive prevention campaign”? @ANC_debate: People need to be involved in implementation through local health facilities, NGOs, govt izimbizo in addition to traditional media.
For further coverage of the debate, visit Capetownalive which also has a summary of some of the questions.
Some users reported that they had been blocked or ignored however Jessie responded that no users had been blocked, they did however acknowledge that not all questions were answered.
I responded on my blog, that even though this debate is coming at a very late stage and only engages with users on twitter, it is however a major step in the right direction for the ANC as it gives people direct access to the party.
If something similar could be rolled out nationwide allowing people with just a mobile phone to post questions and receive responses from party candidates this could prove very useful in engaging all South Africans.
This year, the Iranian new year started with a surprising message from the US President Barak Obama, directed to the Iranian people and, for the first time, to the Islamic Republic leaders, in which he called for a new start between the two countries.
Several bloggers have reacted to this message, and some see a new era beyond the 30 years of hassles and haggles between the two States.
Mohammad Ali Abtahi, former Iranian vice president, considers Obama's message very important and says:
using the title of Islamic republic of Iran, also congratulation to the Iran's nation and leaders.
Undoubtedly it is a historical opportunity.
We can not ignore the importance of USA for Iran's current situation.
Undoubtedly we can not ignore trace of US leaders in all of Iran's dossiers also at least in economical aspect by embargos which have imposed to Iran's nation.
Sending message for congratulation can be the most important political, economical and historical opportunity, today and after changing American government.
Also ignoring that can make a situation for us more dangerous than Bush's term because Obama can mobilize political leaders and public opinion against Iran.
Blogger and journalist Masih Alinejad writes about why Iranian National TV did not broadcast Obama’s message.
She adds:
if Obama had talked as Bush and considered Iran a threat, Iranian National TV would broadcast several times.
The blogger reminds that Bush’s famous speech when he called Iran a member of axis of evil was broadcasted several times in National TV.
Zandegieh Sagi calls Obama’s message very positive and something that the Iranian people deserve.
The blogger says that the first thing the Iranian government can do is to use appropriate political language.
In View from Iran, we read:
There are a lot of measures that the US government can take to build trust.
Not all of those have to do with the Iranian government’s willingness to start dialogue with the US.
I see Obama’s New Year message as positive, but we need more than that.
Mmoeeni writes that while the Iranian TV did not broadcast the news about Obama's message, the Iranian president was able to insult the American leaders in the USA.
The blogger adds, with a pinch of irony, that Ahmadinejad then says there is absolute freedom in Iran.
New Year Holidays
Iranians celebrated Norouz (Nowruz) on the first day of spring as the traditional Iranian new year holidays.
On this occasion, some Iranians throw flowers on the tomb of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the first Persian Empire in Pasargad (photo above).
The Save Pasargad website says that the Islamic Republic authorities did not provide any comfort for visitors in this historic place, but in recent years more people have come to celebrate the new year in Pasargad.
The Congolese blogosphere had harsh criticism for Congolese president Joseph Kabila's recent interview in The New York Times.
In it, Kabila talks about Rwanda, AFRICOM, Chinese investment, and his passion for motorcycles.
He also talked about how good help is hard to find; many bloggers have blasted him for it.
Kabila blames corruption on Mobutu's legacy and the ineptitude of his own officials, rather than taking responsibility for his government's problems:
Q: Do you have the right people to help you?
A: (Long pause) Mobutu led this country for over 37 years.
He created a political class and he created a mentality and we haven't done away with that.
The old ways are bad - corruption, misrule, mismanagement and all that.
Our biggest mistake is that we have not found enough time to train and form our own cadres.
You don't need a thousand people to transform a country.
No, you need 3,4, 10, 15 people with the necessary convictions, determined and resolute.
Do I have those 15 people?
Probably 5, 6, 7, not yet 15.
On Forum Réalisance Musengeshi Katata writes that Joseph Kabila he has injured every Congolese who had read the interview:
“What are Rwanda's interests in the Congo?
I like to believe that they are the same.
But if there is a hidden agenda, and Rwanda's interest is more or less controlling the mining concessions and all that, illegally, and if they have a hand in each and everything that goes on in North and South Kivu, then we're still a long way from trust.
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, once again, probably for the last time”
The Mushaki Pager wonders what made Kabila take such a strong stance:
Salman Khan (center), a Bollywood super star, campaigns in support of Congress party candidate Milind Deora at a rally in Mumbai Photo by Al Jazeera English and used under a creative commons license.
In India movie stars and filmmakers wield enormous influence and that point was drawn dramatically by Danny Boyle in the movie Slumdog Millionaire (hint: it is the toilet scene).
Interestingly, the entertainment industry's (especially Bollywood or the Hindi film industry based in Mumbai) involvement in Indian politics was pretty marginal with a few a actors and some film makers participating in the election campaign process. But, there was an exception.
The Southern state of Tamil Nadu, which is the first state in the world to effectively harness and use the film medium for political purposes right from the 1940s.
During the late 1960s this nexus between politicians and the Tamil film industry reaped handsome dividends for Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and led to the formation of the first non-Congress government in the state.
Since then various offshoots of DMK party have alternately been in power in Tamil Nadu.
By the 1980s there was a steady trickle of entertainers into the political arena.
In some cases they successfully contested and formed governments (like NTR and his Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh) or were voted/nominated to the Indian Parliament.
Fast forward to 2009 and the involvement of entertainers from Bollywood (or the Hindi film industry) based in Mumbai and the Tamil and Telugu film industry have registered a significant spike in the election campaign.
Telugu actor Chiranjeevi launched a new political party in Andhra Pradesh, while Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt failed to get nominated because of his criminal record in the 1993 Mumbai blast.
In Tamil Nadu former actress and Chief Minister Jayalalitha is in the running after being defeated in the previous elections.
But, it is the involvement of Bollywood folks that has captured peoples' imagination.
Bollywood actor cum blogger Amitabh Bachchan offers a glimpse of his thoughts on the upcoming Indian elections.
He writes:
"The elections are upon us.
Elections in the largest and most thriving democracy in the world.
TV has nothing else to offer but the electoral scenario unfolding upon us.
Exit polls and analysis and who will win from where and who said what to whom and why.
Even the media questionnaires that come across to us are full of queries on politics.
Friends have become foes, foes have become friends. Games and manipulations all parties play to come to power.
To win for the next 5 years and remain in governance.
To them politics is an aphrodisiac, an elixir, that compels them to perform."
Bachchan's wife Jaya Bachchan has been active politically for a few years now.
What could be the driving force that has prompted so many Bollywood actors to step out of their comfort zone and do their bit for this Indian election campaign?
Gaurav Shukla of India Election 2009 might have unearthed the answer to that question.
He writes:
"Celebrities who used to keep politics at an arms length have surprisingly chosen to rally around the need to vote this time.
Industry experts suggest that the Mumbai terror attacks in November last year may be the reason for this change...Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, John Abraham, Kamal Haasan, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Anurag Kashyap, Shriya Sharan, Shruti Haasan and Sushmita Sen are among those who have joined the chorus."
Bollywood actor Aamir Khan helped launch a voter awareness campaign for Association of Democratic reforms with the tagline: "Sachche ko chune, Achche ko chune” — meaning “vote for the honest, vote for good people.”
Besides being the face and voice of the voter awareness campaign, Khan went one step further and helped produce the videos and audio pieces.
AamirKhanblog writes:
"The ads have been made by the actor’s production company, Aamir Khan Productions, free of cost.
An ‘A’ list Bollywood ensemble has put together this campaign.
The creative head is Prasoon Joshi of McCann Erickson, Rakyesh Mehra is the director, Avinash Gowarikar the still photographer, and Shashi Sinha of Lodestar Media the media planner for the campaign.
Everybody is working for the campaign gratis.
The ad campaign is being aired in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese and Oriya so that it can reach out to the masses."
Aamir Khan, who is also a blogger reminds Indian voters to make an informed choice when they cast their post.
He wrote in his blog post:
To all Indians, remember to vote, and make an informed choice.
Meaning, check out all the candidates from your area before you decide who to vote for.
Khan is vacationing in Montana, but according to media reports will fly back to Mumbai and cast his vote on April 30th, the day the commercial and entertainment capital of India goes to the polls.
Besides Khan, a whole slew of Bollywood actors and filmmakers have volunteered their time for various election mobilization and awarness programs.
Perhaps, the most significant one is the involvement of the entertainment industry in the non-profit organization called Jaagore (that translates to "Wake up").
The NGO has created powerful short video clips like this one where Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor points out that average age an Indian is 23 years old, while the average age of a a cabinet minister in the Federal Governmnet is 62 years old.
Or, watch this video clip by Bollywood film director Rakeysh Omprakash, where he points out that in the state of Rajasthan a politician won the elections by one vote.
This post is part of the Global Voices special coverage on Indian Elections 2009
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo recently admitted that he is the father of Viviana Carillo's son, who was conceived when Lugo was still a Roman Catholic bishop.
He also acknowledged a long-time secret relationship with Carillo.
Now this news is causing quite a stir amongst politicians, the media, and bloggers who write about the disappointment in their current leader, but also how there are much more serious problems to worry about and the comparison to other acts committed by politicians.

Carlos Rodríguez of Rescatar makes a comparison with what happened years ago in the United States, when then-President Bill Clinton had an inappropriate and extra-marital relationship with Monica Lewinski.
There are some who say that it was a personal and private relationship that did not affect the country's interests or did not have any consequences in the lives of the American citizens.
Now that Lugo has come forward and will accept responsibility, he writes that the issue is closed for the Paraguayan people .
He adds that there are more serious acts committed by other politicians that should receive more ire from the Paraguayan citizens, and that the press should return to focusing on the "national agenda."
However, since Paraguay is a predominantly Catholic country, many are disappointed in the fact that Lugo violated the clerical vows of celibacy, but to some self-described atheists like Liam of Políticamente Incorrecto , that is a non-issue.
He also examines the reaction by many different sectors to this piece of news both nationally and internationally:
Today marks the end of a week of national mourning in Rwanda to mark 15 years since the genocide which killed 800,000 people.
On the 7th of April ceremonies were held in the capital Kigali, and in Nyanza, where more than 5,000 people were slaughtered.
At a stadium in Kigali, thousands of candles spelt out the word "hope" in three languages.
Rwandan blogger Negrita's Chronicles asked her readers to join the nation-wide candlelight vigil for the victims through her blog:
It has been 15 years since the Genocide forever changed my home and my people.
The world stood silent as cries for help went unheeded.
Please join us in lighting a candle in memory of those whose lives were taken and in hope for a future of peace, justice, and true reconciliation.
In succesive posts, Negrita posted a video for the campaign Candles for Rwanda, and the song 'Never Again' written and recorded in commemoration of the Genocide.
The song was composed by Rwanda's gospel singer Jean Paul Samputu in Kinyanrwanda, but its choruses are sung in different languages (English, French, Swahili, Kirundi and Kiganda) by various popular regional musicians.

Martin Leach, the head of the DFID (British Department for International Development) in Rwanda attended the ceremonies in Nyanza, which he describes in his blog:
Hundreds of people trudged up the long hill to Nyanza, many of them wearing something purple, a neckscarf, a wrap, even a purple wristband.
The colour purple is the colour of mourning in Rwanda and yesterday, 7th April, was the 15th Anniversary of the Genocide.
At the top of the hill I joined the large crowd at the Commemoration Ceremony.
Wedged between two ambassadors, I heard heart breaking accounts from survivors of the massacre which took place on the site where we were seated, with no one to protect them against the brutal attacks of the militia.
But it was the young people who moved me most: girls dressed in purple and white reciting poems in Kinyarwandan about the need to take courage for the future in spite of the sorrow and grief, and a youth choir with 'Never Again' emblazoned on their T-shirts and headbands, singing with emotion about the importance of never forgetting the genocide.
And it was emotional. Even the Government Ministers were shedding tears, remembering their experiences and lost loved ones.
I can't imagine it - one million people killed in 100 days: as the Lady Mayor of Kigali said 'an unspeakable evil' had gripped the country.
Michael Abramowitz of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum was in Kigali for the ceremonies.
In the blog World is Witness, Abramovitz recounts the testimony of a genocide survivor called Venuste that moved the audience with his story during the ceremony:
Venuste, who looked to be in his 50s or 60s, with a dignified bearing, proceeded to tell the hushed crowd how his family and neighbors decided to take refuge at the nearby L’Ecole Technique Officielle, thinking that might be a safe refuge because of the small contingent of Belgian United Nations soldiers stationed there.
But four days later, to their great shock, the small U.N. force departed, telling those gathered on the school grounds that “gendarmes” would rescue them.
The U.N. soldiers ignored their desperate pleas not to leave them at the mercy of a menacing crowd of government soldiers and armed militia that surrounded them outside the gates of the school.
After the departure of the last U.N. soldier, Venuste and some 5,000 others who were gathered on the school grounds were forced to walk a jeering gauntlet of Hutu militiamen, soldiers and civilians wielding machetes, guns and other weapons.
Some of those who survived described it as a “death walk.”
Venuste lost his right arm, hacked off by one of the tormentors.
The walkers came to this unremarkable hill, where they were encircled by a gang of killers and set upon with grenades, machetes and clubs.
Within a few hours, Venuste said, “We were lying in pools of blood.”
Of the 5,000 or so who sought refuge from the U.N. near here, roughly 100 survived, according to Venuste.
He lived only because he laid still under dead bodies, overlooked by the killers searching the carnage for signs of life.
Impressed by the economic development of Rwanda, Abramowitz sees no traces of the atrocities experienced 15 years ago:
As I first-time visitor to Rwanda, it’s hard not to be mystified by the mismatch between the ferocious events of just 15 years ago and apparent calm and prosperity in Rwanda, which aspires to be the hub of an economically vibrant East Africa.
As we drove out of town to one of the churches where you can still see the skulls and belongings of murdered Tutsi, we passed by workers digging up ditches on the side of the road to lay down new fiber optic lines.
A newcomer thinks: How can this beautiful country, routinely described by Africa hands as one of the better functioning countries on the continent, have experienced such savagery?

Colette Braeckman , a Belgian journalist and author of several books about Central Africa, was also present at the anniversary ceremony in Kigali of which she writes:
This post is part of the Global Voices Special Coverage on Indian Elections 2009
World’s largest democracy, India, will hold general elections starting in a few weeks from now.
In a country of more than a billion people, general election is nothing sort of a “make or break” time for many interest groups, political parties and the common folk.
For how their life will be for next five years is decided on that day.

Indian women, who have long been denied their rightful position at home, at work and at the helm of power also have a huge stake in upcoming elections.
Female literacy in the country (based on 2001 census) is at 53.63% compared to 75.26% for male, but Indian women are not completely shut off from the political process.
Level of their participation is increasing and a some prominent parties have women as leaders.
Although more and more women are becoming aware of their voting rights and participating at local level politics, a report suggests that this year less women are likely to be elected to the country’s parliament.
“The introduction of the Women’s Reservations Bill in 14th Lok Sabha has prompted more women asking for tickets from major parties this time, but the selection of candidates by the latter reveals that electoral politics in India still remains a male preserve.
Including party Chief Sonia Gandhi, only nine women figure in the list of 90-and odd Lok Sabha candidates announced by the Congress so far and the BJP list of 232 candidates, contains only 21 women.
The Left Front, which has accused both the BJP and the Congress of lacking political will on the women’s reservation bill, has fielded only two women out of 42 candidates in its bastion West Bengal, down from five it had fielded in 2004 elections.”
Samiya Anwar, a female voter, writes about upcoming elections focusing on her hometown of Hyderabad:
“There are more women issues than men to be addressed.
Isn’t it?
First, it is the safety of women in society she dwells in.
Many women in the Old City (of Hyderabad) do not trust police.
They go through domestic and physical violence and don’t complain.
We need a system where women can approach cops fearlessly.
The issues like water shortage, frequent power cuts, road accidents and physical abuse of women at workplace should be given first thought.”
Question of caste is a big one during election time in India.
As someone said “Indians don’t caste their vote but vote their caste”, the politics of dividing people based on their caste and exploiting them as “vote banks” is a common practice.
Joshua Meah blogging about caste system and of women in Indian politics at Washington Note says:
“India n. (perhaps it has potential as an adjective as well?): the land where the opposite of everything is always at least a little bit true.
This is the same country that has produced a great number of enormously powerful female politicians long before America even honestly broached the subject - Indira Gandhi being the case in point.
Even now, the head of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and the home to 130 million people, is headed by a woman of dalit origin (India's lowest caste).
The progress of India's democracy in terms of its movement toward social equality has in some ways been as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking.”
Vinod Sharmaalso discusses “vote bank” through an imaginary exchange of words between three powerful women- Mayawati (Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh) who is a “dalit” (lower caste), Maneka Gandhi (Indira Gandhi’s daughter-in-law) and prominent social and animal rights activist, and Sonia Gandhi (Maneka’s estranged sister-in-law) and Congress party supreme.
Here is an excerpt:
“Sonia: The Congress party is a national party with a glorious history.
Mayawati: And no future.
Sonia: Don't say that.
Please.
It hurts.
We are confident of coming back to power on our own.
Mayawati: Really?
Look, I don't care whether anyone is from the Gandhi family or a raja or maharaja.
If you or your son threaten my vote bank in any manner, I will put you both behind bars.”
Every year millions of Muslims converge to Mecca to perform Hajj (pilgrimage), one of the five pillars of Islam.
Is this year's Hajj season being threatened by the A/H1N1 or Swine Flu virus?
Bloggers commenting on the region weigh in.
At CrossRoads Arabia, John Burgess explains:
A Saudi researcher in Shariah law find that there is precedent to ban Umrah pilgrims (those who undertake the non-obligatory, ‘lesser’ pilgrimage) who come from areas beset with the A/H1N1 or swine flu virus.
I suspect that this opinion is being floated now in anticipation of the Haj, which will take place in late November.
The Haj is obligatory, in that every Muslim is required to perform the pilgrimage at least once in his/her life, if feasible.
Similar concerns were raised a few years ago, when bird flu (H5N1) was threatening.
One Saudi scholar called for Haj to be canceled if there were a severe outbreak, but that proposal was shot down by others.
The argument was that Haj had never been canceled on public health grounds and that to do so would be counter to Islam.
Rather, those who are ill are morally obliged to not perform Haj.
Communicable diseases and Haj are historical companions.
There are many records of outbreaks of disease, from plague to cholera, killing thousands in Mecca, Madinah, and Jeddah over the years.
Only toward the end of the 19th C. did strictly enforced quarantines work to stop the spread of diseases out of the region, back to the homes of the pilgrims.
Quarantines and strict enforcement of medical screening can protect pilgrims and that might be enough.
Only time will tell.
Swine flu, as bird flu before it, may turn out to be a non-issue.
If it does not, however, it good that people are starting to think about it now.
The Middle East Institute's Editor's Blog adds:
This is getting stranger and stranger.
The Grand Mufti of Egypt is suggesting Muslim scholars issue a collective fatwa to postpone the hajj due to swine flu.
Arabic version is here.
Keep in mind — I know I keep repeating it — there have been no cases in Egypt.
In fact, according to WHO's rundown as of yesterday, the only cases confirmed in the entire Middle East are in Israel (seven cases).
And WHO says, "WHO is not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of the influenza A(H1N1) virus."
Oh, yes, and another thing: the hajj isn't until November.
Am I missing something here?
Has the hajj ever been postponed for health reasons, in all of Islamic history?
I don't know, but I expect you'd need at least one infected person to justify it.
(Not only are there no cases in the Middle East, except Israel, but none in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan — well, anywhere Muslim.)
The government of Sril Lanka announced via state media and SMS today (Monday, May 18, 2009) afternoon that the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Vellupillai Prabhakaran, is dead.
News media are reporting that Prabhakaran, who was at the helm of one of the world's most violent rebellions, was killed by rocket grenade while in a van with the head of the LTTE's navy, Soosai, and the LTTE intelligence chief, Pottu Amman.
The body of the rebel leader will undergo DNA tests to confirm identity.
About 250 members of the Tamil Tigers were reportedly killed in the final surge of fighting in the country's 26-year-old war.
Obituaries of Prabhakaran note that he was a hero to some and a ruthless killer to others.
The BBC writes, "To his followers, Vellupillai Prabhakaran was a freedom fighter struggling for Tamil emancipation.
To his adversaries he was a secretive megalomaniac with a complete disregard for human life."
The Hindu in India says, "A 'freedom fighter' for his supporters and a dreaded terrorist for others, Prabhakaran was wanted by Interpol and many other organisations since 1990 for terrorism, murder and organised crime." Long before the world was aware of Osama Bin Laden or Al-Qaeda, Prabhakaran started to use a new method of guerrilla warfare, suicide bombing.
This cover story on Tehelka magazine reveals a lot about this war lord.
The Blogger of Beyond Skin explains it this way:
First reaction: WHAAA!
Second reaction: Now what?
After 26 years of fighting, after displacing and killing hundreds of thousands, after silencing those who dissent against both the government and the LTTE through assassinations, torture and disappearance, what now of the Tamil people?
United National Party organizer Ajith P. Perera wrote in his own obituary for Prabhakaran in his blog, Dare to be different: "He was a terrorist, no doubt, but Prabhakaran deserves an obituary, even in a language he barely understood," Perera wrote.
Did he achieve anything worthwhile for his community?
The answer is a big NO.
Ethnic (Jaffna) Tamils are worse off than they were in 1970s.
More than half of the Tamil population has already left for good. Thousands of Tamil families had to live with eternal grief of losing one or more family members.
Ethnic Tamils, the largest minority in Sri Lanka then, has now reduced to the pathetic third place after Muslims and Indian Tamils.
Jaffna, the second most advanced city in Sri Lanka, with its famous education system, is now far behind.
As a community Tamils, at least the unfortunate ones to still remain, have moved ten or twenty years backward.
They were termed as terrorists across the world.
North and East have become more and more economically dependent on Colombo.
At least for the next few years, till a UNP government implements a political solution, they will be remotely controlled from Colombo.
All thanks to Prabhakaran.
Sri Lankan Tamil activist and former LTTE member Nirmala Rajasingam explains in an opinion piece in The Independent that her sister was murdered by the LTTE 20 years ago.
For that reason, the news of the demise of the LTTE's top leadership – which ordered her killing and the killings of many other Tamil dissenters – brings overwhelming relief.
The war and carnage has at last stopped and the insistent bloodletting of Tamil dissent is now over.
But she cautions:
The continued refusal of full access to humanitarian agencies does not allay suspicions about the government's intentions toward the refugees and the LTTE cadres who have surrendered.
The last three years have seen a large number of abductions, extrajudicial killings and disappearances, almost exclusively targeting the Tamil community as the government of Sri Lanka relentlessly pursued its military campaign.
The militarisation of state and society has been able to suppress dissent in the south, even mounting attacks on journalists.
We wait to see whether the government will reverse this downward spiral in democratic governance.
Blogger and columnist Indi Samarajiva used Twitter to discuss the death of Prabhakaran while he was traveling.
He posted messages to his Twitter page on Monday afternoon:
is in Hambantota.
Fire crackers.
Seems Prabhakaran is dead.
No glory in death, but, well, good.
May Sri Lanka rebuild #fb
they're lighting firecrackers literally meters from the gas cylinder depot.
The fishmongers are yelling to get back to work.
Hambantota town is mostly Muslim, back to business.
Flag convoys thru Ambalantota.
War's over, Prabha's dead.
Long live Sri Lanka #fb
Prahalathan KK, a blogger in Chennai, India, says that rejoicing in Prabhakaran's death is a diservice to the civilians killed in order to make the LTTE's defeat possible.
"So Prabhakaran the Terrorist has been killed.
Happy?
Rejoicing?
Ever thought of the thousands of innocent Tamils who were slaughtered by the indiscriminate use of artillery and chemical weapons by the Sri Lankan army during the Genocidal war?"
According to the Ministry of Defence website, the almost 150,000 civilians who have fled the war zone in less than a month are being cared for by the army.
But The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the only independent organization that has had access to civilians in the conflict zone, called the situation "nothing short of catastrophic."
Today, they in a news release that the they have not had access to civilians in the north-east for nine days.
“This is all the more urgent since no humanitarian aid has reached those who need it for over a week,” said director of operations, Pierre Krähenbühl.
Selvarasa Pathmanathan, head of the LTTE’s International Diplomatic Relations, released a statement on Sunday announcing that the Tigers will "silence our guns to save our people."
He said that 3,000 civilians have died and 25,000 are injured.
Prominent South Asian diaspora blog Sepia Mutiny reports on continuing protests in Canada.
In a post about a gathering in Winnipeg. Melvin writes:
They held candles, signs, black flags and pictures of children whom they see as victims of the Sri Lankan government’s assault on civilians.
While people in Colombo and elsewhere celebrated the apparent end of the 25-year civil war, those at the vigil mourned the deaths of innocent people and wondered what, if anything, had been solved. “It doesn’t solve anything,” Singarajah said.
“People’s grievances aren’t going to be over.
This government is so ruthless.
They don’t want to give us our rights.
As long as that is the case, the problems will go on.”
Protests have been ongoing in London, many parts of Canada and more recently in Australia.
But activist Rajasingam cautioned in Foreign Policy magazine that the Tamil diaspora has taken a misguided approach to its message:
As Sri Lanka's humanitarian crisis unfolds, the international community must make its message clear and forthright.
The Tigers and the diaspora that supports them have no claim as the "sole representation" of the Tamil people.
Nor is secession a reasonable option.
Only this firm message will serve the cause of peace and democracy.
At Moving Images, Moving People! blogger Nalaka Gunawardene says that he wants to believe that the war is truly over:
Sure, there is no independent verification – it has been a war without witnesses for the last few years.
But I am willing to take an unusual leap of faith if that’s what it takes to usher in the long-elusive peace.
I will go to the ends of the earth, and suspend disbelief if I have to, in return for lasting and meaningful peace.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa is scheduled to address Parliament and the nation on Tuesday morning.
Egyptians witnessed the most unexpected verdict in the history of their judiciary system: Billionaire Hesham Talaat Moustafa, along with his hired hitman Mohsen El Sokary, have both been sentenced to death for their roles in the murder of Lebanese singer Suzanne Tameem.
The gruesome murder took place in Dubai, UAE, and Thursday's sentence was met with shock and bewilderment as the blogosphere comes to terms with the verdict.
Egyptian prolific blogger Zeinobia broke the news:
On May 21, Judge Muhammadi Qunsuwa announced the case will be referred to Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, the nation's highest religious official, who will rule on Moustafa's death sentence on June 25.
Shocking as it is to everyone, the verdict left the convicted in awe.
Reactions varied outside the court house, but the majority of people saw that the punishment was fair for a man who abused his authority, influence and money, thinking that he was above the law.
Reactions fluctuated, between approval and support to the verdict to sympathy and sadness.
Once the verdict was read, chaos erupted in court, with the families of Mohsen and Hesham screaming as well as the employees of the Talaat Moustafa Group, who couldn't believe what they heard.
Meanwhile, Hesham and Mohsen were completely silent.
Personally, I couldn't believe it because Hesham's crime was instigating murder while Mohsen was the one who killed.
How can their punishment be the same?
In some laws, the punishment is even more severe than that met to the criminal.
The Egyptian real-estate tycoon’s supporters on Facebook, reacted to the verdict on “Free Hesham Talaat Moustafa’ group as well.
Ashraf Elmanwaty said:
I still have hope HTM will be free... This is an over reaction judgment
While Miral El Ramlawy wrote:
90% of Egyptians do NOT believe he did it and the court owes it to the Egyptians to announce what they based the verdict upon!!
Phone calls that don't have any explicit message is NO PROOF...we are waiting for justification!
After the shock, analysis took place.
Zeinobia explains:
• when the judge says that that the papers of the convicted will be sent to the grand Mufti for consulting means in most situations that that convicted will face the death penalty.
The death penalty needs the opinion of the grand Mufti to support it from the religious point of view ,the Sharia point of view to fulfill justice.It is not everyday that you order the death of someone.
• In most cases if not all of them the grand Mufti approves and supports the judge’s verdict.
She then continues:
• Second in case of Hisham and Sokary,the judge will announce the final verdict on the next 25th of June 2009 ,which is nearly about month and 5 days ,I believe it is a long period to stand in the death row.
• Third when the judge announces the final verdict , the lawyers of the convicted will have the right to .
So there might be a second round which is what we will figure out on June 25th.
Meanwhile, there are questions and doubts about Hisham’s high profile real estate business.
The Mideast Institute Editor's blog reports:
The Talaat Mustafa Group (TMG), a huge real estate conglomerate through which Mustafa made his billions, doesn't want any stockholders to worry just because the company's founder and namesake is under a death sentence.
A TMG official reassures investors:
Sawaftah said that TMG’s corporate structure prevents “the absence of one individual” from affecting its activity
With the elections over and the incumbent president Bingu wa Mutharika sworn in for his second and last term, Malawian bloggers (Mabloga) are awed by two developments that went against the predictions of many, especially the punditry.
First was the suggestion that the presidential contest would be very close.
It wasn't.
Second was the perception that Malawians would once again vote on regional and ethnic lines.
They did not.
Other fascinating aspects of the elections being discussed by the "Mabloga" include the role that Internet radio played in informing Diaspora Malawians on events as they unfolded, and what the new parliament might look like, what with a good number of the newly-elected members of parliament boasting university professorial and international civil service careers, long term PhDs, and other post-graduate qualifications.
The blog Chingwe's Hole reacts to both disproved predictions, then goes through a list of six aspects that make the May 2009 elections historic.
According to Chingwe's Hole, key structures of Malawi's institutions performed well.
And in marking the probable end of the political career of the 77 year-old leader of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), John Tembo, these elections also ended the era of the nationalist generation that has ruled Malawi since 1964, a point also made by Paul Tiyambe Zeleza.
Tembo is reported to have already been put forward as the MCP's candidate in the next elections in 2014, according to Chris Banda on the Internet forum Malawitalk.
Chingwe's Hole's third aspect is that the voting pattern was driven by substantive matters of development, over personalities, and more poignantly for many bloggers as well, over ethnicity, Chingwe's Hole's fourth and fifth historical aspects of these elections.
The last aspect deals with how the punditry overestimated the strength of the main challenger, John Tembo, in his party's alliance with the United Democratic Front (UDF).
On this point Chingwe's Hole unleashes pointed criticism:
And finally the elections have exposed the vacuity of some of the political punditry in Malawi.
Our most cited political pundits simply do not know what they are talking about... They kept analsising politics along the same old lines and seemed to base their views based only on whim srather than research and reflection.
Listening to our oft cited “political analysts” the coalition was supposed to be a formidable force; the elections would be a a”close call”; Bingu had made a fatal mistake chosing a Southern as running mate; the economy growth had not benefitted the majority etc . . .
As one of the pundits who predicted a strong showing for the MCP/UDF alliance and its candidate John Tembo, Boniface Dulani makes a confession mid-way through the vote counting when it is becoming apparent that Bingu wa Mutharika is defying expectations:
I must confess I did not expect the margin of victory that appears to be emerging from the election results as currently being announced.
For all intents and purposes, Mutharika appears to be headed for a strong landslide performance.
While Bingu is performing strongly in the northern region as predicted, he has also performed just as strongly in the central region and the southern region.
For Greenwell Matchaya, the incumbent's victory across the entire nation might be the beginning of the end of politics of ethnicity:
In the first place, the size of Bingu’s victory in the presence of a seemingly powerful opposition alliance is the first I have ever heard of in Africa.
Furthermore, the fact that there were no any reported cases of rigging, makes his win even more credible and even more and more wonderful.
Bingu’s party, the DPP, won the presidential election with roughly 2,730,630 votes while the MCP/UDF alliance scooped circa 1,270,057, almost 200,000 votes below half of Bingu’s votes The strong message arising from these figures is that Bingu was voted into power by the entire nation, raising postulates about whether good leadership styles could obliterate the tribal cancer that many of us thought was out to consume our political and everyday lives.
Clement Nyirenda also remarks on how the punditry got it wrong, and finds the voting pattern for the incumbent president's win epochal:
[. . . the pundits thought that John Tembo would garner more votes from the Southern region while beating Mutharika comprehensively in the Central Region, MCP’s stronghold.
Mutharika was expected to carry the day in the less populous Northern Region.
At the end of everything, the pundits have been proved wrong because Dr. Mutharika was proclaimed the winner with more than 6o% of the vote.
Since the advent of multiparty democracy, I have never seen a presidential candidate getting votes from all the corners of the country like this.
And words of awe continue with Cryton Chikoko, who writes in the third person with the alias "Rambler":
Rambler has to confess he was not expecting Malawians to vote on merit.
Admittedly Rambler wrongly thought that just like in the previous elections regionalism will rule the day.
The 2009 elections have come to him as a pleasant surprise.
A fresh breath in our politics.
Victor Kaonga pays tribute to the role that radio stations played in informing listeners of the results during the long breaks waiting for the Malawi Electoral Commission.
On Malawian Internet listserv forums, appreciation for the role of radio stations has especially focused on Zodiak Broadcasting Station, which broadcasts across Malawi, and recently started streaming live on the Internet.
Listserv discussions have also widely debated what parliament might look like, given the large number of highly educated Malawians who have been elected to parliament, a topic also discussed by Chingwe's Hole.
On the Internet forum Nyasanet, the question of who will be chosen to fill cabinet posts is being debated on the basis of the intelligentsia voted into the legislature, which is being likened to an academic symposium.
Blogger Kondwani Munthali has already provided his dream cabinet list.
This post is part of the Global Voices special coverage on the Indian Elections 2009
Election results are pouring in from all across the country and it is now clear that India has voted decisively for a stable government at the center, under the leadership of the Congress-led UPA.
Dr. Manmohan Singh is going to be the Prime Minister for a second consecutive term.
Even before all the results are in, just going by the trends, the BJP-led NDA alliance has publicly conceded defeat.
The UPA Chairperson, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi congratulated the electorate on this mandate.
At a press conference at her residence at 4.00pm IST, she said, "The people of India know what is good for them and they have made the right choice."
As of now (5.40pm IST) the national tally (results) is as follows:
Total no. of seats = 543
No. of seats needed to stake claim to power (majority) = 272
UPA alliance - leads+wins = 258
NDA alliance - leads+wins = 162
3rd Front - leads+wins = 68
Others (including the 4th Front) - leads+wins = 55
Indian elections (#indiavotes09) is a top trending topic on twitter today.
A few reactions from tweeters:
@jraghu - Indian citizens give verdict.
Congress led UPA wins safe, free elections in largest free democracy.
Thank you, all #India #Indiavotes09
@calamur - #indiavotes09 - Singh is King - Advani v/s PM. whining v/s strength. bitterness v/s vision.powerlust v/s duty.
India chose well
While there is jubilation in many quarters, there is gloom among the supporters of the BJP.
Blogger Chakresh Mishra writes on his blog:
my biggest sympathy is with BJP, which is the party I voted for.
A nationalist party.
It is a loss of face for BJP.
But friends, There are times in history of a nation when all seem lost and looks like wrong forces have won the final battle.
But dear friends, it is just a process, which goes on and on.
5 years may be significant time period in life of a man, but in life of a nation (that too a nation like India) is just a flickr of eye.
The time after defeat is not for grief and blame-game.
It is the time to introspect and start preparing to come out as winner in next battle.
Though hopes are shattered and nightmares are prevailing, the dawn will surely come.
It is not the first black day of Indian history, we survived and fought back.
Let us do that again.
Update:
Tally as of 1pm IST, 17/05/09:
Total no. of seats = 543
No. of seats needed to stake claim to power (majority) = 272
UPA alliance - leads+wins = 262
NDA alliance - leads+wins = 157
3rd Front - leads+wins = 67
Others (including the 4th Front) - leads+wins = 57
The UPA alliance now needs to garner support for only about 10 seats.
Whom will they invite to be a part of their coalition?
Watch this space.
The day started across Honduras with news that President Mel Zelaya was arrested in his home by armed soldiers.
A referendum vote was scheduled for the same day, which was one that was opposed by the Supreme Court, the Armed Forces and the Honduran legislature.
Days earlier, Zelaya had removed the head of the Armed Forces, General Romeo Vásquez Velásquez, which was followed by the resignation by other top military officials because they would not support the vote.
It was soon learned that Zelaya had been taken to Costa Rica, where he continued to call himself as the legal head of state.
There was also a rumor that Zelaya had resigned.
However, the alleged letter turned out to be false notes Juan Carlos Rivera of Miradas de Halcón .
The reaction from the blogosphere and twittosphere ranged from calling the situation a coup d'état to those who saw the move as the only way to stop Zelaya's controversial move.

There have been power outages in the capital city, as reported by Honduras Daily News, which speculates that it is an "attempt to limit the passing of information."
However, information is currently being passed through social networking sites like Twitter and Blipea, which were very active throughout the day.
A supporter of Zelaya, Hibueras wrote:
More than 100,000 people marched in Tehran on Monday in support of reformist presidential candidate, Mir Hussein Mousavi and his demands for an annulment of the election results that declared incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the election on June 12.
The march ended in bloodshed.
At least 7 people lost their lives.
According to a report on Britain's Channel 4 television, (aired in spite of a foreign reporting ban) a crowd threw rocks and set fire to a building that belonged to the pro-government Basij militia.
A helmeted militiaman on the roof fired his AK-47 rifle into the air before retreating from a shower of stones.
On YouTube there is more citizen video of how this attack happened:
The morning after this shooting, the staff of Rasool Akram Hospital in Tehran demonstrated against the killings.
One demonstrator holds a placard that says: "8 martyrs"
Shootings or repression have not stopped the protest movement, and thousands marched again in Tehran on Tuesday.
Demonstrations are growing in other cities too.
In Shiraz, protesters shown in this video burned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's photo.
Thousands of people demonstrated in Tehran, Mashhad and several other major cities in Iran to protest against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's proclaimed victory in the Iranian presidential election on Friday.
Two different reformist rivals and their supporters insist there was election fraud at play.
Mir Hussein Moussavi, the main challenger of Ahmadinejad said the results from "untrustworthy monitors" reflect "the weakening of the pillars that constitute the sacred system" of Iran and "the rule of authoritarianism and tyranny."
Several scenes of street fights and demonstrations are uploaded on YouTube.
A demonstration in Valiasr street in Tehran where thousands of protesters demonstrated and chanted slogans against the Ahmadinejad government.
And here people chanted: 'Moussavi, take back my vote!'.
Security forces repressed protesters:
Another demonstration was held in Mashhad where protesters asked security forces to support them .
Ghomar Ashegahne has published several photos showing security forces beating protesters (see photo above).
The blogger writes that the repression would be a good reason not to go to streets to protest, but 'what can we do with all this sorrow?'.
He says Karoubi and Moussavi who wanted to change situation in country, should start now.
Belgiran writes that Iranian Leader, Ali Khamenei, overthrew Moussavi by a coup before he even bacame president and replaced him with Ahmadinejad... He writes, "This regime just lost the little legitimacy that it had."
Mehrdadd writes on Twitter, that the Iranian Leader shows he is against the Iranian people.
Now any political personality should take a position for or against people.
Mehri912 says on Twitter, "If Iran sleeps tonight, it will sleep forever".
Tehran protests, via jomhour.info
Hundreds of thousands of Iranians in Tehran and several other cities have rallied to support presidential candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi, defying a government ban on demonstrations.
Protesters are calling for the annulment of the presidential election results, saying President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory in the 12th of June election is a fraud.
Security forces have struck down hard on demonstrators, and at least one person was killed in Tehran today.
Although Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are currently blocked in Iran, many Iranians have been using proxies to bypass filters and report up-to-the-minute news.
Iranian authorities have also blocked SMS text messages, and are also filtering several news websites reflecting reformist opinions.
Iran09 tweeted earlier today:
"I confirm that there's a Basij station around the square and they shot ppl from the roof. #iranelection"
Jadi tweeted:
"People are still joining to the demonstration.
Chanting 'Mousavi!
Mousavi!
Take back my vote' #IranElection"
Mousavi spoke and called for the election results to be reviewed.
He said he is ready to take part in a new election.
There are some video news clips about the election here.
As protest grows so does repression
Students who protested against the presidential election at diffrent universities were attacked by security forces.
Here is a video film showing a dormitory of the University of Tehran on Sunday night.
Update: Here is a Flickr slideshow of photos showing more of the destruction left behind by security forces in University of Tehran dormitories on Sunday night.
According to the Flickr user, Agha Hadi, many students were jailed.
Below, is a film showing an Iranian woman taking on security forces by a bus stop.
Azarmehr comments on this film:
Look at this brave Iranian lioness, first she swing kicks and then she side kicks the neanderthal truncheon wielding riot guard!
She gets a few baton strikes but this is the price for freedom and she cares not.Blessed is our motherland Iran, for having such daughters.
The fear is gone and the momentum continues.
Thanks to Tehranlive we have several photos of Iranian people's protest and resistance movement:
Green Vote tweeted that one of people's slogan is, 'Don't be afraid, we are all together'.
Green Vote also tweeted that Mohammad Ali Tarekh, a student activist, was arrested in Shiraz.
Several bloggers such as Zeitoon report that people chant Allah-0-Akbar (God is Greater) from their houses during the night.
Mousavi asked people to chant Allah-o-Akbar from the rooftops of their homes.
During 1978-79 Islamic Revolution people use to do the same as a protest move against Shah.
Where is Obama?
View from Iran, an American blogger, writes:
Ultimately, I know that rhetoric is just rhetoric.
That the words of a president do not actually change history even though they become part of it.
If ever there was a time for Obama to turn on his rhetorical charm, it is now.
Today at 4 pm there will be demonstrations in 20 cities in Iran.
My friends *want to be on the streets.* They are parents, civil servants, accountants, receptionists, and yes students.
In the end, with all of the violence, I am not sure that they will show up.
So Obama, turn on your charm.
Use your powers of rhetoric to tell Iranians that, while we won't be sending in the marines, our hearts are with you.
I know you can do a better job than I can.
Isfahan's suffering
Tehran is not the only city where people protesting have been repressed.
Protesters in Isfahan, have also been the targets of security forces.
Iranevents has published several photos of Iranian protests.
People are being chased by security forces here:

Malawians are currently voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections.
A group of Malawian bloggers were trained by PenPlusBytes, an International Institute of ICT Journalism in collaboration with New Media Institute to monitor and comment on the elections using blogs, twitter and mobile phones.
Let's take a look at their blogs, which are hosted on The African Elections Portal.
The African Elections Portal provides comprehensive election related information on the various countries in Africa.
According to blogger Eric Chilenje, the 2009 elections in Malawi will be heavily contested:
The 2009 General Elections will be one of those elections that appear to be heavily contensted.In the first place, we have seen the former head of state Dr Bakili Muluzi, being stopped by Malawi Electoral Commission from contesting for the third time as president.This was done in accordiance with the Malawi Constitution whiuch stipulates that a presiednt shall only serve two consecutive terms.
One other interesting aspects during the 2009 General Elections is that we have seen United Democtracti Front , a party being being led by Dr Bakili Muluzi forming a 'coalition' with Malawi Congress Party of John Tembo.
Norman Fulatira makes a similar observation:
The 2009 Elections in Malawi seem to be the first since the country attained multiparty democracy.
The hype that is there perhaps suggests that this time around the contest is high.
I percieve that the 2009 elections in Malawi hangs around the issue of greed among the leaders.
None of the leaders is mentioning about an ideology to follow once elected into power save for pressidential independent candidate Mr. James Nyondo.
McDonald Bamusi argues that what the decision of two political parties, UDF and MCP, to support a single candidate has made the race very tight:
This year's general elections in malawi have been one of the most closely contested.
This has been the case especially because of the agreement of UDF and MCP to support one candidate in the name of John Zenus Ungapake Tembo.
Michael notes that rural voters will not be taken for granted in this year's elections:
This year's race for Malawi General Elections will be tight.
All major political parties are concentrating their campaign in the rural areas.
These are the people that are in majority.
The rural masses may not be taken for granted this year as they now know and appreciate who the good leader is.
The Civil Society, Media and Religious Institutions are playing a vital role in making sure that the Electorate have the right information concerning the elections.
This will help the public to make an informed decision on who to vote for on May 19.
Wesysylas reports that the a Democratic Progressive Party bus was stoned in Machinga Distrtict:
Barely a day after some some nasty scenes occured at a rally organised by united democratict front national chairman Dr Bakili Muluzi at Goliati in Thyolo district, the scenerior wore a new face when a Democratic progressive Party Bus was on Wednsday stoned in machinga District.
The good news is that, according to the Human Rights Consultative Committee, the levels of violence during the 2009 campaign period have decreased compared to the 2004 elections:
Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC) has said levels of violence during the 2009 campaign period in preparation for the 19 May general elections have decreased compared to what was experienced in 2004.
The campaign period has ended today at 6 o’clock in the morning.
HRCC vice National Coordinator Cecilia Mussa said the development is a clear demonstration that Malawians have realized that power is not a tool to bring personal agenda.
The 2009 elections according to Nicolas Mbonela is one of its kind:
Malawi's fourth coming general election on 19 May 2009 will be of their own kind looking at the political developments that are transpiring in the country.
The political rivals are busy castigating each other just to make sure that they woo support from most illiterate Malawians that form the majority of the country's population and electorate.
Malawi Elections Breaking News reports that property owners in Malawi are demanding money for campaign posters places on their property:
Some small scale property owners in Blantyre are demanding, at least, K500 for political posters placed in their area of business or enterprise, it has been learnt.
The development has prompted some property owners to openly advertise for their places, as one poster at Blantyre Old Town indicated Sunday morning.
One of the places where politicians are said to have paid for a place is at the Curios centre, near Malawi Savings Bank in Blantyre .
One of the curios’ sellers disclosed in an interview the posters now selling themselves at the place were paid for, and that each did cost K500 for the depicted political parties.
The posters there include the faces of Bingu wa Mutharika and one for John Tembo, Malawi Congress Party’s torch bearer in the May19 polls.
Jessie Puwapuwa observes that in 1994 Malawians voted in order to get rid of Kamuzu Banda who had ruled Malawi for 30 years:
Election time as it is people cast their votes inorder to put into or remove people from positions.
This is the third time Malawians will be going to polls to choose a leader after their hearts.
In 1994 Malawians were eager to go to vote just to get rid of Malawi Cogress Party which had ruled the country for 30 years under what they called 'Dictatorship of late His Excellency Ngazi Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda.' this was the beginning of democratic dispensation and the United Democratic Party President Dr. Bakili Muluzi was the first leader to be elected and re-elected in 1999.
In 2004 Dr. Bingu Wa Mutharika was elected to this honourable office on a UDF.
In his post titled "Malawi: The Economy, Stupid?," Mujo writes, "Despite facing a strong alliance of the main opposition leader and a former president, the incumbent is expected to win on the back of an economic boom":
On May 19, voters in Malawi will go to the polls to elect their next president.
The Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for the last four years and is fielding President Bingu wa Mutharika as its candidate once again.
Despite facing a strong alliance of the main opposition leader and a former president, the incumbent is expected to win on the back of an economic boom. Though critics accuse Mutharika of rigging his way into office, he is credited with helping to improve Malawi’s economy.
Since he took over, the country has experienced an average economic growth of 7 percent.
“He inherited a very politically and economically mismanaged legacy … and it was a very tall order to get the country running, to try to get the confidence of very important external players in Malawi,” said Dimpho Motsamai, a political analyst at the Institute for Global Dialogue in South Africa who specializes on Malawi.
“So his vision was one of economic rejuvenation, stricter physical management of economic resources — very prudent management of economic resources — and one that would deal with socio-economic inequalities in Malawi,” she told Reuters Africa Journal.
George Kanyange expects the 2009 elections to be one of the most exciting elections in the history of Malawi:
This year's elections are promising to be the most exciting ever in Malawi.
There certain factors that make our elections unique.
First is the fact that one of the key political parties contesting in the elections is the ruling party, the Democrartyic Progerssive Party (DPP), that was never ever eleected by the electorate for it to be in power.
Another interesting aspect is that the former ruling party, the United Democratic Party (UDF), is not fielding a presidential candiate after its leader, Bakili Muluzi, was rejected by the Electoral Commission, which has forced the party to go into an alliance with another leading positiion, the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) which is also the oldest party in the country.
Media not considered in Party Manifestos, writes Big Up:
All seven presidential candidates, in next week’s general elections, have come under fire, for not incorporating anything tangible, to do with media in their manifestoes.These include, MCP/UDF’s John Tembo, DPP’s Bingu wa Mutharika, Aford’s Dindi Gowa Nyasulu, NARC’s Loveness Gondwe, RP’s Stanley Masauli, PETRA’s Kamuzu Chibambo and Independent James Nyondo.This has since prompted some journalists, to question the country’s political officials, on whether they indeed regard the media, as the fourth estate or not, in line with the constitution.
And those fears are not without a basis and are too far from the truth. The voters roll remains a mess days before the elections are held; the opposition is yet to get over its grudge that the government shortchanged it in apoointing commissioners to the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC); the state broadcasters, Malawi Broadcasting Corporation and Malawi Television, remain largely closed to the opposition and they are heavily manipulated in government's favour; the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is using (read abusing) government resources to campaign...
With such a situation, can anything ever be right with these elections?
Mozambican bloggers Carlos Serra and Paulo Granjo respond to the attack yesterday against politician Daviz Simango, in the northern Mozambican port city of Nacala.
In addition to the reactions from the blogosphere, Simango's party (@mdmwiki), tweeted the attack.
Simango is the mayor of Beira, and founded his new party MDM earlier this year, after falling out with traditional opposition party RENAMO.
Just days ago, he and his party confirmed a planned bid for the Presidency and a campaign for the October election.
Simango was heading for a meeting of his party when his car was shot at by individuals in the assembled crowd who grabbed police weapons.
He escaped unharmed but media reports indicate three people were injured, including a policeman.
Initial reports from Mozambican independent media suggest the shooters were members of RENAMO.
Togo's National Assembly voted on Tuesday to end the death penalty for all crimes, making it the 15th member of the African Union to abolish capital punishment.
Although death sentences have been given for crimes as recently as 2003, Togo has not carried out an execution since 1978.
Ephrem L on togosite.com writes:
The Iranian presidential election will be held on June 12.
Only four men, out of more than 400 self-registered men and women, were given official approval by the Guardian Council for the candidacy.
The sharp eyes of blogger-photographers have captured moments and scenes in the streets of Iran where people promote their favorite candidates and political demands.
Maryam Majd has published several photos on Feminist School about "women’s independent presence in the electoral space."
In Feminist School we read that "Tajrish sq.
Emamzadeh Saleh (a holy shrine in the north of Tehran) and the memorable Tajrish Bazaar were hosts to the volunteer members of the "Coalition of Women’s Movement".
They enthusiastically demanded an independent presence for women in the city’s electoral space.
Their slogan was: "We Vote for Women’s Rights."
Their wish is for Iranian authorities to put an end to all discriminatory laws against women.
Saba Vasefi also captured this movement in action on Feminist School.
In Zoherpix Photo blog we see how Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's and Mir Hussein Mousavi's supporters are waving the photos of their favorite candidates:
Janet Museveni
February's cabinet reshuffle has Ugandan bloggers making 2011 election predictions.
Among the new appointments President Yoweri Museveni made was the posting of his wife Janet as state minister for Karamoja, a region in northeastern Uganda that has been plagued by conflict and extreme poverty for decades.
While some bloggers think the high-profile appointment could bring much-needed attention to the region, others are more skeptical.
Ariaka notes:
Takinfg the cue, H.E President Yoweri finally made the cabinet reshuffle that had lingered in the grapvine for over six months.
And what a reshuffle.
We saw the appointment of a first lady, also MP for Ruhama county of Ntungamo district to the Karamoja portfolio.
We saw Syda Bumba, transfered from Labour to the all important Finance docket.
It is the first time in Uganda that a first lady is a Minister, forget that hers is a junior portfolio.
It is also the first time that a women has been appointed a finance Minister.
These are not simple appointments.
It is a political chess game where the master has his eye set on victory.
Daniel Kalinaki, a journalist who often blogs on political issues and who published an editorial on the appointment in Uganda's Daily Monitor, agrees:
There is, of course, nothing wrong with Janet’s ambitions.
She is a Ugandan and has a right to seek or be appointed to any office for which she is qualified.
However, when a President has been in power for 23 years and begins to surround himself with relatives, friends and in-laws, he begins to look more like a village chief bent on carrying on his bloodline than a reforming democrat.
Antipop at Let There Be Me takes a more humorous approach, speculating on how Museveni arrived at his decision.
She offers several theories, including that the announcement was a belated Valentine's Day gift:
The one about Valentine's day
...The next day at breakfast, realizing that he was in trouble, and not willing to get into any confrontation, he told her that last night was a deliberate move to get her all worked up but he had a surprise for her that would sure make up for everything.
And on Tuesday Feb 17th, she learned of it in her favorite tabloid.
She found out just how long she would have to travel to unveil her belated Valentine ’s Day gift and was not amused.
Lingerie would have done just fine.
Not all bloggers are as critical, though.
Phantom of Even Steven ends a post on the Oscars by asking:
In other news, what’s so bad about posting Janet Museveni to Karamoja?
Commenting on the post, chanelno5 defends Janet Museveni:
There is nothing wrong with that.
If she wants what everyone shuns go ahead.
In fact those people might benefit from her appointment.
Tumwijuke at Ugandan Insomiac considers this point of view, but she still questions the appointment:
Perhaps this appointment is Yoweri Museveni’s way of sending a message of solidarity to the people of Karamoja.
Perhaps he hopes that the bevy of brown nose humanitarian types who support his wife’s every cause will transfer their ‘goodwill’ to developmental programs in Karamoja.
Perhaps a picture of Mama Janet cuddling a snotty nosed Karamojong baby will be good PR for the Museveni government.
Still, I can’t shake this ominous feeling...
Dennis Matanda, who recently posted the second part of a four-part series titled "Uganda's Next President," offers his predictions on who will succeed Museveni:
Although the current President has not made an effort to groom a successor from the ruling National Resistance Movement, his wife Hon. Janet Museveni, MP who recently became appointed Minister and his son, Lt. Col. Muhoozi Kainerugaba are front runners.
Joe in Uganda summarizes the shake-up in a post titled "Dynasty?", noting that Janet's appointment "was widely seen as a sign of things to come."
On a personal note, having worked on Karamoja for the past two months, I was delighted to see a high profile Minister taking over the portfolio.
The region is in urgent need of attention.
Uganda's Internet penetration rate is a little over six percent, a number that prevents large swaths of the population from joining Uganda's blogren or accessing the global blogosphere.
For one village, the Guardian and Observer's Katine Project is working to change that.
Since October 2007, the Katine Project has tracked the impact of a dedicated £2.5 million ($4 million) AMREF development project in Katine, a rural sub-county in northeastern Uganda (virtual tour).
In addition to providing general news about Uganda and tracking developments in five key project areas, the project has been training local residents to use video cameras to document their lives:
, almost 20 people from Katine attended three video workshops held in the media and resource centre, now opened to villagers at the Amref office in the sub-county.
Four Flip video cameras and tripods have been left in the centre for villagers to borrow and tell their stories.... The aim of the centre is to give members of the Katine community a global platform to talk about their lives – the challenges and opportunities, their thoughts on the work being carried out by Amref - and to offer them access to information and expertise.
The resulting videos are presented in the project's Village Voices section.
In one, Katine resident John Ogalo shows viewers his homestead and attends a church service.
Another video shadows bicycle taxi driver Dennis Ewalu as he repairs his bicycle, negotiates with customers and cycles nearly 80 km (50 miles) in one day.
The Village Voices section also connects readers to local residents through text.
One post shares the stories of three schoolgirls who discuss their hopes for their future:
Teresa Acupo
In future, I want to study politics and become a member of parliament for my area.
Members of parliament earn a lot of money and they are respected.
Susan Amweso
My dream is to be a financially independent woman.
I need to control my own finances, not to depend on a husband for everything.
Magdalene Atai
My grandparents have been responsible for my entire upbringing and when I finish my education, I will buy them each a present.
Because they may not be able to educate me up to university, I would like to train as a nurse after my secondary education.
That is what most girls who cannot afford further education go for.
It is also easy to get employed as a nurse.
One can easily start a private clinic in the village for survival.
Katine's 25,000 residents live entirely off of Uganda's electricity grid.
Without the Katine Project, it is unlikely that these people would ever get the chance to share their stories with the world.
Discussions about the popular instrument called the vuvuzela blown by South African football fans have dominated the blogosphere since the beginning of Confederations Cup 2009 in South Africa, which ended last week.
Journalists, TV viewers, coaches and some foreign players called for a ban of the instrument during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
The debate is as loud as the instrument itself.
There is even an online petition to ban the instrument.
FIFA has allowed vuvuzelas during the World Cup 2010 arguing that it is part of an authentic South African football culture.
This is Wikipedia description of the vuvuzela:
a blowing horn, approximately one metre in length, commonly blown by fans at football matches in South Africa.
The origin of the name is disputed. It may originate from the Zulu for "making noise," from the "vuvu" sound it makes, or from township slang related to the word for "shower."
Opinions in the blogosphere are deeply divided.
Some bloggers are completely outraged by the sound produced by vuvuzelas while others call for tolerance and understanding.
One blogger goes as far as claiming that the instrument spreads HIV!
Dave Taylor describes vuvuzelas as "the traditional instruments of football mayhem."
To Chris of World Cup blog, the vuvuzela is "that giant swarm of insects...":
That giant swarm of insects you’ve been hearing at every Confederations Cup game is not, in fact, one of the Biblical Plagues migrating south.
It’s actually called a vuvuzela...
Capitals Kremlin considers the vuvuzela the most annoying noisemaker:
Ladies and gentlemen, Caps Kremlin is pleased to present to you: the world's most annoying noisemaker, the vuvuzela.
There is one long description of the vuvuzela from 24.com:
...take a sport from England called football, take a snort of glitter-eyed powder-nosed marketing gnomes, a large liquor conglomerate wanting to increase market share, add a white guy called Van Schalkwyk with a take-the-gap mentality and a plastics factory and what do you get?
The vuvuzela.
Pitch Invasion calls the vuvuzela "Satan's instrument."
Welcome to plastic Africa:
You then follow it up with a barrage of press releases about the kudu horn being used in ancient times to summon villagers to meetings, Christian cults claiming it as part of their sacred rituals and we get stuck with football games that can only be watched on TV with the mute button firmly on.
And if you don’t like it, you must be at best a racist or at worst one of those guys who when he hears the word “culture” reaches for his gun.
Welcome to plastic Africa.
And rue an opportunity missed.
From the Foreign Policy blog, "The World Cup's biggest concern is a trumpet,"
Five years ago, when South Africa won the right to host the 2010 World Cup, many were concerned whether the country had the infrastructure to host the huge tournament.
With one year to go, though, most observers agree that the country will be pass that test. Instead, the biggest complaints have centered on an instrument called the vuvuzela.
ReasonCheck wonders, "...if these heathen brutes could be introduced to the joys of producing actual musical notes from their hellish plastic pipes":
If you’ve caught any of the games on TV, you would have heard a continuous droning sound, like a perpetually embittered swarm of hornets.
But you really have to be there to appreciate the full horror of the cacophony.
I took my son to a game a few nights ago and have been suffering from headaches ever since, and am sleeping fitfully.
I then got to thinking that if these heathen brutes could be introduced to the joys of producing actual musical notes from their hellish plastic pipes there might just be a shift in Zeitgeist amongst them and they might seek to actually make music.
Pitch Invasion looks at the history of noisemaking in world football starting with the first popular noisemaker in Britain, the wooden rattle:
The first popular noisemaker in football — and one that made a sound to make even a vuvuzela wince — was the wooden rattle in Britain.
Writing in the Guardian, Simon Burnton hoped that “perhaps South Africa can learn from the loud wooden rattles that soundtracked British football in the post-war era – and fell out of favour when everyone realised just how annoying they were. I can only hope that one day soon a similar fate will befall the vuvuzelas.”
Yet it was a shift in the entire base of fan culture, rather than a simple realisation that rattles were annoying, that removed the rattle from the terraces.
Though a fairly recent instrument at South African football games, some trace the roots to African tradition.
“The ancestor of the vuvuzela is said to be the kudu horn - ixilongo in isiXhosa, mhalamhala in Tshivenda - blown to summon African villagers to meetings.”
It seems to have been in 1992 that the vuvuzela was first used at South African football matches, by supporters of AmaZulu F.C..
Supporters made the horns out of discarded tin cans, and the use spread wildly, to the joy of many and the irritation of some: South African writer Jon Qwelane wrote in 2007 that “Nowadays, there is an instrument from hell, called the vuvuzela, which has largely formed my decision to abandon all live games and rather watch on TV, with the sound totally muted.”
In the 2000s, with South Africa’s World Cup bid on the horizon, the vuvuzela became a mass produced commercialised phenomenon as the result of a grant given by SAB Miller (the giant South African brewer) to Neil van Schalkwyk’s company Masincedane Sport in 2001, who began to mass produce a cheap plastic version.
SA Sucks disputes the "history" of the vuvuzela as "the ridiculous lie being spread via Wikipedia":
Incredibly, the ridiculous lie is now being spread via Wikipedia (thanks Karooboy for pointing out) that the origin of the Vuvuzela is actually based on a “Kudu horn” that the blacks used to blow.
I almost died laughing at this pathetic fiction but suppose its to be expected - the truth that these destructive beasts ripped them from trains in orgies of vandalism is obviously too politically incorrect to swallow.
A bit further down this article is an image of a yellow horn-shaped vuvuzela - I got this image from one of the hundreds of spam emails which landed up in my mailbox, urging me to order 10 000 of these pieces of shit, with my corporate logo stuck on them.
The horn shape is extremely unusual but as with the Wikipedia article, to be expected as PR companies do their best to bury the real history behind it.
According to SA Sucks there is nothing authentic African about the vuvuzela:
One of the things I love most about the politicians that run this fair dominion is how, at their discretion, they can make up their own history as they go along. The vuvuzela is one such example.
Those arguing for the vuvuzela maintain that it is part of the great South African soccer culture and that not allowing it would truly be an injustice. Bullshit.
They’ve been around less than ten years.
It was only when some bastard called “Neil van Schalkwyk, the co-owner of Masincedane Sport, which manufactures the plastic vuvuzela, won the SAB KickStart Award in 2001, which is an SAB-run project that assists entrepreneurs by providing grants and mentorship during the start-up phase of business.” that the vuvuzela really started making an impact.
Dave Taylor found the noise from the vuvuzela annoying and distracting:
A half-dozen fans having one of these, or even a lot of fans who blow on them to celebrate a goal or terrific defensively play is one thing, but as those of us that watched the FIFA Confederations Cup learned, the practice in South Africa seems to be to keep a continuous drone of vuvuzela going throughout the match.
And we’re not talking about twenty or thirty people in the stadium, we’re talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of locals keeping a deafening racket during the entire match.
I found the constant clamor to be most distracting and annoying, and it even got in the way of being able to hear the crowd reaction to terrific plays or bad calls by referees both.
Language Log notes that vuvuzela "is woth 23 scrabble points even before bonuses — or would be, if it were added to the official word list."
Mark Gleeson at Reuters blog thinks that in the end money will talk louder than any vuvuzela.
He says that the debate around the vuvuzela has become "almost a neo-colonial conflict":
The debate around the vuvuzela was always going to generate big noise but for some South African commentators it has become almost a neo-colonial conflict.
The noisy trumpet, which dominates the sound waves around the stadiums during the Confederations Cup, has got a lot of people covering their ears.
Complaints from TV viewers across Europe have been vociferous enough for the future of the plastic pest to become the major item on the agenda at the series of press conferences FIFA president Sepp Blatter has held during the tournament in South Africa.
At the end the day, it is the big TV money that talks.
If the world’s broadcasters feel the cacophony of vuvuzelas detracts from the viewing pleasure of their public, FIFA will be forced to back down and ban the trumpets from the 2010 World Cup stadiums.
It won’t have anything to do with any ‘ism, just cold hard cash.
Bob of the unofficial blog of DC United does not understand the vuvuzela haters:
I personally don't understand the vuvuzela haters.
I guess some people have no ability to filter out these quiet buzzing sounds from the ubiquitous noisemakers in the stands during the Confederations Cup matches.
Apparently, they are called vuvuzelas.
I want one.
From the very first seconds of the very first Confederations Cup match that I watched this year, New Zealand v Spain, I thought, "what is that interesting sound?" and then promptly filtered it out.
In a similar way, when I lived in Rosslyn, under the flight path of the planes approaching National Airport, the noisy planes bothered me for about a week.
Then I didn't hear it anymore.
Anyone who has been to a live soccer match knows that it is an event of experiences.
There is the game itself, but there are songs, Roman Candles, smoke bombs, drums, horns.
Oh yeah, and drunk supporters too.
Some of his readers disagree.
One of them hates "the damn thing" because it destroys the game atmosphere:
I'm one of the haters, and I can't comprehend someone who actually enjoys watching soccer on TV liking them.
I hate the damn things.
But it's not because they're loud and annoying.
It's not because they're loud and annoying.
It's because they absolutely, completely, utterly destroy the game-related atmosphere at the matches.
Destroy it.
Another reader says, "it's insane":
*You* may have some wonderful ability to push it into your mental background, but for most of us, it's insane.
The sound is *not* "atmospheric", it is *not* a minor part of the viewing experience, and it is *not* acceptable.
Setumo writes about the vuvuzela and intolerance:
For the record, we do not blow the vuvuzela because we are Africans.
We blow the vuvuzela because we get an adrenalin rush from the creative noise it makes.
Also, we get an adrenalin rush because we are human.
Not because we are Africans!
Now that we have moved away from the racial stereotype, it becomes easier to clear the noise.
Subsequently, we could agree in unison that this is a matter of like, dislike and intolerance.
One of Setumo's readers argues that World Cup is not and "African" thing:
So the Vuvu is an African thing??
The FIFA 2010 fiasco is not an “African” thing .. it is an international thing.
The fact is that SA is only hosting the tourno, and trying hard to get as many international visitors to SA next year.
So, have a bit of understanding that most non-Africans find the V-noise irritating in the extreme.
Another reader likes the sound so much and would even buy vuvuzela ringtone!:
@mcOlly - As a Texan, I would totally buy that ringtone.
All this uproar over the vuvuzela is silly.
If it doesn’t sound nice on TV, then the broadcasters should turn the stadium mics down.
I just learned of the vuvuzela by watching the Confederations Cup, and it makes me want to go to the WC even more.
Shine2010 thinks that vuvuzelas will teach the world tolerance and respect:
...maybe an encounter with a few thousand vuvuzelas will force the world, and soccer, to actually adopt some of the ideals – tolerance, respect, etc. – that it constantly preaches.
Robyn has become a vuvuzela addict:
I first tried to blow a vuvuzela two weeks ago, at the start of the Confederations Cup which has been held in South Africa ahead of next year’s World Cup.
I failed miserably.
I blew and I blew and nothing happened, just a few insipid little parps.
But at the Brazil vs. Italy game, I got the hang of the vuvuzela and quickly joined the crowd in a jaunty one-note tune.
Baaaah!
Baaah!
Baaah!
It is a sound so irritating and so obnoxious that it’s best to stick with the maxim “if you can’t beat ‘em, join em.”
Not blowing a vuvuzela at a South African football game not only makes you feel a bit left out but it also makes you resent the noise everyone else it making.
I Luv SA has a piece of advice for vuvuzela haters, "Suck it up":
Me, I'd say to Fifa, you bought the spiel to host the cup in South Africa, you get to eat up the whole enchilada which includes the main ingredient, the vuvuzela.
It's like telling English fans to shut the irritating background drone they call singing.
Suck it up.
"Critics are saying they are too noisy.
I say so what?," writes Ash on South Africa Football Fans blog:
That is the purpose of the Vuvuzela after all.
It is there to get the atmosphere buzzzzing.
This is Africa and we are renowned for dancing and singing and generally creating a great vibe at our football matches.
It’s all part of the uniquely South African experience and I’m certain that if our foreign visitors attend the games and experience the electrifying atmosphere they will fall in love with the Vuvuzela.
To me asking the local supporters to leave their Vuvuzela’s at home would be like asking the Liverpool fans not to sing You'll Never Walk Alone, or asking the Brazilian fans not to create the Samba atmosphere at their matches.
"What happened to dancing and singing and costumes?," one reader asks and adds, "Don't let your only contribution to the world be an almost universally annoying one! ":
If that is the only culture South Africa has to share, that is pretty bad.
Whatever happened to dancing and singing and costumes?
Seems to work for other countries just fine. Don't let your only contribution to the world be an almost universally annoying one!
It's a question of hospitality too.
Blasting noise in our ears is just plain rude.
I for one am turning the sound off.
I feel sorry for anyone travelling to SA to watch the games.
They have no choice in the matter.
Another reader compares the vuvuzela sound to "an annoying swarm of bees buzzing around your head...":
The argument the blogger is making about comparing Liverpool songs and Brazil's samba atmosphere borders on retarded.
I would certainly ask a Liverpool fan to stop if they just screamed one note of YWNWA in my ear for an hour and a half.
There is a big difference between an annoying swarm of bees buzzing around your head a samba dance.
"You won't be watching your local teams or players," another reader responds:
How is South Africa telling the world that they are football visitors?
Visitors to the country yes.
Visitors to football?
Don't make me laugh.
This is not South African football next year.
It's world football in South Africa.
You won't be watching your local teams or players.
Anders tells us that vuvuzela haters are the people who were watching the games on TV:
The vuvuzela outcry is mainly coming from those, like my friend, who are watching the tournament abroad.
In the stadium, the fans love them.
It's one of those things you bemoan until you actually are able to try it: think laser pointer.
On TV the horns conflict with the commentary, among other things, but in the ground the ambient noise is part of the atmosphere.
It is undoubtedly less abrasive in person than it is via satellite.
The real vuvuzela war, we are told, is not on the Internet but in the Netherlands:
There is a real Vuvuzela war threat in the Netherlands.
The company SoccerID reported Monday to import the controversial South African horn to Europe.
Within three to four weeks the first Vuvuzela's should be for sale in the Netherlands.
NoLimitation however, claims to have exclusive distribution rights for the Vuvuzela.
NoLimitation BV acquired the exclusive rights to the Vuvuzela and use of the name through Urbas Kehrberg GmbH, the German company which claims to have the rights to all EU countries.
This means that, according NoLimitation, they are the only company in the Netherlands with the right to sell the three-piece horn under the name Vuvuzela.
Chris of World Cup blog agrees that the vuvuzela is "quintessentially South African" but...
Problem is, it’s also quintessentially obnoxious.
If you’ve watched even 30 seconds of a Confederations Cup, you’ve surely noticed the all-enveloping buzzing sound - and chances are those horns are the reason you only watched 30 seconds.
it’s just one long 90 minute droning sound. To the point you begin to wonder when the B-list horror movie is going to break out before your eyes.
I’ve personally begun watching the games on mute - what with the combination of ESPN’s commentary team and the vuvuzela capable of being substituted for lethal injection and all.
Phobian suggests that the vuvuzela be allowed when South Africa plays:
The World Cup is for everyone, not just the Vuvuzela blowers.
Maybe they should only be allowed at games where SA plays.
The other soccer teams playing should also have some say in whether there should be Vuvuzelas or not at their games.
SA Sucks takes the vuvuzela debate to a totally new ground by arguing that apart from the possibility of damaging one's hearing, the instrument might spread HIV/AIDS!
Medical experts are issuing warnings that the noise from a vuvuzela can permanently damage a person’s hearing, but that’s never mind the HIV/ AIDS dangers of this thing.
From last week’s Confederations Cup matches, spectators were blasted from all directions by the earth-shattering noise of the vuvuzela. In addition to the health hazards of ringing ears and thundering headaches, a by-product of mindlessly blowing on this instrument is the accumulation of a huge amount of saliva.
The vuvuzela is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the "Sub-Saharan Africoon":
Personally, I love it!
If anything is going to bring the World Cup 2010 down, and become a symbol of everything that is wrong with the sub-Saharan Africoon, it will be the damned vuvuzela.
Just think how the filth, squalor, violent ape-like behaviour and deafening racket this thing produces will be beamed into 500 million White Western homes, for all the world to see.
SA Sucks warns World Cup visitors to prepare for an anthropological “baptism of fire."
The blogger experienced himself "three hours of hell on earth":
But on Sunday I was subjected to more than three hours of this hell on earth.I vowed, then and there, that after that first (and only) evening of the authentic South African soccer experience, I would never ever allow myself to be subjected to it again.
There were many things amiss that left me disappointed and angry that evening, but none so offensive to my senses as the Vuvuzela.
"If FIFA were to ban the vuvuzela then they may as well scrap the rotation policy of the World Cup and just stage it every year in Europe at times that suit the Europeans and with a European atmosphere at the stadia," writes Visual Guidance:
Of course, there has to be something to moan about though.
No complaints from the people at the stadium.
They love it.
No, it is the sofa slobs thousands of miles away, slouched in front of their TV and whining that the noise is giving them a headache.
Boo hoo.
Answer me this – are the horns any more annoying than the Ultras with mega-phones at partisan stadia across the peninsula or the England Band droning out ‘The Great Escape’ constantly at Wembley?
This tournament is being played in Africa.
This is what they do at football games in their country, it’s their football culture.
If FIFA were to ban the vuvuzela then they may as well scrap the rotation policy of the World Cup and just stage it every year in Europe at times that suit the Europeans and with a European atmosphere at the stadia.
Garreth finds the vuvuzela's noise awful and horrifying but feels that the global football community needs to explore new footballing cultures:
Even though the noise is awful (horrifying really) I’m inclined to agree with the SAFA on this one.
As much as the World Cup is about football it is also about the global football community and exploring new footballing cultures.
If I’m starting to sound a bit like a hippy here I’m sorry, but it generally is the way I feel.
The vuvuzela sound is annoying and that is why walls of Jericho fell!:
The sound is annoying!
That’s why the walls of Jericho fell!
The people of Jericho broke the walls down on themselves to escape the blaring!
Death was the sweeter option.
Now, as for those South African fans, they are ALL LUNGS!
Don’t they realize the commotion they’re creating?
I’m fully aware that it is the country’s soccer culture, but it has to be done away with! Nobody will buy a ticket to have some guy blow the crap out of a vuvuzela throughout the match!
Cape Town Daily Photo does not think the noise was all that bad:
I’ve never been a fan of the vuvuzela (that long plastic trumpet that South African supporters blow at soccer matches), but to be honest, it really wasn’t so bad.
They weren’t too loud and I have to say that they did add to the atmosphere significantly.
They are an integral part of South African soccer culture and it just wouldn’t be the same without them.
Getting ready for World Cup 2010?:
Buy ear plugs from a music store - you’ll still be able to enjoy the atmosphere, even if you find a vuvuzela positioned right next to your ear.
If you are a fan of vuvuzela, you can visit Blow Me website to blow the virtual vuvuzela.
"Ever wanted to ask our Son from Nyangoma any questions?
In other words, would you like the American president, Barack Obama to answer your questions?," begins a post at Hot Secrets blog about Obama's use of new media to engage in a conversation with ordinary Africans.
Barack Obama is visiting Ghana on 10-11 July.
This will be his first historic visit to Sub-Saharan Africa and will use tools such as Twitter, Facebook and SMS to speak directly to Africans.
Erik Hersman who blogs at White African, discusses media platforms Obama intends to use to reach out to Africans beyond Ghana.
Erik worked with the White House in developing their new media strategy for Ghana and Africa.
He writes:
Radio is still the number one communications medium across Africa, and Ghana has a particularly vibrant and active one with a lot of local and national community interaction.
As everyone knows, mobile phone penetration has grown at an explosive rate in Africa, this means that SMS is a fairly democratic means for getting feedback from people of every demographic across the nation. (Funnily enough, not available to US-based residents – more below on that)
Lastly, there are no major homegrown web-based social networks in Ghana, and like many other countries across Africa Facebook has a decent amount of penetration.
In Ghana, it’s at 100,000+, so it makes the most sense for the new media team to engage and interact without splitting their energy over too many services.
Having Twitter on as a backup is natural, as there will be a great deal of chatter there as well.
He posts details from the White House:
SMS.
We’re launching an SMS platform to allow citizens to submit questions, comments and words of welcome (in English and in French) .
Using a local SMS short code in Ghana (1731) , Nigeria (32969) , South Africa (31958) and Kenya (5683), as well as a long code across the rest of the world*, Africans and citizens worldwide will be encouraged to text their messages to the President.
SMS participants will also be able to subscribe to speech highlights in English and French.
Long numbers for mobile registration pan-Africa: 61418601934 and 45609910343.
Radio.
A live audio stream of the President’s speech will be pushed to national and local radio stations during the speech.
After the speech, a taped audio recording of the President’s answers to the SMS messages received will be made available to radio stations and websites.
The President hopes to answer a variety of questions and comments by topic and region.
The audio recording will also be made available for download on White House website and iTunes.
Video.
The speech will be livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live.
The embed code for this video is available so you may also host the livestream on any Website.
Online chat.
We will host a live web chat around the speech on Facebook (it will be at http://apps.facebook.com/whitehouselive).
The White House will also create a Facebook “event” around the speech wherein participants from around the world can engage with one another.
A Twitter hashtag (i.e. #obamaghana) will also be created and promoted to consolidate input and reaction around the event.
Internet users can also submit questions to AllAfrica website:
Your chance to query President Obama about Africa:
What do you want to ask President Obama as he prepares to visit sub-Saharan Africa for the first time as leader of the United States - a stop in Ghana on 10-11 July?
Write your question here, and we will compile your submissions.
Please, if you would, include your age and your occupation.
According to Michael Wilkerson who writes at Foreign Policy blog, Obama's use of new media might boost his global approval ratings:
With no glitches, this demonstration of interest in the views of Africans will probably boost Obama's global approval ratings, which already are almost double those of the United States.
At Accra's tourist market, Obama t-shirts and paintings are flying off the shelves and Ghanaians are hoping for a boost in tourism after the visit.
Ghana Pundit reports that thousands of text messages have been sent to Obama:
US President Barack Obama has received thousands of text messages about Africa after he asked people to send questions before his trip to Ghana on Friday.

The death of American pop star Michael Jackson has sparked an outpouring of emotion from nearly every corner of the world.
Fans are sharing their memories of Jackson on his official site in nearly a dozen languages, and the news made the front page of papers across the globe.
In Africa, bloggers are paying tribute to the King of Pop by posting pictures and music videos.
Writing from Nigeria, Oluniyi David Ajao offers a list of his 26 favorite Michael Jackson songs, while Ugandan blogger Serakelz honors Jackson's memory with instructions on how to do the moonwalk, a dance move created by Jackson.
In Ghana, Kent Mensah of Africa News collects reactions to Jackson's passing on Twitter and Facebook:
“Africa loves Michael Jackson... from birth you learn how to survive and that Michael Jackson is music... the most famous musician ever,” Rasco Patterson said on twitter @chickenwang4.
“Make this world a better place for me and you these are the words from a true legend like Michael Jackson.
I will always remember you Waco Jaco,” Elton Afari, Accra, Ghana said on Facebook.
Echoing the sentiments of many African fans, Sudanese Thinker remembers the pop star fondly:
In a lot of ways Michael Jackson was my childhood.
His music filled it with lots of joy and beautiful memories.
It uplifted me when I was down.
It made me happy when I was sad.
And as awkward and flawed as he was, I will dearly miss him and his talents.
And Ugandan blogger Dickson Wasake honors Jackson with a poem:
On the death of Michael Jackson;
The tears fill the earth,
Black or white;
The Liberian girl cries,
And so does dirty Diana,
even the stranger in Moscow,
We all scream;
“Oh it’s too bad; oh it’s too sad;
The king is gone too soon,
And I just can’t stop loving him!”
Though many bloggers are grieving over Jackson's death, others are questioning his eccentricities, including his changing skin color.
In Ghana, blogger Emmanuel Bensa laments:
....the African culture tells us that we don't speak ill of the dead-and I am not about to do so anytime soon, but what I will do is to categorically state how much of a bad decision it was to become a white man.
Black is beautiful-and it will forever be so.
As a Black Man, Michael Jackson had the looks, the voice; the talent.
Oh what a shame.
For Ugandan blogger Rosebell, Jackson's death prompted reflections on why the news pays so much more attention to the death of a pop star than to other tragedies:
As I watched the reaction around the world to Jackson’s death I wondered if really all humans can ever be equal.
Not that I don’t recognise MJ’s contribution to music and his great talent, I would be naïve to do so, but I wonder why we no longer get the shock when we see death around the world.
Everyone seemed to say oh he died young at 50, and then I thought that actually in Uganda life expectancy is at 50. Do you know in many African countries dying of old age is almost history?
Do you know that this shock we feel at the loss MJ’s death, many Iraqis face it everyday?
The fear for the loss of their own lives and the puzzles of how their children will grow, grips people in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Omar Basawad of Safari Notes dismisses these criticisms, focusing on Jackson's legendary talent:
Whatever might be said about Michael Jackson, whatever one might think of him - one thing is certain: he defined an era.
"RIP MJ," writes Kenyan blogger WildeYearnings.
"You now have the whole sky to moonwalk on..."
U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech in Ghana which could be considered as his Africa policy speech.
Cameroonians at home and in the diaspora have been reacting to the words pronounced by the American leader with African roots via the blogosphere.
The speech was published in its entirety on Up Station Mount Club which is fledgling one-stop-shop of Anglophone Cameroonian blogging.
The comments give the impressions of a people appreciative of the bright speech but wary of rhetoric.
Augustine S, a Cameroonian based in Canada seems pleased with the speech's direct attack on corruption and bad governance but wants more:
Speech well delivered.
It was above expectations.
He struck on corruption and good governance, what i wanted to hear.
African leaders are stifling the progress of their own nations.
I wish his administration goes a long way to exposing corrupt African leaders, punish them by freezing their assets and issuing traveling bans on them and their families.
Obama is the kind of leader we need in this world.
Still on the issue of tackling corruption and embezzlement by African leaders Oyez has some advice to western leaders like Obama:
Just two more things are required, and it will go a long way:
1) Deny African rulers, their families and their lieutenants the right to foreign bank accounts and foreign property of any kind.
2) Deny African rulers any kind of medical care outside of Africa.
Those are the only two things we ask the West to do, and we will take care of the rest.
A comment left by Nnokko Johnson brings the Obama speech to Cameroon's door-steps by reminding the country's President, Paul Biya, who has been in power since 1982 and in 2008 oversaw the amendment of the constitution to cancel limitation of presidential terms:
Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.
MR Biya please take note of this phrase and learn,we dont want u out,but we need strong institutions,please please...
However, reading from many of the comments posted one may come out with the view that Cameroonians see Obama's speech as "good talking" that cannot solve their problems.
Emmanuel says:
Home run.
Talk, talk, talk, all of it old crap, and ghoulish, to boot.
It does take two to tango. And, Africans are silly to listen to lectures on corruption from the leader of the hegemon of financial, moral and political corruption; it took two to tango with the slave trade, colonialism, and now the era of "partnership."
Look, this talk of "partnership" is a lie.
Only subststantive, not notional equals, can enter into partnerships.
Reex adds:
The same rhetoric... I wonder when people stop believing and start acting... We don't need speeches on hope and pledges -they serve to anesthetize the population, that their problems shall be solved -they should hope for the solutions.
When the financial crisis hit the US, the President said something similar about the responsibility of Americans to take the charge...Well contri pipo, most Americans are not even in control of their financial lives, lest responsible for the financial collapse, which were created by a greedy clique of bankers....
Well, Obama's speeches are well-written by an impressive staff to do a formidable job.
What else do we expect from him?
Speeches from his heart about the realities of our current world?
The trend of thought seems to be that, it is for Africans to solve their own problems.
As Reex says,
...let us Africans work out our solutions.
We may afterward invite Obama to share roasted corn and groundnuts at the fire side and discuss the politics on the ground - neither Ivy League stuff nor the usual double-talk demonstrated by the Western World, those speeches could be reserved to later occasions, when every hungry stomach in Africa has been filled!
A comment from a visitor called Isat is less diplomatic:
What we should really keep as a reminder are these words:"Africa's future is up to Africans."
And take note: Obama is not African.
His grand-father who cooked for the Brits and his father were Africans.
He is American and his country's interests rule supreme - no matter how many songs we sing in his praise.
Man wey yi get ear make yi hear.
The Up Station Mountain Club, collective blog also carries a post - Barack Obama in Africa: "Beyond Yes We Can", yes we must, from Cameroonian blogger Aloysius Agendia in which he exhorts Africans to make a change:
Yes, Africa can revolt against current misleading leadership and their shady deals that have impoverished the continent.
Beyond the yes, we can, yes, we must implement the said changes to move forward
This blog also gives a rythmic flavour to this visit as the video of a Cameroonian musician hailing Barack Obama on his election is posted there.
The song was released by Tata Kingue just before Obama's inauguration in January 2009 and Gef's Outlook had done a small translation at the time.
On Sunday July 12th, people in the Republic of the Congo voted in an election which opposition leaders boycotted over allegations it would be neither free nor fair.
Denis Sassou N’Guesso, who has ruled the Congo for about 25 years as head of state, is seeking another seven year term in power.
Despite protests from the opposition, election observers said the voting was peaceful, and that voter turnout was low.
According to the main opposition, "90 per cent" of the country’s electorate did not go to the polls.
Outgoing President Denis Sassou N’Guesso and his Rassemblement de la majorité présidentielle (RMP) is widely tipped to win the elections as the country’s electoral commission prepares to announce the results anytime from Monday evening.
A BBC correspondent reportedly witnessed "money being handed out at a polling station in the south of the capital, to people who later said they had been asked to vote for Mr Sassou-Nguesso."
One election observer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Agence France Presse, "There are more observers than voters."
At the French news site France 24, a few commenters from Congo have expressed their opinions on the election.
Below is a selection of a few of them:
Maloumbi on voter intimidation:
Swine flu or H1N1 is still making headlines across the Arab world as new cases continue to be discovered by health authorities and announced in the Press on a daily basis.
In Bahrain, Silly Bahraini Girl (which is me) is back home and surprised at what she saw at her country's airport:
Reality of how mad this place has become smacks you in the face the second you land at the Bahrain International Airport and see all the ground staff wearing surgical masks, from the ground handling staff to the immigration and customs officers.
"What's wrong with you?"
I ask them.
"Is there a plague in Bahrain?"
I continue questioning the situation seemed tense and and the level of swine madness was certainly the highest I have come across everywhere I have travelled through since pig mania gripped Planet Earth.
Why wasn't there a single person wearing a mask at the airports of San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto and Heathrow which I have travelled
through over the past few weeks?
Still in Bahrain, Sohail Al Gosaibi smells a conspiracy in the air, noting that exaggerating the effect of swine flu benefits the media, advertising and pharmaceutical industries.
The Saudi blogger writes:
The media almost always exaggerate the situation, remember that fears sells.
And newspapers and news channels have to sell advertising space and airtime to make money, and the more shocking and scary their stories, the more viewers and readers they have, which leads to more advertisers, and more profits.
Al Gosaibi also quotes an article he has read and concludes:
According to the article, the US and UK governments have billions of dollars worth of Tamifluiflu stock that they must use within the next few months, or they’ll expire.
Interesting, huh?
And speaking of theories, Jordan Reform Watch also has something up his sleeve and writes:
Ahhh..The swine-flu with all the accompanying conspiracy theories..A Jordanian “Scientist” specializing in diseases claims that Mecca And Medina are somehow isolated from disease, thus there is no need for the talk about the possible outbreaks that might result from the millions of pilgrims being in extreme proximity while performing Hajj.. Kill them Pigs..Go To hajj..You will be disease free..
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia, who blogs at Egyptian Chronicles, is also concerned about how the disease will spread during the Hajj , where millions of pilgrims from around the world converge to Mecca to perform the ritual.
She notes:
the discussion about the future of Pilgrimage "Hij" and Omra this year is still debatable.
The minister of health wants to cancel Omra where as the minister of tourism is against the cancellation , I do not need to speak about Pilgrimage.
Of course the debate is much hotter among the clerics themselves.
Saudi Arabia understands the challenge it is facing already and decided to deal with the situation as much as it can in the Omra and pilgrimage , it recommends that pregenant women , elderly and kids to avoid pilgrimage this year , I really respect this move.
I also have a better suggestion.
In such circumstances why not to limit Omra and pilgrimage for the first time pilgrims only from men and women
Our final stop is in Syria, where blogger Yaser Arwani links to a news story which says that Syria's first swine flu case was recently reported in a Syrian doctor, who works in Australia and was on a visit to her country.
The female doctor travelled to Syria through Dubai International Airport and the disease was not detected until a few days after her arrival.
Tshering Tobgay, the Leader of the opposition party in the National Assembly of Bhutan, comments that: "the transition to our democracy has, indeed, been uniquely smooth.
So smooth that most of us weren’t even paying attention."
Sina Vann was 13 when she came to Cambodia from Vietnam on what was supposed to be a vacation.
Instead, she was sold as a sex slave and spent the next two years in a brothel.
She was freed when Somaly Mam, an anti-slavery activist and the face of the Somaly Mam Foundation, organized a raid on Vann's brothel.
Today, Vann is an activist with the Somaly Mam Foundation, helping fellow survivors of slavery as well as those still working in brothels.
For Vann's work, she was honored with the Frederick Douglass Award.
The Frederick Douglass Award "honors the tremendous resilience of the human spirit and emphasizes that many of the survivors of modern-day slavery go on to help others to freedom."
More of Vann's story is revealed in this video:
2009 Frederick Douglass Award Winner - Sina Vann from Free the Slaves on Vimeo.
Recently, the United Nations granted a one-year extension on its mandate addressing the humans rights situation in Cambodia.
According to The Mirror, the U.N. Special Rapporteur, reporting to the Human Rights Council:
expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Cambodia.
According to his report, the rule of law in Cambodia is weak...Also, he mentioned the case of a Sam Rainsy Party parliamentarian – from the biggest opposition party in Cambodia – Ms. Mu Sochua, who had been sentenced by a court, controlled by the government of the Cambodian People’s Party, to lose her case unjustly, because she had dared to protest against the powerful in Cambodia.
Others urged the Special Rapporteur not to forget about the women and children who remain victims of sexual slavery in Cambodia, noting that it must remain a human rights priority even as other human rights violations, such as freedom of expression, surface.
A selection of books from and about the Caribbean.

The anglophone Caribbean's small but energetic literary blogosphere has taken notice of a new arrival to its conversation.
Caribbean Book Blog, created by the St. Lucian journalist Tony Williams, aims to "inform writers and readers about the latest developments in the international book trade and how they are likely affect the literary communities in the Caribbean and other small-island states."
Since launching on 11 October, 2009, Caribbean Book Blog has posted a series of thoughtful, statistics-laden essays on the issues facing Caribbean publishers, writers, and readers, at a time when literary publishing around the world is grappling with financial hardship and technological change.
Williams's posts have provoked thought and discussion both in the blog's comments fields and elsewhere.
Caribbean Book Blog began with an essay titled "Breaking the Shackles", analysing the state of Caribbean publishing and the market for Caribbean books.
Otherwise we may well be faced with a situation where our literary griots end up being relegated to a state of obscurity and irrelevance.
To avoid this they must find new mediums to draw attention to themselves and their work.
In his second essay, "Now Is the Time", Williams proposes that "a group of intellectual, editorial and IT visionaries with ... pioneering spirit and the entrepreneurial drive" ought to "take up the challenge of creating an online home for our struggling writers and poets to help them stand on their feet so they in turn can help usher in a new dawn of knowledge and enlightenment."
Several writers based in the Caribbean have joined the discussion by leaving comments.
Antiguan novelist Joanne C. Hillhouse writes:
It does take away from the time and energy I have to give to my writing, and I’m still working on finding that balance, but I’ve come to terms with the fact that self-promotion (ugly word) is part of the process and the Internet is in many ways leveling the playing field.
Jamaican poet Tanya Shirley echoes these sentiments:
I think as Caribbean writers we are now living in an age where we have to be more proactive in the process of marketing our work and using all the resources at our disposal to do so.
What is needed is a web site that is devoted full-time to Caribbean writing.
The site as I envision it would be a clearing house for books published by Caribbean writers.
Publishers would submit their catalogues, writers could upload their photos and reading dates, and readers could subscribe via RSS, newsletters, or email.
Philp also lists well over a dozen Caribbean literary and scholarly journals online, some of them traditional printed journals that also maintain a web presence, and some entirely web-based.
Together with a few dedicated litbloggers and writers-who-blog, these sites, Philp suggests, could evolve into the nucleus of a future web-based Caribbean publishing community.
In the three and a half years since Global Voices last comprehensively surveyed the Caribbean literary blogosphere, a handful of new journals has emerged, based online and in many cases using blogging software to publish quickly and inexpensively. tongues of the ocean, based in the Bahamas and running on WordPress, was launched in early 2009 as a poetry journal, but by its third issue it also included short fiction.
Editor Nicolette Bethel (who also writes at her personal blog) in an interview with Antilles, the blog of the Caribbean Review of Books, described being inspired by online journals based in other parts of the world:
I was impressed by these journals’ integration of media into their offerings, which made them a substantially different, more alive, animal from the printed page.
What was missing among them?
An online Caribbean journal for Caribbean writers with the kind of turn-around and quick publishing record that these other online journals had.
In mid-2009 another blog-based magazine project went live: Zafra Lit, which translates short fiction by contemporary Cuban writers into English.
Edited by David Iaconangelo, a student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and running on Blogger, Zafra Lit draws on the efforts of student translators who volunteer their time and skills.
An even more recent arrival is Town, launched in October 2009.
At Tallawah, Jamaican journalist Tyrone S. Reid posts reviews and articles covering books, music, art, and film, in an effort to "help facilitate constructive discussion."
And PLEASURE, a new blog by Trinidadian writer Andre Bagoo (who also has a personal blog, Tattoo), covers "art in all its forms", including a recently launched interview series which began with UK-based Trinidadian poet Vahni Capildeo.
The most energetic recent arrival in the Caribbean online literary scene may be Repeating Islands, an arts and culture blog run by two literary scholars with roots in Puerto Rico, Ivette Romero-Cesareo and Lisa Paravisini-Gebert.
Covering literature, visual arts, music, performance, cultural studies, and more, Repeating Islands posts up to six or seven new items daily: links to articles and interviews, information about new books and exhibitions, and fascinating oddments.
An online writing and publishing network like the one Caribbean Book Blog and Geoffrey Philp imagine will need this kind of breadth and enthusiasm.
A foreign man who spent the last seven months in the Beijing No. 1 Detention Center sent DANWEI a detailed account of his daily life in Jail.
This month, the Chinese press and online forums are saturated with coverage of Charles Kao’s winning of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Yet another overseas Chinese scientist has snatched the prestigious prize, this temporary moment of shared glory is quickly turned into a more profound question: when would China produce its first indigenous Nobel Prize winner?
A commentary on Xinhua describes this psychology:
Blog Action Day, codenamed #bad09 by tech gurus and geeks, is an annual event that unites the world's bloggers in posting about the same issue on the same day.
The aim of the event is to raise awareness and trigger a global discussion on that particular day.
This year Blog Action Day took place on October 15, with bloggers all over the world writing on the topic of climate change.
Below is a round-up of the various posts by members of the Ghana Blogging Group on Blog Action Day.
Gameli Adzaho, author of The Gamelian World Blog, presented a post on "5 Voices on climate Change".
In it he sampled views from five global leaders.
In his opening remarks, he talked about the significance of Blog Action Day and how “the phenomenon of climate has engaged the world's attention over the past decade, provoking debates in science, politics, business and technology.”
The five global leaders he discussed were former US Vice-President Al Gore, Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai, US President Barack Obama, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Gameli ended his post with a series of questions—"What are your views on climate change?
Is it for real?
Is it a myth?
In what ways do you think that the world can use its resources more sustainably?
Can developing countries contribute to reversing climate change?"—to which he hopes to get to answers to soon.
Next to post on Blog Action Day was The African Women’s Development Fund (AWDF) whose contributors are AWDF, Bisi and Roselyn.
Their post related to "Climate Change and Women".
AWDF is an Africa-wide grant-making foundation for African Women.
The vision of the AWDF is for African women to live in a world in which there is social justice, equality and respect for women’s human rights.
They started their post by taking issue with statements made by Arun Agrawal in his paper on Social Dimensions of Climate Change, which was prepared for the Social Development Department, The World Bank, Washington DC, March 5-6, 2008.
In his paper, Agrawal stated that “climate change will be pivotal in redefining development in the twenty-first century.
How nations, societies, communities, and households respond to the impacts of climate changes and variability to which the world has already been committed will in many instances determine their prospects for growth, equity, and sustainability”.
AWDF views climate change as an environmental change, which is also driven by humans—fundamentally a human problem.
The impacts of climate change are expected to seriously (and disproportionately) affect the livelihoods, health, and educational opportunities of people living in poverty.
AWDF also made a few recommendations for dealing with the situation.
Kajsa Hallberg Adu, co-founder of Ghana Blogging Group and author of the Rain In Africa blog, had a lot to say on Blog Action Day, but was shocked at "how not current the topic is in Ghana".
Kajsa laments the absence of Ghana from a web site counting down to the UN Climate Change Summit and asks: "Really, when was the last time you heard someone discuss climate change around here?"
Yet Ghana came in for some special praise from Kasja:
A way to globally reduce the carbon dioxide emissions is to make sure we travel with public transport rather than individually in our own cars.
Today, many Ghanaians travel in packed trotros, shared taxis or "Kufuor busses" and hence do not emit too much CO2.
Can we say the same about the North/West?
But as Ghanaians grow richer - our goal is to become a middle income country as soon as possible - more Ghanaians can also afford their own cars.
In my opinion the problem in the discussion about climate change is that while developed countries are struggling to be sustainable, developing countries are already klimatsmarta, but not by choice.
Rather the "environmental consciousness" or sustainable living is caused by last year's topic; poverty.
Finally, Edward Tagoe, author of Tagoe Blogger blog and also a software developer-cum-poet, decided to share with his readers an interesting website called YOURENEW.COM. According to Edward, the site "is the perfect place for you to recycle or sell used cell phones, mp3 players, digital cameras and graphing calculators.
You can also recycle and sell laptops, video game console, external hard drive, video game or DVD.
If you can’t find your device in our catalogue or we can’t pay for it, you can always ship it for free and we’ll recycle it safely.
So look up your device today, go green and get green!
So look up your device today and go green!"
Also take note, October 24th, 2009 has been designated the International Day of Climate Action by 350.org.

According to OECD figures , Japan has one of the highest poverty rates in the developed world and is 4th after only Mexico, Turkey and the U.S.

In September, Makoto Yuasa, Secretary-general of Anti Poverty Network (反貧困 Han Hinkon) , had already pointed to the problem explaining Japan's poverty issue in this way :
Ever since the high economic growth of the 1960s, Japan has inhabited the myth that all Japanese people belong to the middle class.
However, Japanese-style employment, which is at the heart of this myth, has been transformed by the increase in nonregular employment and other factors, and a growing number of Japanese live in poverty.
As many debate on their blogs, nowadays the income gap in Japan is far from being new.
When the economic Bubble burst in the early 90s it revealed the weaknesses in the Japanese system and since then many experts say the country has never completely recovered from recession.
Ysaki suggests how this problem has always existed but have been regarded by most Japanese as a somebody else's problem.
Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak introduced the One Malaysia concept, popularly referred as 1Malaysia, when he took office.
Being a multi-racial country, the main aim of 1Malaysia is to promote national unity and to strengthen the ties between various ethnic groups.
1Toilet policy is based on the 1Malaysia concept
Borrowing the branding of 1Malaysia, the state government of Terengganu recently introduces the '1Toilet' policy as a move for both teachers and students (of the same gender) to share toilets to promote a sense of oneness.
“When students share the toilets with the teacher, they (students) will believe that they are on par with academicians and this automatically invokes a sense of being important to an organisation, which, in this case, is the school,” says State Education, Higher Learning, Human Resource, Science and Technology Committee chairman Ahmad Razif Abd Rahman in local daily The Star.
The policy will also extend beyond the loo as teachers are also encouraged to eat at the school’s cafeteria with the students.
It is a way for both parties to mingle during recess.
There were mixed reactions from the blogosphere regarding this topic.
Some took it as a joke, while others thought it was a positive initiative.
Jeff Ooi, who is a prominent blogger and now a Member of Parliament says:
This time, 1Malaysia's product extension is where you pee.
Life And Ti(m)es Of Liang Seng could not believe that the state government is actually introducing the 1Toilet concept:
I would understand the sharing of canteen part.
But to share toilet to instill a sense of belonging and create excellence?
Come on.
We can do better.
Journalist, blogger and Global Voices author Niki Cheong writes in his personal blog:
Which nutcase came up with this brilliant idea I think sharing a toilet with the teacher won’t help a student excel in his or her studies, proper teaching will!
What’s the heck is going on?
Are we going to have to start eating 1ton mee after this?
Or only listen to 1Buck Short?
Or are we going to get people registering names like 1Sharina for birth certificates?
Thots Here And There believes that leaders should walk the talk before implementing any policies:
Why don't we start with the elite groups first before going to the majority?
In my school, the upper crust get a special key to their own special toilet I know in certain companies in the private sectors there is such a privilege too.
I remember a friend being all excited because he had reached that privileged level of having his own key to that special place!
Now, if we want to implement such a thing as 1toilet in school - imagine queueing up with the students to use the toilet - let us start with the upper level of administrators first.
Leaders talk about 1Malaysia...come on, walk the talk.
Show us, leaders of Malaysia that we are one in all ways inclusive in the use of toilet!!!!
Voices Inside My Head explains the positive aspect of the 1Toilet policy:
When I was in school I did wonder the same thing, how come teachers get to pee in seperate toilets.
Do they pee differently?
Do they have something else we don’t have?
I think it should be done across the board, even at work places top management sharing the same toilets!
Perhaps even ministers should share the same toilets as other government staff and that’s when I would really say our politicians are walking the talk!
This author, via his personal blog, says:
Teachers should also lead by example and getting the best from their students.
If a student is already having an inferiority complex feeling in the classroom, how can he/she invoke a sense of importance with the 1Toilet policy?
Do we have to share the toilet to have a feeling of oneness between students and teachers?
Should this solidarity start in the classroom itself?
Last week, in Hammond, Louisiana, Beth Humphrey (who is white) and Terence McKay (who is black) applied for a marriage license and were refused on the basis of their races.
The justice of the peace, Keith Bardwell, claimed that in his experience, "interracial marriages do not last long" and stated that he was "doing it for the children."
"Jim Crow laws" which required separate facilities for black and white Americans ended in 1965, and anti-miscegenation laws that forbade interracial marriage or sex ended in all states by 1967.
But racism still exists.
Although much of the time it lies beneath the surface, occasionally racism rears its ugly head in a way that is impossible to miss; this story made headlines across the United States, prompting blog posts from the local community and beyond.
In response to Bardwell's "defense" that he marries black couples all the time, the anti-racist blog Stuff White People Do expressed outrage, saying:
Well, how thoroughly magnanimous of you, Justice Bardwell.
Not to mention, intrusively paternalistic.
Speaking of Bardwell's house, which I'm sure is just overrun with joyous hordes of black and white children carousing together, he also had this to say:
I have piles and piles of black friends.
They come to my home, I marry them, they use my bathroom.
I treat them just like everyone else.
Ah yes, black friends too, piles of them.
Right there, in his bathroom!
A commenter on the blog, Siditty (who also wrote her own post here), touched on the irony of Bardwell's anger:
I always wonder about a man who comes from Louisiana, who has a strong history of race mixing, through the system of placage as well as creole culture, is now all the sudden concerned about the children.
They weren't concerned in the 1700s, he shouldn't be now.
The blog Racism Review countered Bardwell's "concern for the children" with evidence on children of interracial relationships:
And, to further review the evidence, children of interracial marriages do not suffer in when compared to other children provided that they grow up in an environment that’s accepting of diversity and children of interracial marriages.
If children of interracial marriages encounter racism (and other structural disadvantages), then they’re more likely to experience stress, and health-related risks due to that increased stress, such as smoking and drinking.
That’s a result of racism, and yet another reason to work to end racism.
It should not be used – turning logic on its head – as a reason to perpetuate racism.
And Black Girl in Maine touched on the "what about the kids?" question as well, noting the experiences of her own biracial son:
As for the kids, what about the kids?
Yes, biracial kids sometimes catch flack from others but not always and I think among the youth today its almost considered cool to be biracial.
As a buddy mentioned to me my son most certainly doesn’t suffer from a lack of friends male or female.
I think the only time biracial kids have real issues is when they have no one to talk to them about their roots.
I think when kids are connected to their historical roots as well as community, it creates a safe space for them.
In the United States, anti-miscegenation laws in many states banned the marriage of white Americans to black Americans (and Americans of some other ethnicities) in a number of states.
While in some states, these laws were repealed as early as 1780, in sixteen states the laws were not repealed until a 1967 case, Loving vs. Virginia, in which an interracial couple who had married in Washington, D.C. were arrested in their own bedroom.
Their legal battle made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, at which point the laws were overturned.
A number of bloggers touched on the legal aspects of the case.
One blogger, Jay Says, writes:
As a Justice of the Peace, he should be aware that interracial marriage is not illegal anymore – having been deemed unconstitutional 40 years ago.
This particular instance hits home after this weekends National Equality March wherein I briefly interviewed an straight, interracial couple, the Newmans (pictured) about why they are marching.
Racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, religious intolerance and other biases can and do exist in our society, but they must not exist under the law.
To allow an employee of the government who is paid by the taxes of the “free” people of the United States (or in this case, a state in the United States) to use his/her own personal beliefs to decide matters governed by civil law is abhorrent.
If he doesn’t agree with interracial marriage, he needs to find a new job – perhaps Grand Master of the Ku Klux Klan?
Finally, one blogger has taken the opportunity to turn this incident into a moment of learning.
The blogger, whose blog is called What Do I Know?, begs readers to think about their own feelings on the subject:
If you doubt that racism still lives inside us all, consider your reaction to the idea of marrying outside your race, particularly if you are white and the other race is black.
Yeah, it's ok for other people, but wouldn't you find some good, rational reasons why your daughter would be making her life far more difficult when she brings home her black fiance?
Be honest.
Even if you said, "No problem" didn't you hesitate just a little?
If you didn't you're unusual.
With Bardwell now saying that he won't resign over the matter, one thing is certain: there is surely more news to come.
After seeing pictures of Cameroon's first lady, Egyptian Zeinobia remarks: "I do not how much money she spent on her hair and her looks but I know the people of Cameroon need this money more."
A campaign has been launched to end forced sterilisation in Namibia: "A coalition of civil society organisations has called on Namibians to join a campaign condemning the sterilisation of women living with HIV without their informed consent."
At Do Unto Others, Samuel Nichols writes that Israeli military patrols have started setting fire to cars which are caught trying to cross the border from the West Bank into Israel.

This is the first roundup of Somali blogs in 2009.
Yes, it's been more than a year since I took leave a long leave from blogging but now I'm back, for good.
This is the first post and expect more posts about Somali blogosphere.
Blogger Royale Somalia profiles a young female Somali doctor in Mogadishu who'd graduated last year, he writes:
In December 2008, 20 Somali students overcame huge odds and graduated from medical school in Mogadishu—the first batch to do so for almost two decades in the failed Horn of Africa state.
Dr. Hafsa Abdurrahman Mohamed, 26, was one of those receiving a diploma from the capital’s Benadir University.
Upon completing her studies, she decided to work for the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), using her skills to help provide free medical care in Somalia.
The East African Philosopher comments on Somali President Sharif Ahmed's visit to US and the US government's policy shift in dealing with Sharif:
In December of 2006 Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, currently only-in-name president of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, was on the run from the Ethiopian army, the CIA, and the U.S. Rangers.
East African Philisophers continues:
This week Sheikh Sharif is in Minneapolis, MN (and the home of this crazy congresswoman) meeting with Congressmen, Governor, and city councilmen/mayor.
Couple of months ago he had a meeting with Secretary Clinton in Nairobi during her Africa trip.
From terrorist to president for Sheikh Sharif in just two years.
That, friends, must be a first.
To me this says a lot about the U.S.’s awful foreign policy than anything else.
The Kenya Somali Blog says Somali government is recruiting Somali youth from Kenya:
Somalia's U.N.-backed government has recruited more than 170 young Kenyans and former servicemen to help it fight rebels in the failed Horn of Africa state, local leaders in eastern Kenya said.
Mohamed Gabow, the mayor of Garissa, told Reuters the enrolment of ethnic Somali Kenyans was being conducted at a home in Bulla Iftin village, on the outskirts of his town.
The recruitment is not a secret.
Those involved are not worried.
They are going around all the villages to announce the exercise," Gabow said in an interview late on Thursday.
Omar Mushawah reported the arrest of Haytham al-Maleh, a Syrian lawyer and human rights advocate who also spent 6 years in prison in the period between 1980 and 1986 for demanding constitutional reforms.
Al-Maleh is also a co-founder of the Syrian Human Rights Society.
"Trinidad and Tobago is a wealthy small island developing nation rich in oil and natural gas.

What does a woman sacrifice for the cause she fights for?
How are her children affected by persecution taken against her?
This post explores briefly the lives of women activists in Asia who are also mothers.
Irene Fernandez is a women and migrant rights activist in Malaysia.
For more than ten years, Irene has been faced with a ‘criminal defamation’ charge (which has now been dropped) for having published a memorandum, asking the Malaysian government to look into alleged atrocities taking place in migrant camps in the country.
Aside from being an activist, which had led to her receiving the Right Livelihood Award in 2005, Irene is also a mother to three children, Camverra Jose Maliamauv, Tania Jo and Katrina Jorene, and several foster children.
It is hard to imagine what goes on the mind of an activist like Irene, when she thinks of her children.
During her sentencing at the initial trial in 2003, Irene was reported to have said:
I want my children and the children of all the people I work with as head of Tenaganita to enjoy and live in a society that is peaceful, where we do not fear state violence.
Irene’s role as a mother perhaps can best be reflected in the eyes of her daughter, Katrina Jorene, who wrote on the Micah Mandate (a Christian-based blog seeking to raise public interest advocacy):
I celebrate my mother who brought me up to be constantly vigilant in life and to be clear and maddeningly persistent for the truth and for what is just, true and right.
I celebrate the countless heroes who have been present in my life especially my family members and the family at Tenaganita .
I celebrate all who have worked silently, tirelessly and with so much care all these years for the greater good of others.
It appears Irene’s teachings have caused at least one of her children to take on the same activist mantle as herself.
Now Katrina writes advocacy pieces dealing with minority rights and protection.
Unlike Katrina Jorene, unfortunately, Alexander and Kim Aris, sons of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, have not had the opportunity to learn from their mother for more than a decade.
So strong was Ms Suu Kyi’s passion for Myanmar, she has spent close to fourteen years under detention in a lakeside villa in Yangon, choosing to stay for fear that the military junta would not allow her in again if she left.
Womensphere, a blog by and about women, writes:
British husband, the Oxford scholar, Michael Aris, died of cancer in 1999 at the age of 53.
She was unable to see him as he was dying – the junta refused to give him an entry visa, and she feared that, if she left Burma, she would not be allowed back in.
She has not seen either of her two sons, now men in their thirties, for a decade.
Little has been written about (or by) Alexander or Kim.
However, in 1991, Ms Suu Kyi’s older son, Alexander, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on her behalf.
Again, looking through the lens of her child, we might be able to better understand Ms Suu Kyi as a mother:
Speaking as her son, however, I would add that I personally believe that by her own dedication and personal sacrifice she has come to be a worthy symbol through whom the plight of all the people of Burma may be recognised.
And no one must underestimate that plight.
...
We must also remember that lonely struggle taking place in a heavily guarded compound in Rangoon is part of the much larger struggle, worldwide, for the emancipation of the human spirit from political tyranny and psychological subjection.
...
Although my mother is often described as a political dissident who strives by peaceful means for democratic change, we should remember that her quest is basically spiritual.
...
It is my hope that soon my mother will be able to share this feeling and to speak directly for herself instead of through me.
Meanwhile, many activist mothers in Asia still face persecution.
For example, Fan Guijuan, whose house was said to have been demolished as a result of the Shanghai World Expo project, was arrested in Beijing and sent back to Shanghai, placed immediately in detention.
Her son has no place to live, due to the demolition.
Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Dr Edita Burgos, mother of Jonas Burgos, fights for justice for her activist son, who is said to have desaparecido (“disappeared”).
Dr Burgos is the chair of Desaparecidos (Families of Desaparecidos for Justice), an organization seeking justice for the many unaccounted for, said to be a hallmark of the Arroyo regime.
Now, in Iran, humanitarian activist mothers are fast becoming global icons for human rights causes worldwide.
In silent public protest, the ‘Mourning Mothers of Iran,’ known in Tehran as the ‘Mothers of Laleh,’ peaceably seek justice for their dead or incarcerated children.
“A mother is a mother as long as she lives.”
As predicted, president Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali won the Tunisian elections for a fifth term.
What wasn't expected was that he would win with 89.62 per cent of the over all votes.
The prediction was that he would garner more votes.
Ben Ali's ruling party, the Democratic Constitutional Rally, also fared as well.
It won 161 of the 214 parliament seats.
The remaining 53 seats were won by six different parties: Movement for Democratic Socialists, 16 seats; Party of People's Unity, led by Mohamed Bouchiha, 12 seats; Ahmed Inoubli's Union of Democratic Unionists, 9 seats; Social Liberal Party, 8 seats; Party of Greens for Progress, 6 seats and Ahmed Brahim’s Ettajdid Party, 2 seats.
The ruling party announced the fairness and the impartiality of the 2009 elections.
But opposition leaders and bloggers have another opinion: they think that repressive acts and stifling controls on the election process have characterized the 2009 presidential and legislative elections in Tunisia on October 25, 2009.
لإنتصر الرئيس بسبعة و سبعين في المية
The Ugandan anti gay bill has been tabled in parliament and now it awaits the president Yoweri Museveni to sign and make homosexuality officially illegal.
The previous code was not clear but now the bill called "The anti homosexuality Bill 2009" tabled by a member of parliament David Bahati which states that any homosexuality act or tendencies might face the death penalty or face life imprisonment.
The Ugandan writes:
The multiple laws that I will be breaking as soon as the president signs this law.
Well, our detractors had already said that we would be stiffed with a tougher law, but this goes way beyond that.
If I attempt to commit the offense… (god, the number of times that I have made passes and they have been rejected!)
Each of those times was worth 7 years in jail.
Good heavens!!!!
Before, we could be liable to life imprisonment. gug hereby declares that, when the President of the Republic signs this law, gug will be liable to the death penalty… because I and my lover are serial offenders, breaking this law.
The bill further prohibits adoption by gay couples; any person who aids, promotes counsels any acts of homosexuality in any way will face up to seven years imprisonment, or risk a fine of sh100m.
It states the ill effects of homosexuality as:
Research indicates that the homosexuality has a variety of negative consequences including higher incidences of violence, sexually transmitted diseases, and use of drugs.
The higher incidence of separation and break-up in homosexual relationships also creates a highly unstable environment for children raised by homosexuals through adoption or otherwise, and can have profound psychological consequences on those children.
In addition, the promotion of homosexual behavior undermines our traditional family values.
Given Uganda’s historical, legal, cultural and religious values which maintain that the family, based on marriage between a man and a woman is the basic unit of society.
This Bill aims at strengthening the nation’s capacity to deal with emerging internal and external threats to the traditional heterosexual family.
These threats include: redefining human rights to elevate homosexual and transgender behavior as legally protected categories of people.
There is also need to protect our children and youths who are made vulnerable to sexual abuse and deviation as a result of cultural changes, uncensored information technologies, parentless child developmental settings and increasing attempts by homosexuals to raise children in homosexual relationships through adoption, foster care, or otherwise.
Producers, publishers and distributors of material containing homosexuality especially if a business, an NGO will have its certificate or registration canceled and the director will face seven years in prison.
That includes gay blogs in Uganda:
Poor sympathizers.
You are not left to love us.
No, all lovers of gays, and gays in Uganda will suffer, and be punished by this law.
Any press conferences?
Not by gay Ugandans.
You see, we are a pariah people that will never be like all other Ugandans.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, the gayuganda blog is one of the things which are illegal, as per that bill.
I am furiously promoting homosexuality on this blog, complaining about a law like this.
So, 5 years in prison, and my (non existent) bank balance will be set back by 100M Uganda shillings…!
And the people who dare to give us condoms and lubricant for sex… Or, if you dare to have an HIV prevention program for homosexuals in Uganda... or even try to teach safer sex.
Well, the penalties are stiff.
Very stiff.
Jail, and jail and other things.
Here are the objective of the bill.
3.1.
The objectives of the Bill The objectives of the Bill are:
(a) To protect marriage as that only between a man and a woman in Uganda;
(b) To prohibit homosexual behavior and related practices in Uganda as they constitute a threat to the traditional family;
(c) To safeguard the health of Ugandan citizens from the negative effects of homosexuality and related practices;
(d) To establish progressive legislation protective of the traditional family that can serve as a model for other countries;
(e) To prohibit ratification of any international treaties, conventions, protocols and declarations which are contrary or inconsistent with the provisions of this Act;
(f) To ensure that no international instruments to which Uganda is already a party can be interpreted or applied in Uganda in a way that was never intended at the time the document was created;
(e) To withdraw from any international agreements to which Uganda already is a party, or file reservations to them, which are re-interpreted to include protection for homosexual behavior, or that promote same-sex marriage, or that call for the promotion or teaching about homosexuality as being healthy, normal, or an acceptable lifestyle choice, or that seek to establish sexual behavior, sexual orientation, or gender identity, or sexual minorities as legally protected categories of people; and (f) To prohibit Uganda from becoming a party to any new international instruments that expressly include protection for homosexual behavior; promote same-sex marriage; call for the promotion or teaching about homosexuality or homosexual relations as being healthy, normal, or an acceptable lifestyle choice; and/or seek to establish sexual behavior, sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual minorities as legally protected categories of people
Gay Ugandan is urging you to take this cause with him and asks you if he deserves to die because of this:
If you are outside the country, why, that is very good.
Your congregation can be made aware of all the good things that some Christians in Uganda wish some sinners called gay Ugandans.
I am sure your outrage will help.
A letter, a protest match, questions to leaders of Uganda, religious and otherwise traveling outside the country.
This is a moral question, how can they justify killing me because I am gay, living in a gay relationship with another gay man?
# Ok, what of gay people in other countries.
You are our friends.
Yes, we dare to ask our gay brothers and sisters for help, especially when our countrymates believe we should be patriotic enough to ‘die’ in the name of their moral uprightness, for god and country.
Tell your local gay group about it.
Organise protests, big and small.
Educate any who doesnt know about it.
Write letters of protest.
Be courteous, (the framer of the bill says that we homosexuals want to kill him.
He says we have already written him ‘threatening’ letters.)
Afrogay another Ugandan blogger compares the Ugandan to the government to the Nazis, he says the time to flag down the bill is now:
Again, as I have argued here and elsewhere, we are best advised to keep our powder dry for the real battle if the bill is ever passed and signed into law.
So, I for one don't plan on saying too much about the nuts and bolts of what is wrong with it.
And the reason is simple: if we point out what is wrong with it now, our detractors will use what we say to clean up the bill.
Best then to shout foul as loud as we can on the discriminatory elements of the bill without guiding them around the glaring technical, legal, constitutional and human rights minefield they are sleep-walking towards with this bill.
A Nigerian blogger Anengiyefa thinks the bill is flawed and the panel who made the bill are ignorant about homosexuality, He says homosexuality cannot be an offense, you cannot punish someone for having sexual feelings for another person:
Mr Bahati goes on to demand the death penalty for what he calls "aggravated homosexuality".
I read this and I wondered if the said Mr Bahati has ever had the opportunity to sit inside a classroom in his life, given that unless he is starkly illiterate, he ought to know that there are no law books in any Common Law jurisdiction, (including Uganda), that refer to an offense known as 'homosexuality'.
Homosexuality cannot be an offense!
You cannot make it an offense and punish a person for having feelings of sexual and emotional attraction towards others of the same gender.
You cannot prove 'homosexuality' in a court of law to the standard of proof that is required in a criminal court.
Anengiyefa sees that Uganda has just seen hypocrisy of MPs who have unified and are ready to pass a law victimizing homosexuality in the name of morality: this beats the purpose why the system is so anxious to criminalize consensual sex amongst two adults of the same gender and omitting important issues like ethnic violence, tribalism, AIDS, child rape etc:
This outbreak of frenzied homophobia is the epitome of the hypocrisy that pervades political life in Africa.
At a time when expensive legislative time should be judiciously expended on the issues that really matter to the people of the country; when Ugandan lawmakers and the Ugandan government should be concerned about the welfare of vulnerable Ugandans, (including those same-gender loving men and women in their society, who are susceptible to wanton physical abuse and discrimination); when the Ugandan authorities should be looking to protect those of the country's citizens whose welfare is their responsibility; when the challenges that face our continent in this 21st Century are enormous; what we hear of instead is an Anti-Homosexuality Bill being introduced to Parliament.
This bill is deemed necessary according to the MP David Bahati who introduced it.
He claims that the purpose of the bill is to protect children and the "traditional family".
Marvin writes about Afripot, an African-focused news site: "She is now introducing Africa’s melting pot – Afripot.
I am already boiling in there and I hope to see you there too as conversations over there about Africa with Africans pick up and heat up.
Who knows, it may generate enough heat to force some of the changes we so badly need."

As the children's show Sesame Street celebrates its 40th anniversary this month, premiering its new season today, one cute and cuddly Muppet on its South African edition continues to help combat and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS.
While Sesame Street is seen in over 140 countries, each version addresses local issues and has different Muppets.
Golden-yellow Kami made her debut on the South African Sesame Street co-production, called Takalani Sesame, in 2002 in response to the country's HIV/AIDS problem.
The world's first HIV-positive Muppet, she helps educate kids about the disease and confronts issues related to being HIV-positive.
The name Kami is derived from the Setswana word “Kamogelo,” meaning “acceptance.”
Sunshinestar110, blogging on U Don't Like My Opinion...That's Fine! talks more about Kami:
"Kami is a healthy HIV Positive, affectionate 5 year old orphan who is a little shy but quickly joins when approached in a friendly way, She also knows a lot about HIV, she lost her mother to the disease.
When Kami was unveiled, with her mop of brown hair and she also wore a vest, wandering onto Sesame Street and wondering nervously if the residents will want to play with her.
She didn't have to worry because the other Muppets enthusiastically welcomed her."
Kami was introduced to help the many children in South Africa who are dealing with the HIV/AIDS crisis.
In addition to the physical complications of having HIV, there's also the stigma and taboo that comes with having the disease, which makes it harder for people to receive adequate treatment and support.
Takalani Sesame, which incorporates all 11 of South Africa's official languages, tries to help children address some of these issues head on through Kami.
However, there was much controversy when Kami was introduced, particularly in the U.S., as many were outraged that a children's show would feature an HIV-positive character.
Haven on Earth elaborates on the debate:
"Although it was reported that Kami's arrival on Sesame Street in South Africa was welcomed (I have a hard time accepting this as fact because of the still high level of denial still there), there was definite controversy here in United States.
I remember reading about this (which is why I was so pleased to actually encounter a show airing while in South Africa - it would have never occurred to me to look for it).
Apparently a group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to the President of PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) that airs Sesame Street.
The letter protested that plans to introduce a similar HIV-positive character in the United States in due course were inappropriate, given the age of the audience.
They suggested that such a move might threaten public funding of PBS ."
"Since most South African children know someone who has AIDS, the character has become a national hero, beloved by the country's people.
Kami has appeared at the United Nations and the World Bank and was interviewed by Katie Couric.
She has also been named a UNICEF ambassador for children and has appeared in Takalani segments alongside Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela."
Despite Kami's success, some bloggers still believe that she's not an appropriate character for the American version of Sesame Street.
Emily Meyer, blogging for her honors class, says:
"Although it is important for Americans to know about HIV/AIDS and the seriousness of the diseases, I think teaching kids at the ages of two and three is a little extreme.
Children this young would most likely not understand about HIV and would not understand its consequences.
If Kami was to be introduced in the United States as a way to spread knowledge and combat AIDS, I do not think the intended results would occur...Kids in America are not forced to deal with the issue of HIV/AIDS at that young of an age.
I think the appropriate time for kids in America to learn about the seriousness of HIV is when they are older, about ten or eleven years old or when the student becomes sexually active"
Still, many bloggers, such as this one writing on Muppets and History, see Kami has another example of how Sesame Street has pushed the boundaries.
Others profess their love for the Muppet and the message she brings to children.
And still others think she should be introduced on other versions of Sesame Street.
On her personal blog, Steisha Pintado says:
"She shows children that it is okay to hug someone who is HIV positive, and she explains what to do when she has a cut on her finger or if you have a cut yours.
She teachers her young audience about coping with illness and loss...Even though sex is never mentioned when talking about Kami’s condition, some people have said that having an HIV positive character would be inappropriate for a young viewing audience.
One legislature even claimed that the Sesame Workshop would lose its government funding if it aired a program with such a character in our country.
It is so shocking to hear these words.
Parents spend less and less time with their children, and allow the television to educate them more and more.
So obviously many parents aren’t teaching their children how to handle delicate subjects of awareness and acceptance.
Parents have already allowed the Sesame Workshop to introduce acceptance with those who have disabilities and illnesses, and also with those who are a different race or religion.
How is this any different?"
South African national anthem for English speakers: What a great way to visually explain the South African national anthem for those of us who firstly don’t know it by now, secondly know it but might not know how we are pronouncing it and thirdly don’t speak the languages in the anthem.
Celebrating your can may seem silly, but not having one can not only lead to embarrassment, lack of dignity and safety issues, but also preventable diseases and even death.
When people don't have toilets, they're forced to relieve themselves in open streets, fields, or back alleys.
The result?
The contamination of drinking water and food sources, which leads to a slew of health risks.
Lack of sanitation is the world’s biggest cause of infection and kills 1.8 million people, mostly children, a year.
Even countries with abundant toilets have to deal with problems ranging from unhygienic public toilets to waterway-destroying sewage disposal.
Vanilla, blogging on Let's Look At It This Way from Singapore, says that people should care about toilets:
"I know this is a crappy topic to most people.
It is unfortunate that it is a 'taboo' topic to talk about openly and many people remain ignorant about the scale of the problem.
I fail to understand how this can be an unimportant topic when, on an average, we visit the toilet 2500 times a year, or 6-8 times a day.
In our life time, we would have spent 3 years in the toilet."
Organized by the nonprofit The World Toilet Organization, World Toilet Day is being celebrated globally with various events.
To further increase awareness, WaterAid announced the launch of its new ToiletFinder UK App for iPhone users this week.
The free app helps Brits find the nearest public toilet while reminding them how lucky they are to have clean and safe toilets.
The largest event today, called The Big Squat, asks people to stop and squat for one minute in a public place to raise awareness.
These photos show people squatting globally, including this one of preschoolers in Singapore:
A blog from Brunei, the world according to panyaluru ..., also shows appreciation for the toilet by putting it into perspective:
"Imagine if we are walking along in the row of shops in Kiulap or Gadong.
Suddenly the tummy grumbles, just like the worst ribut you can think off.
No rest bite.
Grumble and grumble.
Rumblings.
The light is on amber and ready to turn green.
But no toilets in sight.
Not a single public toilet in the rows of shops...Add to that no water, no tissue, nothing!
That could be the worst day of your life, your worst nightmare, ever worse than the nightmares those kids have in the Nightmare on Elm Street Movies.
On this day, let’s show our appreciation to our toilets."
Some bloggers point out that toilets alone may not be the answer.
Sandhya, blogging on Maradhi Manni in India, says many men don't use available toilets:
"In a city like Chennai, where the climate is hot nearly 10 months of the year, I see men urinating on the roadside all the time.
When women can control and go home and relieve themselves, why can't men do so, I don't know.
So, first of all people should be fined heavily for doing this crime (yes, it is crime) on the spot.
I have seen them doing this on the wall of the public toilets!
In Srirangam, I saw them urinating on the compound wall of the temple even though every street surrounding the temple had toilets, which were clean, but pay toilets!"
While lack of sanitation impacts everyone, the taboo around toilets can disproportionately affect women.
In some countries, modesty forces women do their business in fields before sunrise or to hold it until after the sun sets, leading to health and safety concerns.
Joanne Sprague, blogging on Overturning Boulders in India, observes that women are absent from the morning toilet run in Chennai, while in Ethiopia the blog AN ADVENTURE IN ADDIS notices a similar situation:
"I’ve heard so often about the lack of toilet facilities for women or lack of toilets in general; that teenage girls in the countryside get up at 4 am to go out in the dark to do their business so they don’t get bullied by the boys at school or stop going to school altogether.
Men just pee anywhere, cigarette in hand and there’s an assumption that women don’t need to, if they are thought about at all....I want to see a huge billboard in Amharic saying ‘Girls go too’ with a picture of Barbie sitting on a toilet."
To celebrate World Toilet Day, blogger Jonathan Stray, takes readers on an international tour of toilets he's visited, from Thailand and the U.K. to West Africa and Oman, concluding:
"We in the west with our flush toilets and toilet paper and sparkling shower stalls are the exception; the rest of the world thinks a bathroom is a wet, smelly place, when they have a bathroom at all.
A good toilet means you probably have a very good quality of life, so enjoy yours.
Happy World Toilet Day!"

Tension is building between Egyptian and Algerian football fans ahead of a decisive match due to take place in Cairo on November 14.
The encounter will determine which of both teams will qualify to next year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa.
Egypt needs at least a two-goal win to force a playoff on a neutral ground while Algeria, which has failed to qualify to the World Cup since 1986, will battle to keep its current leading position in the qualifiers group.
Ahead of the Saturday showdown, rival fans have been gearing up offline, as well as in heated online exchanges, escalating into a bitter "cyber-war" of intimidation.
Algerian blogger Adel , sums up the chain of events that led to the row.
He writes:
s much as i am angry for what happend to the algerian team, i do not judge a whole nation for what some idiots did! it is stupid what angry fans are doing! for god's sake it wont matter who gets in the .
Egyptian blogger Lasto Adri , deplores how what was supposed to be a sporting event, degenerated into a nasty confrontation.
She writes:
Desertification might sound similar to desert, but there is a fundamental difference between the two: while deserts are one of nature’s wonderful formations, desertification is a process of degradation that lands go through after they are affected by climate change, human activities, and natural forces until they eventually become deserts.

Although the influence of climate change on desertification has not been fully understood yet, according to GreenFacts, it is known that higher temperatures resulting from increased carbon dioxide levels can have a negative impact through increased loss of water from soil and reduced rainfall in drylands.
At the same time desertification contributes to climate change by releasing to the atmosphere carbon stored in dryland vegetation and soils.
Desertification is taking its toll worldwide.
At this moment it’s destroying harvests, driving up the price of remaining food, and in some areas, animals are dying.
People are also being driven away from their homes, as blogger Miguel Angel Alvarado from El Salvador explains about the president’s home needing to be moved because of desertification :
The capital of Angola, Luanda, is a very expensive city.
Both for Angolans as well as for foreigners.
If you are here, you are well aware.
Basic services, like food, education and housing are priced on par with some European countries.
The main difference is that the salaries in Angola are simply laughable when compared to their European counterparts, which leads to daily battles to secure basic needs.
Obviously this battle is not fought by those with money who, for reasons obscure or not, are protected with bank accounts that would make mere mortals envious.
According to a survey conducted in February by an English company, ECA International - Luanda ranks first among the most expensive cities in the world.
In his blog Mundo da Verdade , Miguel Caxias writes:
Days after the sentencing of two video blogging youth activists in Azerbaijan, other bloggers are starting to speak out about the imprisonment of Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli.
The two online activists will spend 2 and 2.5 years in jail after a trial which most consider to be politically motivated and an attempt to silence dissent in the country.
They join others such as the Presidency of the European Union, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Reporters Without Borders as well as many others in condemning the verdict.
Amnesty International has also declared the two men to be prisoners of conscience.
Interesting Times, an "online initiative monitoring attempts throughout the world to censor and restrict free access to the Internet," puts the trial in context.
The latest show of repression by state forces in Azerbaijan leaves no doubt that both journalists and bloggers exercise their right to express themselves freely at their own risk.
Thanks to international pressure such as the WPFC letter and several others, the Azeri government has been compelled to release journalists from prison.
But this latest act of repression against two bloggers leaves no doubt that, if left alone, public officials in Azerbaijan will continue their abusive ways.
Notes from Abroad is also not surprised by the verdict.
Since Azerbaijan is an oil-rich fiefdom, the West has treaded carefully in responding to this very undemocratic behavior by the Azeri government.
The Azeri government must be strongly condemned by the democracies of the world that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.
The Blogar, however, is nearly speechless.
So the verdict is in.
Emin and Adnan are officially hooligans.
At a loss here on what to say.
Supposedly social media had a role in putting them behind bars, a role in getting the word out on the street about the injustice but was unable to change the minds of the corrupt Azerbaijan legal system.
Dont mess with Ilham. My thoughts are with their families and them.
However, with an appeal due to be lodged and possible action in the European Court of Human Rights, L4L, a new English-language Azeri blog, says that this is just the beginning.
What to do next?
First of all we should not stop.
We should continue working towards liberty of our friends and towards freedom of all Azerbaijan. Adnan and Emin showed no fear and we should not be anything less than courageous and inspiring.
This is hardly end.
It all begins now.

The Chacaltaya mountain range contains some of the most symbolic peaks in Bolivia's Andes Mountains.
As it once was one of the only places to snow ski in this mountainous country, these mountains are well-known to those in the Department of La Paz, as well as foreign adventurers.
The mountains have also hosted charity football matches in which Bolivian President Evo Morales participated, seeking to prove that the sport can be played at high altitudes.
However, Chacaltaya's glacier has been receding at a worrisome and rapid pace.
The effects of climate change on this glacier and others in the region have been part of the investigation by Higher University of San Andrés professor Edson Ramírez, who concludes a direct connection between global warming and the disappearance of the glacier.
Ramírez and his team have also been studying another nearby glacier that is undergoing similar changes and about the effect on the local population. The Tuni Condoriri glacier is melting at a rapid pace, affecting alpine enthusiasts, but also affecting a vulnerable migrant population that depends on it for drinking water and agricultural activities.
The reservoir that collects the water from the glacier provides 80% of the drinking water to the city of El Alto and the outskirts of La Paz.
According to the most recent census, El Alto has a population of 827,000 people , which is increasing every year at a rate of 5.1% per year.
According to journalist and blogger Mónica Oblitas, this rate is more than double the national average .
Experts are predicting water shortages and a premium for water, with some people predicting that water rationing is imminent .
The team from Observador Global (Global Observer) created a 6-part video series about the effects of future water shortages in this region.
The city is home to migrants from the Aymara indigenous communities on the Bolivian Altiplano, who settle in El Alto, often in impoverished conditions.
Bolivian blogger Cristina Quisbert of the blog Indigenous Bolivia describes the situation that many residents face in terms of suitable drinking water:
Additional conditions difficult access to water.
A lot of people arrive from rural area to El Alto and establish wherever they can.
Because of lack of money, they live in neighborhoods where there is neither drinkable water nor sewer system.
Some of them dig a hole which should be about three metres deep until they find water.
More or less in November, it starts rainy time and it is other possibility for neighbors to collect water.
At the end, lack of water added to existent levels of poverty many times result in illnesses.
There is an heterogeneity of situations.
I have water at home but some of my neighbors don't.
This is a serious problem for the families.
In my case, I share water with other family.
Basilio and Juana have four children.
They are renters.
The house where they live doesn't have drinkable water.
Whenever they need, they use a hose to collect water from my house and at end of the month we divide the cost of water invoice to pay.
However, the Tuni Condoriri, not only provides drinking water to the city, but it also provides valuable water for agricultural activities on the Altiplano.
If sustainable agricultural activities decrease because of the lack of water, many more rural residents may seek opportunities in El Alto, where they may face similar water shortages, while raising demand.
350.org activists climb to the Chacaltaya glacier in Bolivia in preparation for a major event on October 24.

It is the high-profile image of the Chacaltaya glacier that is drawing attention from local government official and other activist groups to the problem of climate change in the Bolivian Occident.
A recent local event associated with the 350.org campaign was advertised on Facebook , inviting Bolivians to take an excursion to the Chacaltaya glacier to see for themselves the effects.
Finally, Oblitas concludes with the following questions :
On the eve of Brazil's Black Pride Day – celebrated on November 20th, when the country renews its ongoing fight against discrimination – the Circo Voador Audiovisual Collective did an experiment.
They filmed two members of their group, of apparently the same age and dressed similarly, trying to enter the same bank at two different moments, carrying the very same bag filled with metal - keys, coins, mobile phone.
One of them took a few seconds to get in with no issues at all; the other one could not get in, barred at the revolving door, a regular feature in many Brazilian banks.
The first guy was white, the second, black.
See the result:
According to the filmmakers, the experiment showed that the metal detector doors are in fact activated by the banks' security guards.
In other words, the security method currently employed by banks is based on their personnel's pre-judgment, often plagued with preconceptions, stereotypes and discrimination against certain types of people.
On their blog, Circo Voador invites readers to join forces, sending their own videos of as many different banks as possible.
They explain the experiment:
Last week, images of a war between drug traffickers and dealers in Rio de Janeiro spread across the world.
Clashes between gangs from the hills Morro São João and Morro dos Macacos on October 17th frightened the population.
Hundreds of state police deployed in an effort to subdue rival gangs did not help: the conflict between drug dealers and police resulted in a downed police helicopter killing three police officers, and claimed the lives of over 30 other people, among them suspected gang members and bystanders.

The Censurado blog criticizes the governors' attitude toward this crisis, after hearing news suggesting that the police didn't know anything about the invasion:
The nearly 20 million inhabitants of Cameroon are facing rising levels of criminality.
Bandits even stormed the national headquarters of the police and the Ministry of External Relations (Foreign Affairs) in the capital city, Yaounde.
PNT Attitude shared her experience with crime in a recent post describing how her hand bag was stolen from her car:
...I pulled over to buy some mangoes.
Mangoes bought, I open the door of the vehicle to put the mangoes on the back seat.
Just then I saw this guy loitering on the other side of the car.
I paid him no attention.
Suddenly he opened the passenger door, grabbed my red handbag lying on the front seat, and dashed into the market.
I initially thought he wanted to do a carjacking, or was he just trying to make me uncomfortable by getting into the car?
Could he be mentally deranged?
I screamed “voleur” and ran after him with the mangoes, which I threw at him before he made the corner, thereby getting out of sight.
Yes, you might be thinking I was careless leaving the bag there, fyi, it was hidden beneath that same seat until when I thought I had finished shopping!"
But the beautiful twist in her story is that some of the thieves in Yaounde could be really "kind".
Even the police know that if one is lucky they can have their personal belongings back by visiting the place where they were robbed (mugged).
So she drove there:
I was told that a guy with a red bag came a few minutes after I left asking “where is the lady whose bag was snatched”.
Since they didn’t find me, they took it away.
My friend and I searched around the escape route for a little bit and another person advised that we check with the nearby radio station.
We went there and the receptionist said: “...yes we received a bag this morning and the contents belonged to...Ntemgwa...!” that was it, I was SOOO RELIEVED that I found the bag, she brought it out, I checked the contents and I said everything was in tact, unless of course the money and fuel voucher.
She added “10.000frs, withdrawal fee”.
I tried to argue and realised whatever was still in that bag had more value than the amount requested.
I however negotiated for 5.000frs and I got the bag, went back home, happily."
After such an experience here are some of the lessons learned by PNT:
- Not all thieves have evil intentions, some are opportunists who are just hungry;
- There exist organised (petty) crime in the Mokolo market, beware in all you do whenever you find yourself there, organised because all they want is your money, and everyone around knows where you can find your bag after the incident, who knows if there is more to the whole setup than meets the eyes?
- It is normal to be attacked in such crowded markets, the policemen played down the whole drama, wondering y I was feeling bad (at all), yes there is no service to take care of trauma victims in the police station since it is “normal” to be victimised like that...
- I miss those mangoes and I have nothing against them;"
Speaking of buying fruits in Yaounde, a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer blogging at Adventures of Aubrey seems to have been haggling a bit over the price of apples.
The conversations with those selling the apples certainly reveal a lot about the perceptions associated with race which engender misconceptions:
During my trip to Yaounde this week I went to buy apples, twice.
The first time I was walking down the street and saw a man with an apple cart.
I asked him the price and then told him that was the white person's price and apples should cost this and that I wanted to buy these two apples for this much.
He laughed and went down in price but not enough.
We talked back and forth a few minutes and finally he wanted 50 more CFA (like 10 cents) and I wouldn't pay it and so I grabbed a plastic bag and bagged my own apples and left the money on his cart while we both laughed and I walked away saying thank you and that I would come back next time (this is a common way to leave a conversation in Cameroon - saying thanks, next time)."
...I saw another man with an apple cart outside of a white person store in downtown Yaounde (that was mistake one, trying outside a white person store).
I asked him how much the apples were, went into the store with my friend and her mom, and we came back and I decided I wanted apples and began to bargin.
He got angry and started screaming at me that why would I assume the price could change - he told me the price and I should have accepted it and blah blah blah.
So I laughed it off telling him, this is Cameroon you discute for all the prices and tried again to bargin with him.
He got angry again.
Then, I got mad.
I told him he was very rude and that I didn't care what his apples cost now I wasn't buying any from him.
He yelled back that I was rude to try to bargin with him when I was rich (aka white).
I repeated that he was rude and wouldn't get my money today or in the future and left.
A year ago that interaction might have upset me but now I simply ran to catch up with my friend and her mom and repeated it while laughing and saying that I guessed it wasn't my day for apples."
Instead of nearly running into trouble haggling, maybe Aubrey (or anyone else planning a stay in Cameroon) should use pay-as-you-go mobile airtime credits as legal tender.
It seems a much easier way of buying things without cash if one goes by PNTs Attitude:
I almost finished buying the items on my list when I decided to go into a lingerie shop to look for an item that has been on my shopping list forever: a seamless wireless bra.
I was very lucky to find it in this shop, and as fate would have it, it was the last one available and I hadn’t seen it in any other shop.
The salesperson said it cost CFA 4,500.
Behold I had just CFA 3,500 on me!
I tried to haggle the price to the amount I had on me, in vain.
I thought of taking a much dreaded along walk to the car and also the possibility of paying partially by a telephone credit transfer.
The latter option seemed more likely.
So I asked her if she had an MTN phone so I could complete the payment through a phone credit transfer.
She said no, she had an Orange phone.
However she added, “I have a friend on the MTN network you can send the remaining CFA1000 to”.
Problem solved, I went away with the much-sought-for bra, smiling as I walked away."

In the most religious country of the South Caucasus where the Orthodox Church's Patriarch can even encourage a baby boom, criticizing the clergy is still somewhat taboo.

A statement from the Interior Ministry identified the culprits as a school pupil and a student.
Evolutsia, examines the larger issue as it relates to the power of the Church and freedom of speech.
In an op-ed piece on the newly launched English-language news blog, Inge Snip sounds the alarm bells.
One of the most fundamental freedoms is, I believe, the freedom of speech.
Freedom of speech enables a country to show to every citizen that their opinion is allowed to be heard, no matter the content.
In addition, a true democracy allows the mocking of important figures in society, and by doing so, it shows its maturity.
To conclude, there is no grounds for investigating this issue, nor should there be; however, the law enforcement agencies did the opposite, because there is some kind of popular demand.
As a student of law, this is easily one of the most ridiculous grounds for any judicial investigation I have ever heard.

Iran's Green Movement opposition organized mass street protests on the 4th of November (13th of Aban), taking advantage of the official rallies being held on the same day to mark the 30th anniversary of the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran.
The opposition protests were met with a violent crackdown by security forces.

Never before have so many people been threatened or imprisoned for what the words they write on the internet.
As activists and ordinary citizens have increasingly made use of the internet to express their opinions and connect with others, many governments have also increased surveillance, filtering, legal actions and harassment.
The harshest consequence for many has been the politically motivated arrest of bloggers and online writers for their online and/or offline activities, in some tragic cases even leading to death.
Online journalists and bloggers now represent 45% of all media workers in prison worldwide.
Today, Global Voices Advocacy is launching a new website called Threatened Voices to help track suppression of free speech online.
It features a world map and an interactive timeline that help visualize the story of threats and arrests against bloggers worldwide, and it is a central platform to gather information from the most dedicated organisations and activists, including Committee to Protect Bloggers, The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Reporters without Borders, Human Rights Watch, CyberLaw Blog, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voices Advocacy.
What blogger, where?
Finding accurate information about arrested and threatened bloggers and online writers is difficult for several reasons.
First, the secrecy surrounding online censorship and repression makes it extra difficult to be accurate.
Not a single week passes without stories of arrests of yet another online journalist or activist in countries like Egypt or Iran, but the details and reasons are often shrouded in mystery.
Second, there is still some confusion about the definition of a "blogger".
Professional journalists are increasingly migrating to online media and blogs in pursuit of more freedom, blurring the old lines of definition.
And many so-called cyber-dissidents in China, Tunisia, Vietnam, or Iran, do not have personal blogs.
Other times, bloggers are arrested for their offline activity, rather than for what they have published online.
This confusion has sometimes made it hard for online free speech advocates to come up with a good strategies and partnerships to defend bloggers and online activists, but it has never been more important to try.
Let's work together
At Global Voices we engage a community of authors, editors, and translators, who help keep us all informed of free speech and human rights abuses.
With Threatened Voices we aim to open the process of reporting up even further to any person who has information.
We're calling on those whose friends, relatives, colleagues, or compatriots, have been threatened to help create and update the profiles of those missing or under arrest, so we can seek additional sources, verify, and link to online campaigns dedicated to freeing them.
In the process, we are hoping to learn more about when, where, and to what extent bloggers are being subjected to abuse in different countries, so we can share that information widely with journalists, researchers, and activists, and work towards creating an internet where everyone can exercise their right to speak freely, and where bloggers in prison are not forgotten.
Help spread the word.

Malawian President wants more power!: "Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika, whose party enjoys a parliamentray majority, is seeking to beef up his powers before he exits the political stage in 2014."
A shooting rampage carried out by US Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan that killed 13 and injured 31 in Fort hood, Texas has once again put Muslims in America under the spotlight - especially those serving in the army.
Moments after Major Hasan was announced as the suspected shooter, there was clear discomfort among newscasters and commentators regarding his religious and ethnic background.
It's also been widely reported that Muslim service members have sometimes faced attacks from fellow services members.
Howard M. Friedman, Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Toledo, says in his blog ReligionClause:
"The military has been actively recruiting Muslims with the linguistic skills and cultural understanding needed to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However Muslims in the service face suspicion by some of their officers. "
Whatever suspicions of Muslim service members existed before the shootings, one can only fear that they may have been heightened by the mass murder in Fort Hood.
Questions are still being raised as to whether Major Hasan was an extremist who carried out the attack based on religious ideology or he was simply mentally ill.
In Canada, writer Gwynne Dyer, at Vancouver weekly free paper Straight.com, argues that pointing out the murderer's religion overlooks some very serious issues:
"After a few days while the commentariat hesitated before competing narratives, the media are settling on the explanation that it was ethnic/racial/religious abuse that drove Nidal crazy.
Bad people doing un-American things were ultimately responsible for the tragedy, and there’s an end to it.
The one explanation that is excluded is that America’s wars in Muslim lands overseas are radicalizing Muslims at home.
Never mind that the homegrown Muslim terrorists who attacked the London transport system in 2005, and the various Muslim plotters who have been caught in other Western countries before their plans came to fruition, have almost all blamed the Western invasions of Muslim countries for radicalizing them.
Never mind, above all, that what really radicalized them was the fact that those invasions made no sense in terms of Western security."
Fox News, often criticized for its bias on issues related to immigration and conservative politics, is reportedly calling for the "screening of Muslims" in the army.
At the Veterans Today website, a retired officer of the United States Coast Guard, Tom Barnes, says the news channel is playing up the stereotype to create "us versus them" tensions:
"... the news channel is being very "unhelpful" to say the least if this initially reasonable question soon turns into another Fox Channel crusade against "them".
This stuff is not only getting old, it is dangerous.
The story is here.
As I have previously pointed out, this kind of thing has happened before in the U.S. Armed Forces.
I am getting tired of Fox News telling me who my enemies are.
All the time.
Non stop.
I had no idea there were so many "thems" out there!"
A number of newspapers are now examining how Major Hasan's actions will affect Muslims serving the in US army, and Muslim residents around Fort Hood.
As the investigation of the massacre continues, the spotlight on Muslims serving in the army will likely continue.
Finally, justice has been served in the case of Marwa El-Sherbini, the Egyptian woman who was stabbed to death inside a German courthouse by a Russian-German immigrant.
After nearly four and a half months, Alex Wiens has been sentenced to life imprisonment, without a possibility for early release.
Bikya Misr, wrote about the case:
After nearly four and a half months, the Marwa el-Sherbini saga has come to a conclusion of sorts after a German court sentenced the man who stabbed the “veiled martyr” 17 times inside the court in July to life in prison without possibility of early release.
Egyptians, Arabs and Germans alike have welcomed the verdict and hope Europe and the Middle East can begin to heal the wounds of the killing and move “toward a better future.”
Hicham Maged wrote about how glad he is for the ruling, and that he has real trust in the German justice system:
The judge was aware about various tricks from the killer's defence team and here I quote the words according to this article: “ He killed ... not out of fear but out of revenge.
He consciously exploited her innocence and defencelessness. ”
I agree with this and do not forget that he also tried to kill her husband.
I am glad that the courtroom where betrayal took place has been washed up physically and morally by applying justice.
Consequently, my trust in the German justice system was needless to mention because this crime was shocking for all of us not only Germans.
For that matter, only today Marwa and her unborn baby can rest in peace after compensating from the killer.
Zeinobia was happy with the verdict, and she also wrote in response to those who believed that it is a political verdict, and that the German court ruled in favour of Marwa in order to please the Egyptians, and Arabs:
Now I want to say something, some racists “and they are not few in the world now”, will say that this is a political verdict ; the court had to take to win the hearts and minds of Muslims around the world and to save the German interests is the Islamic world.
Well with my all respect I said it before and will say it again; do not think of Marwa as a Muslim woman; think of her as a Pregnant woman and a mother who was brutally stabbed 18 times in front of her little boy.
He killed two souls, innocent souls because of blind hate and racism.
He deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life for taking the life of innocent souls and take the life of a mother from her child
Aam Mina on the other hand wrote a post, making fun of those who believe in conspiracy theories and were expecting the Germans to rule in favour of the murderer: I don't know why, since the announcement of the verdict, I haven't heard any of those who kept on talking about the Germans and how racist they are, and that they hate Arabs and Muslims. They also claimed that the court will rule in favour of the murderer and he will be imprisoned for a year or two only, and that our only hope is to declare sacred war against the secular, rotten, Zionist, and infidel West.
What happened to Marwa should be a ‘wake-up’ call that make people work for achieving this both by criticising extreme actions taken against people because of their faith or race and understanding our differences and this simply means to quite stereotyping from whoever against whoever.
When Radio Netherlands broadcasted an Arabic translation of the Artificial Virginity Hymen kit, when Youm7 newspaper announced that the product will be available on the Egyptian market for LE 83, when conservative parliament members in Egypted wanted the product banned and any exporter exiled or beheaded, and when it caused such an uproar in the Egyptian blogosphere, Mohamed Al Rahhal just had to buy one.
As he went to retrieve his package at the post office:
it had been opened by various puzzled customs and postal employees who, at a loss, defined the product in writing as "containing an unknown red liquid" – and awaited my description.
He told them it was "cinematographic make-up" and took the item home:
Placed in the vagina before sex, the plastic hardens slightly, and rips upon intercourse.
A few drops of "blood" will stain the sheets, preserving the woman's, her family's, or society's "honour".
Whether it does actually work or not I cannot answer.
The complete absence of medical information on the product, as well as online accusations that this product can cause infections, made me unwilling to give it to a volunteer to test.
Mona El Tahawy did not like how Egyptians were hot and bothered over fake hymensWith all the troubles Egypt faces these days — spiralling cost of living, a president in power for 28 years whose son looks likely to succeed him, etc. — why all the fuss over hymens, real or fake?
Welcome to the hypocrisy and denial that together drum at the heart of conservative religious views on women and chastity.
And in the case of Egypt, that conservatism applies equally to Muslims and Christians.
As a Muslim, I know the Qur’an preaches chastity for men and women, but the conservative obsession with women means only females are expected to abide by the prohibition on extramarital sex.
This obsession with virginity is shallow at best and deadly at worst.
Mohamed El Rahhal strongly condemns:
the hypocrisy that allows us to discriminate against 50% of the society while giving a free pass to the other half.
I am against forcing women to go such lengths, sometimes endangering their health, to allow us to delay a long-awaited national moratorium on gender relations.
Morality is worst interpreted by anatomy.
And if we're waiting upon a small piece of plastic to define morality, then we've already failed – and ought to find a better definition.
In much of the world, nothing is more unifying - or in some instances, more polarizing - than a football match.
Fans of Egypt and Algeria, across the Arab world and beyond, proved that this Saturday as their teams went head to head to qualify for the World Cup finals in South Africa.
While tensions ran highest in Cairo, they were also alive and well in the virtual sphere, including on Twitter, where many users reported their screen was filled with football sentiment.
Twitter user mbaa sent a capture of his screen, which was flooded with talk of the match:
A tweet from Egyptian embee demonstrated the fanaticism of some fans:
Some reports claim that tickets are now entirely sold out!
At the same time, Egyptian NoraYounis expressed disbelief at the unifying power of football for Egyptians:
Egyptian NohaAtef's tweet, on the other hand, showed the uplifting properties of football:
In many instances, the football matched unearthed national rivalries.
Algerians and Egyptians went head to head on Twitter as the game was taking place.
Egyptian Sandmonkey quipped:
Algerian-American themoornextdoor fought back, joking:
Finally, Algerian reemba reminded us that it ain't over till it's over:
Gamal Mubarak preceded Britney Spears (30th) and Barack Obama (37th).
Zeinobia shared the top 10 most influential people in Egypt according to Shokeir's survey: First of all we do not have these kinds of lists in Egypt regularly , second you must know that this was held on an Egyptian blog , the participants are considered a very small sample from the Egyptian society “More than 120 participants on his blog and more than 300 participants in the event on the face book” and some may considered it as unrepresentative sample still most of the answers surprisingly represent the views of most Egyptian people as I see it.
Saving the best for last, Zeinobia shared the top 9:
In 10th place for 168 points The Egyptian National football team trainer Hassan Shahata.
In 9th place for 181 points businessman Naguib Sawiris.
In 7th place for 200 points journalist Ibrahim Eissa .
In 6th place for 202 points businessman Ahmed Ezz.
In 5th place for 215 points scientist Ahmed Zowail.
In 4th place for 262 points TV hostess Mona El-Shazely.
In 3rd place for 325 points footballer Mohamed Abu-Tarika.
In 2nd place for 364 points Gamal Mubarak.
As for Egypt's most influential figure,
Now to my surprise :
In 1st place for 496 points comes Islamic TV preacher Amr Khalid.
With no doubt that the previous nine except for Ahmed Zoweil has played an important and influential role in our lives in 2009 but Amr Khalid !!??
Zeinobia is aware that:
this survey came at the seasonal peak of Khalid’s popularity after his Ramadan TV shows this year contributed much to this result besides of course the role of religion in our lives.
But she still wonders if he deserves to come first in the list.
Chidi Opara remembers Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Nigerian writer, environmental and minority rights activist who was executed on 10th November, 1995 by the then military rulers of Nigeria
It's well known that Nigeria has an image problem – 419 Internet scams, corruption, oil piracy in the Delta region – for many people, these are the associations that come to mind when Africa's most populous country is mentioned.
However, the last year has been especially hard on Nigeria's reputation abroad: over the past few months, a series of events depicting Nigeria in a questionable light have triggered discussions throughout the blogosphere.
In September, Sony released an ad for Playstation 3 which included the line, “You can't believe everything you read on the Internet – otherwise, I'd be a Nigerian millionaire by now.”
The ad was met with consternation from many Nigerians, and the Federal Government requested that Sony make a formal apology (Sony did apologize and later withdrew the ad).
Around the same time came the release of District 9 – a sci-fi blockbuster which was critically well-received but irksome to many Nigerians.
The Nigerian government took offense at the film's depiction of Nigerians as criminals and cannibals, banning the film within Nigeria and asking the Censor's Board to confiscate it from theaters.
Online, the movie provoked varied reactions, with some taking the view that the film presents a racist view of Nigerians, while others defended it as a fictional representation with little bearing on reality.
Adamu Waziri at EVCL points out that often Nigerian depictions of Nigerians are equally unflattering:
Nollywood, our indigenous movie industry, has portrayed us in a much harsher light to both national and international audiences.
There was a time where you couldn’t get Nollywood movie that didn’t include one of the following or a combination of them; fraud, juju/witchcraft, armed robbery, incest, adultery, cannibalism and of course our favourite, corruption.
Nollywood has been pumping out thousands of movies with these themes for years with no real opposition from the general public or any Ministry.
... Banning films sets the wrong precedent; in fact it can be dangerous.
Let us the public debate the issue.
We are mature enough to do so.
In fact our Minister has succeeded in giving the movie more publicity which I’m sure she didn’t intend to do.
Nicole Stamp comments on race in District 9:
The thing that really upsets me is that most people who see this movie won’t question, or even notice, this incredibly racist portrayal....
Why can’t the Nigerians just be people with logical motives like money and weapons?
Why do they have to go out of their way to be ooga-booga savages? ….it is impossible to disregard the charged portrayal of Nigerians which when viewed in a larger context, is beyond damaging or defamatory but is dangerous.
Read more on the debate at Nigerianstalk.org or google "district 9 race".
More recently, Time magazine published a slide show by the South African photographer Pieter Hugo which featured scenes from Nigeria's “Nollywood” movie industry.
Though not so controversial as District 9 or the Playstation commercial, the photographs nonetheless prompted debate in the blogosphere, with discussions over whether such depictions of Nigeria fall under the category of artistic freedom or cultural bias.
Solomon Sydelle at Nigerian Curiosity writes:
I definitely understand the need to push the envelope, after all that desire has led to some of the most creative masterpieces and accomplishments of all time.
However, with these pictures, I struggle to develop an appreciation of them and/or what they represent and believe that they unnecessarily relied on biases that will only confirm certain stereotypes for Hugo's mainly Western audience.
These events are especially ill-timed as they correspond to a new initiative launched earlier this year to “Re-brand Nigeria.”
The initiative is sponsored by Dr. Dora Akunyili, Nigerian Minister of Information and Communication, and has been met with both praise and criticism (see here for the discussion at Global Voices).
Bunmi Oloruntoba at A Bombastic Element discusses the re-branding campaign in the context of a recent BBC discussion on the subject:
The minister has a good case when she argues that Nigeria is overlooking a lot of positives, has not been telling her stories and is making the mistake of letting the world define her image based on its notoriety alone.
And she has some good examples of the positives.
But the BBC sought out a few PR and branding experts who counter by saying, if the country wants to rebrand itself, it needs to give any PR team a lot more to build on.
Those interviewed said, consistent power supply and an end to a diesel generator economy will make rebranding Nigeria "effortless."
And to prove their point, 13:40 mins into the program... well, you don't need to be a Nigerian to figure out what happened.
A bright spot in the discussion of Nigeria's image was a widely circulated video of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaking on “The danger of a single story.”
Adichie comments on the pitfalls of a monolithic image of Africa as a site of catastrophe; she cautions that limiting ourselves to a “single story” flattens experience and creates stereotypes.
For many bloggers, Adichie's remarks resonated with their frustration at the depictions of Nigeria prevalent outside the country.
Shade NonConformist writes of the connection between Adichie's speech and Nigeria's image:
I believe this is what Chimamada Adichie meant about The Danger of a Single Story lecture she gave at TED.
It becomes a problem when the only portrayal of Africa that we see is one involving dead animals, poverty, disaster, death, corruption, celebrity adoptions...you know the whole nine yards.
Now I'm not saying Africa does not have these issues.
We can all agree that we do.
I'm arguing that these issues are not specific to African countries.
... I/We will never stop criticizing depictions of Africa that are unbalanced and prejudiced.
Presenting a balance depiction of Africa is crucial.
As Africans we also need to act as vessels who are willing to be instrumental in the change we want to see (and will see) in our beloved continent.
A Biogas plant.
Image by Flickr user Marufish.
Used under a creative commons licenseBiogas technology is starting a green revolution in Nepal.
According to WWF firewood is the preferred energy source in the country as almost 87% of households depend on it.
However, biogas is emerging as a viable alternative.
A recent report by AFP divulges that Nepal is making money (almost 600,000 US$ in 2007) trading carbon emissions with the help of numerous biogas plants across the country.
For a nation struggling find cheap and sustainable source of energy, biogas certainly brings good news for Nepal.
Globalwarming Arclein, a blog on how agriculture can help reduce carbon emission, says that the low tech approach of biogas makes it accessible to the majority of Nepalese people who live in villages:
"Biogas production is not high technology.
It takes a cistern that can be made with a shovel and perhaps setting liner stones as is often done in a modern septic field.
Capping this and drawing of the produced gas into a holding tank is simple and usage after that needs again fairly minimalist hardware that can be jury-rigged together.
The major requirement is to simply know that it can be done and that it will work.
Recovery of the produced slurry later is unpleasant but no different than similar tasks attended to.It is not a convenient way to produce enough gas for household heating, but certainly sufficient to support incidental heating for cooking and producing hot water in a healthy way."
Nepal's success in biogas could inspire its neighbors too.
Nepal's closest ally India is also looking forward to develop alternative energy sources to deal with the growing demand in its rapidly industrialized states.
Razib Ahmed at South Asia Blog, which focuses on the region's business and social issues, says:
"I am interested about biogas a lot because I believe that it has immense potential not only for Nepal but also for neighboring countries like India and Bangladesh.
Biogas Sector Partnership Nepal (BSP-Nepal) is an NGO that is actively working for the promotion of biogas in the country.
Until June 2008, 172,858 biogas plants have been made with their support.
As a result, more than 1 million people are getting the benefits.
1 million people may not sound to be that much to you but you have to remember that it is mainly the poor people living in rural areas who got benefited through this technology.
Not only that, I would also like to catch your attention about the fact that Nepal imports almost 100% of its oil.
So, every biogas plant made means saving some foreign currency for the country."
And the interest in biogas is not a passing fad for Nepal.
After many years of hard work and careful planning, it has been able to generate significant attention.
Back in 2005, Mallika Aryal at RenewableEnergyAccess reported on Nepal's quest to generate sustainability and revenue through biogas.
"Nepal's Biogas Support Program has extended its work to 66 of the nation's 75 districts and plans to have 200,000 biogas plants installed by 2009.
A plant suitable for a rural household costs US $300.
Government subsidies have made the plants affordable.
An individual invests only $200 and his investment is recouped in three years.
A very good deal indeed!
Now the Nepali biogas plants are on their way to becoming a "good deal" for the global environment.
When Kyoto Protocol, the global climate treaty, will enter into force for Nepal in December 2005, it would be eligible to start trading the carbon dioxide not emitted by using biogas and earn up to $5 million per year."
To learn more about how biogas is helping Nepal, here is a video produced by the Nepal Project at Tokyo City University, Japan.
On November 6, a police officer at the Department of Internal Affairs in Novorossiysk used his personal Web site to address Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and talk about numerous problems police officers face in Russia.
I think many people will understand me.
I want to work but I am fed up with fictional plans when we are forced to investigate crimes that don’t exist.
I am fed up with fictional plans when we are told that we need to imprison certain people.
I am fed up with staged crimes designed to put some people in jail.
Continuing with his revelations, Dymovskiy admits putting an innocent person in jail under the pressure from his supervisor:
The director of the Department of Internal Affairs awarded me rank of a major, which I received in May, because I promised him to put an innocent person in jail.
I’m not afraid to say that.
I understand that it can be punishable.
But it is the truth and I admit that.
Dymovsky also appeals to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin urging him to investigate those problems and put an end to the widespread corruption in the police.
The video hit a “viral” stage within hours after its publication with several hundreds of thousands of clicks on YouTube.
It was widely covered by the Russian mainstream media and discussed on the countless blogs.
It is one of the first examples when Russian citizens successfully deploy new media platform to draw attention of the government toward hot issues in the country.
The novelty of “citizen video addresses” in Russia is best indicated by a cautious comment from one of the most popular bloggers in the country dolboeb:
A monologue with enormous force.
I won’t be surprised if it turns out to be a viral marketing.
The character is too out-of-this-word.
Another blogger marchenk writes:
None of us is an angel... I wouldn't admire him as an honest policeman and the lover of the truth (he admits himself that he received the rank of major for putting an innocent person in jail).
However, sincere respect for bravery.
There are honest police officers after all.
Because of them, it makes sense to push forward police reforms.
I hope to God his publicity gives him protection and honest consideration of his situation.
On Sunday, November 8, Rashid Nurgaliev, the Russian minister of internal affairs, announced the audit of police forces in Novorossiysk.
Meanwhile, Dymovskiy has been fired “for libel and actions that damage the honor" of the police.
In his interview to Russian radio station "Ekho Moskvy," Dymovskiy said he had been followed and was considering sending his family to Moscow for security reasons.

In eastern Paraguay, 217 members of the Ava Guaraní indigenous community recently came down with health symptoms that include nausea and headaches.
It is believed that these individuals became sick as a result of intentional aerial spraying with pesticide, after they refused to vacate their ancestral lands. Governmental officials confirm that parts of the indigenous group's land located in the Itakyry district in the Department of Alto Paraná had been sprayed where no crops are present .
Many of the signs point to Brazilian soy growers as those responsible for the spraying, in part because the indigenous community's land is valuable for the crop and that they had been in a dispute with the Ava Guaraní over the ownership of approximately 3,000 hectares , according to the blog Interparaguay .
José Ángel López Barrios of Bienvenidos! describes the isolated community where the incident took place:
A 40-fee Dita Tree became a refuge for 36 members of 7 families in Barangay Bagong Silangan (New East Village), Quezon City, Metro Manila as flood waters rose last September 26.
The flashflood was caused by a record rainfall unleashed by Typhoon Ketsana which hit the Philippines last September.
It was the worst flooding in the country in the past 40 years.
There are only few Dita Trees left in urban Metro Manila.
Barangay Bagong Silangan is an urban poor community located in the northeastern part of the country’s capital.
More than 30 individuals died in this community during the flooding disaster.
Arkibong Bayan provides more details:
36 members of 7 families climbed up this dita tree as the flood waters was rising and were saved.
They stayed on the branches of this tree from 10 AM of Sept. 26 up to 3 AM of the following day when they climbed down with the waters still waist deep because they were cold and hungry for 17 hours.
The oldest was 60 years old and the youngest 2 weeks old Moral lesson: Don't cut trees, they may save your life one day.
(In this case, literally.)
Survivors recounted that there were many big snakes which also sought refuge in the Dita Tree.
Aside from the Dita Tree, there was another tree which residents claimed also saved the lives of other villagers
We were also shown what we now call the “Tree of Life”, the Dita tree where 7 families (34 individuals) sought refuge during the flood and were saved from the raging flood waters.
The surviving residents, who were surveying their homes for repairs, talked of how they climbed from roof to roof seeking higher grounds.
They recounted how they rescued a 2 month old baby on floating aluminum roofing.
Arkibong Bayan received a comment from a reader who shared a similar story about how a mango tree saved lives during a natural disaster three years ago
During the onslaught of Supertyphoon Reming on November 30, 2006, a mango tree saved 5 lives in Padang, Legazpi City (Bicol Region in Luzon Island).
One survivor had two choices: the mango tree or the slab roof of a house.
She chose the tree; those on the slab roof were entirely swept away to the sea.
Lesson: Plant a tree.
It may save your life
After surviving the deadly flood last September, residents of Barangay Bagong Silangan are facing a bigger challenge: rebuilding their homes and their lives.
The community is a changed community.
Houses were swept away and many basic infrastructure were damaged.
We were told that before Ondoy (Typhoon Ketsana) the area was congested like any other urban poor area.
Now, only the relatively sturdy homes survived.

Saudi bloggers are rallying to the support of a fellow blogger who claims that a newspaper had lifted photographs and copy from his blog without permission.
Saudi Jeans' Ahmed Al Omran has little praise for the paper being accused of plagiarism:
Although al-Yaum newspaper has enjoyed a monopoly in the Eastern Province (EP) for a very long time, it remains one of the weakest publications in the country.
I was born and raised in the EP, and I used to read Ashraq al-Awsat, al-Hayat and al-Watan but not al-Yaum.
Al Omran's distaste was further fueled after Saudi Aggie, a student named Nathan at the newly opened King Abdulla University of Science and Technology (KAUST) raised the alarm that the paper had used his photographs and coverage of the recent students elections.
He posts a copy of the clipping from the paper and asks his readers:
I can't believe this!
Look at this article that was published recently in the major Saudi Arabian newspaper, Al Yaum.
Do those pictures look familiar?
How about the words?
If you can't read Arabic, this was taken almost verbatim from my blog post "Elections" published October 7th, 2009.
This can't be legal, not even in Saudi Arabia!
The American student further adds:
If I was in the USA I would file an intellectual property rights case against Al Yaum.
If it was the New York Times that plagiarized my blog I would be rich right now.
Do intellectual rights to published thoughts and photos have any value here?
Al Omran notes:
Nathan is thinking about suing them, which would be awesome, but probably they have already embarrassed themselves enough.
Commentators on Nathan's blog are sympathetic to the blogger's plight.
Mazoo writes:
I'm sorry to see that happening to you ..
however , it's a common thing here in KSA :D ..
I heard about many many cases in which my friends content ( blog entries , pictures and ideas ) have been stolen by some lazy journalists.
They complained about it and some wrote to the chief editor - some of them post an apology and some of them fired the person who stole the content
Al Hanouf, who describes herself as a law student, is seeking justice:
If this action considered under a computer-related crimes , then he - the journalist - should be in jail for more than 6 months and he should pay to you not less than 250,000 SR .
You should go to a lawyer , and please don't end this by emailing the newspaper!
there is a law , and it wouldn't be able to correct the mistakes if we end the issues in our lazy way !
And Chiara advises:
I share in the revulsion for plagiarism, and the common tactic of translating and plariagizing is no better.
You can copyright your whole blog as other bloggers have done, and have your name embedded on the photos.
In a follow up post, Nathan writes:
In Saudi Arabia, gossip spreads like the plague.
This blog has received tens of thousands of new visitors in one week alone.
I came to Saudi Arabia to build bridges, not to make enemies.
I came to study and research at a university which is striving with all of its might to be one of the best research universities in the world, not to get money from people or organizations.
I do want accountability.
What Al Yaum did was wrong, but the tone of the discussion is also wrong.
And his final words to his readers are:
If you want to borrow something from my blog, please ask first.
Nobody, myself included, enjoys misunderstandings.
Using a translation tool, the journalist concerned writes to Nathan stating his case.
The Somali Media Centre is a forum of Somali journalists and bloggers living in Somalia and outside.
The Centre distributes news content and publishes blogs written by journalists.
The Somali Media Centre is an independent forum for the Somali journalists in and outside the country.
It is established to promote the profile of the brave, hardworking journalists who devoted their lives to serve their people worldwide.
Somalia has been dubbed as a failed state, a country associated with death, long running civil strife, warlords, terrorism and modern piracy.
But one of the most successful stories over the years has been the rise of the independent media and freedom of thought.
However, the dedication and reporting of the truth come at a price.
The Centre publishes running blogs by these journalists.
Also, the Centre distributes news content and reports by the journalists.
The Centre coordinates between the Somali and non-Somali journalists.
It gives non-Somali journalists who may be traveling to Somalia with first hand advice and contacts.
The Centre also works with high profile international media organizations in commissioning, producing and filing stories and reports about Somalia and the Horn of Africa region.
Solana Larsen writes about the origin of Somali Media Centre project:
In case you hadn't guessed, I'm not Somali.
In journalism school in London in 2002 I had a classmate named Harun Hassan who I used to ask a lot of questions about life in Mogadishu and Somali politics.
After we graduated, we remained friends and I introduced him to writing for openDemocracy.net where I was a commissioning editor for a few years.
Later on, I became a managing editor at Global Voices Online, where we occasionally also have stories about Somali bloggers.
Harun used to tell me about ideas he had for media projects involving the Somali community in London.
He created a newsletter on paper in Somali, and at one point he approached me about making a website for something he called the Somali Media Centre.
Media coverage of the Somali community in the UK was so negative and inaccurate, Harun felt the only way to correct it, was to make it easier for UK journalists to find Somali journalists and researchers to talk to.
We made a website and blog, but we were soon distracted by other work and the project lay dormant.
The website you are looking at now, is our second attempt at creating a networking tool for Somali journalists and others to use to help improve global understanding of Somalis and Somalia.
Below are some of latest blog posts from The Somali Media Centre:
In a post titled, Affair to Remember, Fathia Absie writes about the conviction of Joshua Asisa, a peace-keeper in Somalia, for engaging in an affair with a young Somali woman:
Military court in Kampala convicted Joshua Asisa to a one-and-half years in prison.
Mr. Asisa who is a member of the AMASOM peace-keepers in Somalia have been found guilty for engaging in an affair with a young Somali woman by the name of Nimco Omar and impregnating her after marrying her under a false pretence by telling her that he was a Muslim.
This story took place last year in Mogadisho but no one heard of it till this young woman went to Kampala and took Mr. Asisa to court for lying to her.
Mohamed Abukar Ahmed who is the Journalist that broke the story has told me that he has learned the story after it was reported by a news paper in Uganda.
After that Mr. Ahmed tried to get in touch with the leaders of the Somali community in Kambala and was able to get in touch with the girl.
He told me that Ms. Omar told him about her story and how she met Mr. Asisa who is doctor.
He was working at a private hospital for the Uganda military in Mogadisho.
"in the spirit of spreading the word..," writes Idil Osman:
The recruitment taking place in the Somali refugee camps in Dadaab, Northeastern Kenya has stirred some controversial outbursts by many in and outside the region.
However what I am particularly bewildered with is the stand-point of the Kenyan government.
I did an investigative report on this issue earlier on at work where the defense minister of Kenya firmly claimed Kenya had not given permission for this recruitment to take place.
Meanwhile witnesses and human rights activists are recording and documenting evidence of these youngsters being put in Kenyan military trucks and driven to Kenyan military training bases.
Many of these youngsters are taken under false pretence and the promise of regular salary and a stable job with a UN/EU/AU backed military project.
In reality they are being recruited to go and fight in the very war they fled from and had turned them into refugees.
Many of these young refugees are reported to be underage and taken without their parents' consent.
It also violated their international human right as refugees according to the recently released Human Rights Watch press release, because refugees are meant to be kept in civilian conditions.
Solana discusses the issue of "unnamed sources" in Western media reports in her post titled "When Local Sources go Unnamed":
just picked up the latest edition of National Geographic Magazine for their story on "Shattered Somalia".
The photos of Mogadishu by Pascal Maitre are beautiful, though they show a lot of destruction.
And the writer, Robert Draper gives a fair and sympathetic summary of a complicated history.
He also definitely makes the challenges of foreign reporting in Somalia clear.
Curiously, Somali journalist Harun Hassan is mentioned by name in a photo caption of a traffic guard in Mogadishu, but as far as I can see nowhere in the text itself.
Why the reluctance to reveal sources?
If Draper has taken the trouble of contacting and interviewing Somali media sources, why not share this information with the readers?
Is this a typical experience of Somali journalists who assist Western journalists with their reporting?
I hope members of the Somali Media Centre will help shed light on what it's like to be on that end of the reporting team.
You can see the list of current members of the Centre here.
An English literature professor from the little Mediterranean city of Tartous and a Syrian-Canadian writer on a trip to her mother country exchange glances at a cafe called Sea Breeze.
That's how Mariyah and Abu Fares chose to start their adventure, and their readers' new addiction.
A low rumble in my stomach broke into my daydream as a waft of spices and seafood drifted enticingly by me.
I felt as though I hadn’t eaten in days.
I looked back through the window and spotted the waitress, resting casually near what appeared to be the kitchen door.
She had been immersed in a book but as though she had a sixth sense, she caught my gaze within seconds of it falling on her.
She smiled knowingly and approached my table.
“Hungry?”
“Oh, yes!
Do you have a menu?”
“Not here.
But I’ll tell you what’s being made fresh today.”
“Oh heaven.”
I thought to myself and smiled back at her, enthusiastically awaiting her description of dinner.
The story starts out as simple as that.
The two writers, who are switching places every week, went from there.
We learn about Yasmina, Prof. Youssef's former student and the waitress at Sea Breeze, and Yazan, the nonchalant chef, all to the backdrop of Tartous' marvelous sea side, and Abu Fares' and Mariyah's exquisite writing.
When Yasmina was introducing herself my eyes were distracted by the other woman.
With delicate fingers, she picked a small hot fish by the tail, dipped it slightly in a bowl of sauce, brought it close to her lips, blew on it to cool it down then swallowed it all, head, bones and tail like a true gourmet.
She closed her eyes and swam in her own pool of ecstasy.
Then… then with her other hand, she pulled at a lock of hair which went astray in front of her face and shepherded it to join the others behind her ear.
It was precisely the way she pulled at her hair that made me utterly defenseless.
We are at Part 16 at the moment, but be sure to catch it from the beginning.
Indonesia has a vibrant blogging scene with a strong emphasis on community.
The annual Blogger Festival (Pestablogger) Indonesia attracted bloggers and tech lovers from all over the vast island nation.

Tunisian blogger Fatma Riahi, who blogs as Fatma Arabicca, has been charged with defamation on her own blog and is now being detained. A group has been formed on Facebook in support of the 34-year-old blogger, who is also being accused of blogging on Debat Tunise (Tunisia Debate).
The start of this year's French literary season saw French-Senegalese novelist and playwright Marie N'Diaye awarded a much-awaited Prix Goncourt.
However, N'Diaye and her family move to Berlin to years ago, in large part because of French president Nicolas Sarkozy's politics.
Last year, the panel of this prestigious award created a sensation when it chose Afghan writer Atiq Rahimi, for his French language novel, Syngué Sabour.
Will this be another opportunity to celebrate diversity in a changing French society?
Or will the moment be spoiled by controversy?
Explains DW-World :
In an interview with "Inrockuptibles" magazine last summer, N'Diaye said she had decided to leave France and move to Berlin in 2007 "in great part because of Sarkozy."
The controversy began after Eric Raoult, a lawmaker and member of Sarkozy's ruling UMP party, wrote to the culture minister last week recommending that NDiaye be reminded of the "duty of restraint" that comes with the Goncourt.
In response, France's cultural establishment has thrown accusations of censorship into the debate.
Bernard Pivot, a Goncourt jury member, accused Raoult of knowing nothing about the literary scene.
N'Diaye, born in 1967 to a French mother and a Senegalese father, won the Goncourt prize for her novel, "Trois femmes puissantes" ("Three Powerful Women"), a story about three women caught between France and Senegal and the hellish ordeal of illegal migration from Africa.
"The story of these migrants has been told many times before, but if this can help people understand their fate a bit better, I will be happy," said NDiaye.
What was it that stirred Eric Raoult's ire?
No less than an interview of the woman novelist, when she answered magazine Les Inrocks's question : "Do you feel well in Sarkozy's France?" saying :
Ugandan politicians are behaving like grasshoppers: "Following the pattern of most dictator regimes coming to an end, Museveni and his collaborators in the armed occupation of Buganda are starting to behave like grasshoppers."
Do all pregnant women deserve equal human rights, or do pregnant women in prison forfeit those rights?
There are a few questions that come to mind regarding a pregnant woman's right to live and to raise her child when she has been convicted for some sort of crime: What is it like for them to be pregnant and have their child behind bars?
Should they be a priority when there are other women outside of correctional facilities without medical assistance?
Should maternity overrule any other legal conditions to ensure a pregnant woman's human rights?
USA: women in labor no longer to be shackled.
What happens to an inmate's baby after childbirth?
Different countries have different regulations regarding children in prisons.
For example, in Argentina, according to Ajintem, an information portal for migration information, a law was passed last year specifying that pregnant women, women with children younger than 5 and those with handicapped children would benefit from spending their prison term at home under house arrest.
This law would benefit not only the mother, who in prison wouldn't receive suitable health care during her pregnancy, but also the child, who would either be raised in an unsafe environment deprived of freedom with deficient health controls and food, or be raised away from the mother, causing another series of problems.
However, the message is for magistrates to follow the spirit of the law and grant this permission to those women not involved in violent crimes, to ensure that the rest of the civilian population doesn't see pregnancy as a get out of jail free card.
In the Canary Islands, according to the Prisiones y Penas blog, which writes about the issues surrounding jails and prisons, women are allowed to keep their children of up to 3 years of age with them in their cells, but in the company of other inmates, which isn't the best environment.
Thus, pregnant women or women with children under 3 are told upon entry to the prison that it isn't good for the child to grow up behind bars, and options are given for them to send the child off to family members.
This is also the case in Peru and Russia.
In the US, there are only two correctional facilities which allow for this, in New York and in Nebraska, as told by renowned photographer Jane Evelyn Atwood in her 3 part photo documentary for Amnesty International, called Too Much Time, where she visited dozens of prisons all over the world to record and document the lives of inmates.
Why does the US correctional system not generally allow women with babies to keep them?
Atwood explains that due to the hostage situation, it is not allowed.
In the Prison Photography Blog they address this claim:
Children are excluded from all but a couple of US prisons.
The security threat is cited as the reason: a child inside a prison is a constant vulnerable life and constant hostage target.
The claim seems a little bogus when penal systems of other countries are brought into consideration.
The Atwood documentary in the Amnesty International site features both a section on the process of giving birth in shackless as told in Vanessa's Baby and another on prison systems and motherhood, with fotographs of the women while the photographer reads an essay on her experiences visiting the prisons and taking the pictures.
Pregnancy as a bargaining tool?
Why are rights for pregnant women in prison so controversial?
In Russia Today, a Russian broadcasting channel, the subject is mentioned when discussing children born and raised in the Russian correctional system:
Skeptics think some mothers deliberately get pregnant simply to ease life in prison.
Hospital leave, then lots of scheduled time with your child – it is all better than sitting in a stone cell, they claim.
And there are women for whom it seems that pregnancy is the only way to escape a sentence, as was the case back in June, when a British woman incarcerated and sentenced to death in Laos due to drug smuggling got pregnant in prison and escaped being executed, since the Laos government would not execute a pregnant woman.
The claims made according to the Daily Express, a British newspaper, are that she got artificially inseminated "to secure a more lenient term".
In their words: Women tell of their children and prison life
Geraldin Rodríguez, an Argentinean spending time in an Ecuadorian jail due to drug trafficking tells Marcos Brugiati, a writer who contributes with the art related online publication Plastica-Argentina, the story about acting and performing in jail, getting pregnant in prison and having her child.
She was allowed to keep her baby with her, but decided that the child needed to grow up free:
During the labor, no one is allowed in the delivery room.
My family didn't even know I was in labor or had her until after I left the hospital.
During the three days some of the guards stayed in the room, but most of the time, when the nurses asked them to sit outside the door, they complied.
I have heard horror stories of women being chained to the delivery bed.
I am so grateful as to have not experienced this.
Most of the nurses treated me as a human instead of a prisoner.
You can read more testimonies about growing up with a parent in prison and the different effects incarcerating women may have on their children in Women and Prison.
So what do you think?
With pregnant women around the world not receiving health care of any sort, should additional efforts be made to benefit women who are in prison?
Is there a difference between mothers serving terms in correctional facilities and those outside?
Should they be treated differently?

The works of Venezuelan artist Jesús Soto (1923 - 2005) are among the most famous representations of Latin American modern art, known mostly for his kinetic works.
Soto was born in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela, where he began working as a painter of cinema posters.
He received his education in the cities of Caracas and Maracaibo, but it was in Paris where his career took a powerful turn.
His most famous works are the “penetrables,” which are interactive sculptures consisting of an array of square, thin, dangling tubes of shiny colors made from plastic and in which the public can walk through.
Photo of a child in a Soto exhibit by Alé and used under a Creative Commons license.
According to the art experts, Soto's art is inseparable from the viewer, who is an active participant of the artist’s piece.
The illusion and the senses are completed by the perceptions of the mind as a result of observing, touching, and becoming part of the piece.
Venezuelan bloggers and the online community in general, celebrate his art through articles, reviews, and videos taken in museums and inside the works themselves, while explaining the meaning of Soto’s works in their culture, landscape and daily life.
In his blog Literanova , Eduardo Casanova goes a bit deeper on Soto’s life and gives an insight of the history of the city he was born:
Berlin Wall by Natalie Maynor
Today is the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a complex security structure that once divided East and West Berlin in Germany.
Today we are showcasing some of the videos from throughout the globe that are being uploaded to commemorate this date and what it meant to barriers not only in Germany, but throughout the world. Krista Schyler also makes the comparison between the Mexico/US wall and the Berlin wall, in this case, not only focusing on the impact on human migration, but from a wildlife conservation angle as well: Image by Natalie Maynor used on post according to Creative Commons Attribution License.

Two different organizations in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are using video tools to help both Arabic and Jewish youth to understand the conflict and bridge gaps between them, creating spaces for interaction and communication where they can share their dreams, concerns and thoughts regarding the complex situation they live in.
One of the initiatives is Sadaka Reut, and this is what they say about their program:
With the majority of Palestinian and Jewish youth physically segregated from one another (in separate communities and schools) and fears, racism and prejudice the result, we look to build alternative models for interaction between the two groups.
The ‘Building a Culture of Peace’ program seeks to create a space in which both Palestinian and Jewish youth may feel equal, respected and recognized as individuals and as national collectives.
The members of their program have also been participating in the One Minute Video Project, where they learn about video activism during a one-week workshop.
Here are some of the results, and you can see the rest by clicking through to their site:
Another initiative is the Windows for Peace project, which started back in 1991 as an effort to produce a bilingual and bicultural magazine for youth as a way for them to connect and learn about the conflict, promote equality and empower youth.
However, it hasn't been easy, as they explain on their site:
It is no simple task for Israeli and Palestinian youth to overcome the vast amount of misinformation and stereotypes they are taught about one another.
The limited availability for interaction, a result of living in mostly segregated communities and exacerbated by the ongoing violent political conflict, perpetuates the historical fears, prejudice, and hatred that divide the two peoples.
Windows is therefore dedicated to fostering large scale change in the way Israeli and Palestinian youth see themselves, "the other" and the conflict.
Participants in Windows programs go through experiences that promote conflict transformation among both peoples, towards a peaceful reality with which both sides can live.
We believe that a just and lasting peace must be based on democratic values, human rights, and mutual knowledge and acceptance of “the other.”
They are also working on a new initiative called Through the Lens, where 15 to 17 year old youth who "graduate" from the magazine continue developing skills to create short films, news pieces and other video productions to further "productive, peace-building dialogue and positive interaction".
As the children in the video state in so many words: they may have a hard time dealing with many of the opinions and perceptions other children express, but having the space to discuss issues in a safe and secure manner helps them understand the world they live in with a possibility to interact, learn and share with other children and youth and even change these perceptions.
On the evening of November 6, Babalú blog linked to a post by Penultimos Dias (es) reporting that a number of prominent Cuban bloggers, including Yoaní Sánchez and Global Voices contributor Claudia Cadelo, were detained by state security forces.
An update from Penultimos Días reported that Sanchez and Orlando Luis Pardo were "verbally abused and severely beaten".
Did you know that at this very moment many universities throughout Europe are occupied by students?
Thousands of them are sleeping, cooking, debating and partying in their auditoriums to protest against the under-financing of the educational system and the so-called Bologna Process, a European Union education policy.
What is so special about these protests is the fact that they have not been centrally coordinated by student unions but have been organized entirely bottom-up, with the help of online social media.
It all started in Vienna, Austria on October 22, when a small group of students met for a flashmob in the city center to protest, and then headed to University of Vienna where they spontaneously occupied the Auditorium Maximum.
By the time police arrived, the news of the occupation had already circulated on Twitter, mobilizing so many supporters it was impossible to clear the hall.
Unsereuni websiteWithin days, the occupiers - to their own surprise - put in place a remarkable organizational structure: Mobilization and communication was organized via the Twitter "hashtags" #unibrennt and #unsereuni ("university on fire" and "our university").
A 24h webcast from the Auditorium Maximum was put in place.
Organizational tasks from cooking to cleaning were structured via a wiki, and a website communicated with the public.
Twitter, blogs and Facebook (32,400 fans so far) were used to spread the word.
This had two effects:
- For the first time protests of this scale did not need the support of mass media for mobilization.
Within less than a week after the beginning of the protests more than 20,000 demonstrators roamed the streets of Vienna, preceding any mass media coverage.
Media contacts were limited to a bare minimum (which produced much confusion).
Students simply didn‘t need the media and since the protests lacked hierarchy, there was a shortage of spokespersons.
- Second, because everyone could follow what was going on inside the Auditorium Maximum (the webcast produced half a million views within one month) it kept the tabloid press from labeling the protesters as rioters or extremists.
Too many people knew it wasn‘t true.
The power of opinion-making had shifted.
Soon the protests infected other university cities in Austria and abroad: Today, less than a month and a half after the first protests, almost 100 universities in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Albania, Serbia, France, Italy, Croatia and the Netherlands are occupied or have seen other forms of mass protest.
Gerald Bäck of Bäck Blog, who works in the media observation business, found out that the gross reach of the tweets, i.e. the unique number of followers exposed to them, was 386,860.
His analysis shows who the key influencers were, what URLs were most linked to and what hashtags were used most.
In his blog, smime, Michael Schuster who is specialist in semantic analysis, contributed an overview of the "old media" covering the events.
He counted 2,700 articles and identified four trends lasting roughly one week each: "Protests take place", "protests continue", "protests widen", and recently, "ok, enough now."
Luca Hammer of 2-Blog, a student and technical mastermind behind the Viennese web activities, has published a field report of how wikis, Twitter and webcast were used to get things rolling.
It looks like the case of #unibrennt may become an early milestone in the transformation of Austrian politics by the use of online social media.
It has created wide attention - and confusion - among established media and political structures, and created a spirit of empowerment among students and digital leaders.

At the end of November, two separate but somehow connected protest movements arose on the Brazilian blogosphere and twittersphere.
One of them called on all bloggers to support a campaign of mass un-subscription to the largest Brazilian newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, and its website UOL.
The second was a demonstration in front of the headquarters of the same media group, organized by the "Medialess Movement" headed by Cidadania blog, against a perceived bias and news manipulation of the Folha group.
Both the boycott campaign and the demonstration were sparked by the newspaper's latest alleged attempt at character assassination against Brazilian president Lula da Silva, this time by publishing an article by César Benjamin, an ex-ally and current Folha columnist, claiming that Lula admitted in 1994 he had attempted to sexually subdue a fellow inmate when jailed for political crime in the 80's. With the denial of the other people present at the said conversation and even those jailed with Lula during the dictatorship, including the said assaulted inmate, the author of the article apologised for any offense and the newspaper was forced to publish new stories denying the allegations a few days later.
Nevertheless, both movements converged as a larger protest organized through the blogosphere against what many call "PIG", an acronym for the Coupist Press Party a term coined to describe the biased Brazilian media that serves political interests.
Twitter users @Dolphindiluna and @Aritana designed badges initially posted on the Arlesophia, Blog do Tsavkko and Maria Frô blogs, inviting readers to un-subscribe to the media group.
These banners were spreading quickly on the blogosphere, when Folha sent a warning to cyberactivist and blogger Antonio Arles, claiming inappropriate use of the group's trade marks:
Arles briefly explains the situation and says he believes he has been intimidated by the largest Brazilian newspaper:
Canada said what?
The Canadian government supposedly released an angry statement today, denouncing a spoof that supposedly made it as far as the Wall Street Journal claiming that Canada had shifted its policy and would be agreeing to greenhouse gas reduction targets and drafting a plan for a climate adaptation fund for developing nations.
In fact, it looks like all of it is phishy, including the Wall Street Journal article (note, the URL is europe-wsj.com and the writer seems non-existent).
According to Jason Linkins at Huffington Post the denouncement itself is also a spoof.
Confusing things further, it appears there is even a third fake release that has been sent to apologize for the confusion, leaving many people wondering what is real and what is not.
There's still no official confirmation of who is behind the prank, but it closely resembles previous actions by The organizers of the prank are The Yes Men who've earned global notoriety for publicly humiliating corporations and governments, often by putting out false statements in their name.
A spoof website called www.enviro-canada.ca explains Canada's new supposed policies.
Spoof Canada website
According to the fake denouncement, the Canadian government was especially frustrated that the news of their change of heart had been met so positively by developing nations at the United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP15) in Copenhagen.
They provided a link to a video of an impassioned statement by Margaret Matembe, MP and member of the Climate Committee of Uganda (a non-existent person) with a fake Canadian official sitting by her side.
UPDATE: The true identity of the Ugandan delegate is revealed in this video.
Although the website where the video is posted appears very official it has a different URL (cop-15.org) from the actual United Nations website (cop15.dk).
Whoever is behind the spoof, is effectively playing on the disbelief that many activists already feel at the failure of world leaders to take definitive action on climate change.
A clever spoof - fake Ugandan delegate makes impassioned statement
This past Sunday on Nov. 1, Beijing saw its earliest snowfall in 22 years.
The sudden change in weather, which blanketed the entire city in snow, surprised many residents.
But the news media later reported that the snowfall had actually been enhanced by the city’s weather modification office.
The reasoning behind the forced precipitation was because Beijing had been experiencing a drought.
The night before the snow, the government had fired silver iodide into the skies.
The resulting effect increased the amount of snow by 16 million tons.
“We won’t miss any opportunity of artificial precipitation since Beijing is suffering from the lingering drought,” said Zhang Qiang, the head of the weather modification office, to the state media.
China has a history of artificially inducing rain, usually in cases to stop drought.
At other times, the weather modification office has reduced the rain to ensure clear skies, such as during the National Day parade in October or the Beijing Olympic Games.
Netizens have been divided in their opinions about this past weekend’s man-made snow.
Some wrote gleefully about its beauty, like blogger, 鱼干儿.
The drought has affected 800,000 hectares of farmland by the end of October, official sources estimated, and the snow storm was said to be a much-needed boon to local farmers.
But not all farmers in the region benefited.
One possible side effect of weather modification is that it diverts precipitation from other regions that need it too, for the sake of creating stronger storms in a focused area.
Other netizens have poked fun at the snow.
Elizabeth Kain wrote on her blog:
Yesterday's snow was the earliest in ten years.
I am sure my mother, who sat in the Beijing Airport for 7 hours as all flights in and out of the city were disrupted or cancelled, would be happy to know her inconvenience was state induced.
Another comment about the snow also made an astute observation:
Martin M. November 2, 2009 3:30 pm Everything is made in China, even snow.
YANG Yuanyuan, a 30-year-old postgraduate at Shanghai Maritime University, hanged herself in her bathroom on November 25.
She told her mother that knowledge cannot change destiny on the day before she committed suicide.
Recent years have seen an increasing number of suicides committed by Chinese university students, in particular among postgraduates and doctors.
In Shanghai city 2008, there were 23 college student suicide cases, resulted in 19 deaths.
In Guangdong 2008, there were 26 suicide cases, resulted in 21 deaths.
What are the reasons behind all these suicide cases?
Yang's case may shed some lights on the problem faced by our social elites.
According to report from 163.com, Yang came from a single parent family.
She and her brother was brought up by her mother and they worked hard to climb up the social ladder through education - Yang was pursuing her Master’s degree in Shanghai and her brother is pursuing his Doctor’s at Peking University.
Ever since Yang's mother had been laid off from the factory, she stayed with her daughter in the dormitory in the Wuhan University where she had her undergraduate study.
She worked for two years to payback all the debts before she decided to continue her post-graduate study in Shanghai.
With little saving, she tried to apply for an extra bed for her mother in the school dormitory, but they were insulted for their rural identity.
The warden even refused Yang's mother from entering the dormitory.
Yang's death has received a lot of echoes from the Internet as it has become more and more difficult for people with high education achievement to attain the social status that they struggle for.
The magic of university diploma is vanishing.
Blogger Hailing, who is sympathetic to Yang, muses about the asymmetry between education achievement and salary in Chinese society in her article who should bear the responsibility for poor postgraduate Yang Yuanyuan’s death?:
Yesterday, thousands of Iranians took to the street to protest against dictatorship.
The protest reminded Chinese people of the Tiananmen democracy movement back in 1989 and Chinese twitterers are using hashtag #cn4iran to show solidarity with Iranian fellows.
A recent case of forced demolition has raised attention to the protection of citizens’ rights and fair conflict resolution in China.
On 13 November this year, the forcible demolition of a private building, ordered by the Chengdu local government, led to the suicide of one of its owners, Tang Fuzhen, who poured gasoline and set fire on herself.
The house stands in the way of a district government’s project to link two roads.
Comparisons were made with a case that happened last year, where a woman in the Minhang district of Shanghai threw self-made petrol bombs at a demolition crew preparing to destroy her house, which is the site of a transportation hub for the 2010 Shanghai Expo.
Site of former home of Tang Fuzhen
Cases like these are known as ‘nail houses’, referring to homeowners who refuse to move from demolition zones, usually because of disagreement with the compensation offered.
The most famous one was the Chongqing nail house case in 2007, when a Chinese couple reached negotiated agreement with the developer after 3 years of standoff.
In a recent blog post, well-known blogger Wuyuesanren (五岳散人) compared the peaceful resolution of the Chongqing nail house case with the violent incidents last month:
On December 22, the Ecuadorian television channel Teleamazonas was taken off the air by the Superintendent of Telecommunications , under a provisional suspension of 72 hours.
Teleamazonas is a channel that has been characterized as one that does not follow the official governmental line.
During those 3 years, it has maintained strong discrepancies with President Rafael Correa's regime, which has called many times for the closing of the television channel.
The Superintendent of Telecommunications justified the channel's closing because of the events of May 22, 2009, when it spread news based on assumptions regarding the exploitation of gas on the Puná Island that will affect the residents of the island, who make a living in the fishing industry.
According to the Superintendent, upon spreading the news, Teleamazonas violated Article 18, Number 1 of the current Constitution that establishes the right of all persons to "look for, receive, exchange, produce and spread true, verified, timely, diverse, uncensored facts, events, and general interest processes is and with ulterior responsibility."
Soon after, there were voices of protest from different sectors in Ecuador, which are also planning marches and protests against the measure.
For many, it is an attack on freedom of expression.
This recent event is also relevant just as the members of the National Congress are debating the new Communications Law, which was made known after dissolving a previous agreement between assembly members from the governmental party and opposition.
There are also online opinions for and against the government measure.
For many, the closing of the television channel is a clear attack on free press and it also becomes an intimidating act.
For Xica of the blog La Alharaca :
Lucas Liganga writes about Ethiopian Prime Ministers's betrayal: "Unfortunately, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi who is the spokesman of Africa on climate change uncharacteristically teamed up with France and heavily doctored the African document, a move that shocked the African negotiators."
Thoughts on Ghana's looming oil woes: "To preface, I should state that I believe in property rights, limited government and free enterprise, although I must say that oil agreements aren't easy to deal with, especially when property rights are involved."
When UK firm Tullow Oil announced its discovery of 600 million barrels of oil in Ghana in 2007, the blogosphere responded with variegated tones of hope and cynicism.
After two years since the detection, the country has begun to prepare for oil production, but the current discussion hovers around the questions: “Who benefits and what could be the future ramifications of decisions made by Ghana’s leaders today?”
Charles Crawford, at Blogoir, commented on a piece written by Craig Murray analyzing the cause and effect of Ghana’s oil find.
He wrote this about Murray’s article:
At the same time, revenue must urgently be directed to rural infrastructure, to increasing farm prices and developing agro-processing industry, on a scale not previously attempted.
Ghana already has a major problem keeping young people in farming.
Think how much this will worsen when oil starts to flow.
Why should young people stay on farms now that the country is going to get rich?
Ghana as the anti-Nigeria, ie a new hi-tech Singapore-style place rather than a typical agriculture exporting African country?
Is not the point of acquiring such largesse that it gives a country the chance to look at quite different options, not merely ways to impose top-down solutions based on old ideas?
A comment posted in response to the blogger’s statement by someone named Craig Murray read:
Because William Cobbett Was Right!
Crawford’s remark about the youth still working on farms, despite the country’s apparent road to riches, has been on the minds of Ghanaians.
Ghana Pundit posted a piece by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) which addressed similar concerns:
Dr. Edward Omane Buamah, Deputy Minister of Environment, Science and Technology, has observed that the oil and gas find in the Western Region, has made unemployment among the youth in the area a big issue.
Speaking at a special hearing on the Environmental Impact Assessment for the development of the first phase of the Jubilee Oil Fields, organised for the Western Region House of Chiefs in Sekondi, he said the region had not benefited from natural endowments like the sea, gold, bauxite, timber and other minerals.
Dr. Buamah said it was therefore normal for the youth to expect better employment prospects from Ghana's oil find.
He said direct employment into the upstream oil industry required high level of professional competence and qualification, hence the need for the youth to improve themselves to be able to take full advantage of the numerous ancillary job opportunities, which would be generated by the emerging industry.
Ghana Pundit posted another article that touched upon a new area of concern:
Ghana’s oil find if not properly managed could spell crisis comparable to what is happening in Nigeria’s restive Niger Delta region.
A respected legal practitioner and lecturer at the University of Ghana, Law Faculty, Dr. Raymond Atuguba has chillingly revealed that militants in the Niger Delta region, notorious for blowing up oil pipes, kidnapping and demanding huge ransoms and causing unrest in the oil rich Nigerian region have started tripping to Ghana in droves.
Dr. Atuguba in an interview on the Citi Breakfast Show on Wednesday said the essence of militants' interest in Ghana is to mentor folks in the Western Region of Ghana, on whose offshore, the country will be drilling oil to be protective of their interest.
A blog entry posted on President Atta Mills’ official campaign site stated:
President John Evans Atta Mills on Thursday reminded Kosmos Energy, one of the companies involved in the nation’s oil find in the Jubilee Fields of Cape Three Points, to be mindful of social, legal and corporate responsibilities so that local people would be part of the process and feel its benefits.
He urged the company to make use of available Ghanaian expertise as well as insulate the people against any challenges that would emanate from the drilling of oil.
A comment, in response to this post, by Ofori Amooako Elijah read:
The drilling of the oil must benefit the people of Ghana more especially, it should a step in creating employment.
In the months leading to the election of President John Evans Atta Mills, many Ghanaians, including those abroad, feared that a New Democratic Congress (NDC) win would morph into another reign by the party’s founder and former military ruler, President Jerry John Rawlings.
The transition was smooth, and the relationship between Presidents Rawlings and Mills, seemed cordial.
JJ Rawlings, an unofficial blog site created to highlight the work and thoughts of the former president posted a positive report on May 18, 2009 about President Rawlings’ trip to South Africa on behalf of President Mills.
It reported:
President Mills thanked President Rawlings for representing Ghana at the inauguration and assured him that there would be follow up measures to take advantage of the opportunities for mutually beneficial relations between Ghana and South Africa.
But lately, tensions have been rising between President Mills and other members of the NDC party including President Rawlings.
Ato Kwamena Dadzie recently wrote in his post, "A President Under Siege":
President Mills is under siege.
No doubt about that.
He has become such an easy target that an increasing number of people are baying to take a hit at him.
What is most intriguing is that the heaviest hitters are people within his own party.
The opposition can take a vacation.
Just last week, it was the majority leader in parliament, Alban Bagbin.
He said the president, who likes to portray himself as a humble sheep, has surrounded himself with aides and confidantes who behave like foxes, hyenas and lions.
These people, according to Mr. Bagbin, tend to intimidate and harass anyone who tries to offer some useful counsel to the president.
Days before Mr. Bagbin’s comment, the man who transformed the then Prof. Mill from a taxman to a politician, Jerry John Rawlings, and a group of constituency chairmen of the ruling party were expressing indignation at how the president been conducting himself in office.
Mr. Rawlings believes strongly that his protégé has employed incompetent ‘bastards’ who have taken advantage of their proximity to power to satisfy their selfish interests.
A blog entry posted early this year on Vibe Ghana reported that:
Kwesi Pratt, social critic and Managing Editor of The Insight, has taken a swipe at former President Jerry John Rawlings for putting spokes in the smooth running of the administration of President John Evans Atta Mills.
According to him, Jerry Rawlings’ utterances about the administrative style of the current president are not only embarrassing, but also insulting to the intelligence of the law professor.
A comment in response to this post by someone named Prince, said:
I think ex-President Rawlings would do himself and the NDC party a world of good if he behaves in a more stately manner—after all it's just a probation period of 4years-any impression of Atta Mills being a stooge and not his own man would spell doom for the NDC party as a whole and Rawlings in particular.
Ghana Pundit recently posted an article about President Rawlings’ response to the current debate:
It would be out of place to allow the NPP that has been rejected by Ghanaians to tell us what we should do.
If all members of the NDC and the Members of Parliament have openly come out to express their feelings, then the NPP that has been rejected would have nothing to say.
The same post included a comment by Kofi Adams, spokesman for the former president:
Mr. Kofi Adams said Rawlings believes there is need for individuals within the party to hold the government and its appointees accountable instead of their opponents in the New Patriotic Party (NPP).
Adams goes on to say:
It is good for the party.
It will be bad for the NPP to tell us what to do after they have been rejected and if all party legislators and others have come to the realization to let President Mills know about the feelings of party members and Ghanaians, it is good for us.
This is because, if we allow the NPP to continue to tell us, it would be like a university graduate being corrected by class six pupils.

Our journalists have failed us, when NPP set up an employment agency in their Greater Accra Regional office and used it to get their foot-soldiers employed nobody asked questions(find out from Kojo Asante-CDD).
Go check the loan defaulters of NPP's MASLOC and LEAP credit facilities and it would shock you that they are all card-bearing NPP supporters.
NDC supporters are aware of all the above machinations of the NPP and it would be suicidal for Mills to ignore those who fought hard for him to become president.
The way Mills manages the aspirations of his own supporters and Ghanaians in general is the solution to these problems.
However, let me state that, some of the NDC Gurus are behaving like children.
Words like Mediocre, Team B and Greedy Bastards are coming from ourselves.
I am well-paid but I just won't allow my boss to insult me everyday.
Does anyone believe that under JJ, every NDC foot-soldier was o.k., certainly not but no-one incited them against him.
I can agree that Mills has been slow on only one thing, that is, not arresting Molbila's killers earlier in January 2009 only for one of them to run away.
Mills would succeed and this cycle of voilence visited on defeated parties after elections would cease.
Ato Kwamena responded saying:
This country is not for any group of soldiers - be they on foot or in humvees!
After all the NPP did (who didn't know MASLOC and LEAP were for partisan sorts?) their foot soldiers complained that Kufuor didn't do enough for them.
What do they want?
A gold concession or the oil fields?
Nominations open today (December 29, 2009) for the Breaking Borders Award, a new prize created by Google and Global Voices to honor outstanding web projects initiated by individuals or groups that demonstrate courage, energy and resourcefulness in using the Internet to promote freedom of expression.
The award is also supported by Thomson Reuters.
The Breaking Borders Award builds upon the values expressed in the Global Voices Manifesto, the document co-written on a wiki in 2004 to articulate the guiding principles of the organization and community that would come to be known as Global Voices.
The Manifesto opens with the words:
“We believe in free speech: in protecting the right to speak — and the right to listen.
To that end, we seek to enable everyone who wants to speak to have the means to speak — and everyone who wants to hear that speech, the means to listen to it.”
The Breaking Borders Award also complements the work of Global Voices Advocacy, which was formed in February 2007 to bring focus to the organization's freedom of expression-related activities.
The Breaking Borders Award is open to people of all nationalities.
Winners will be selected by a panel of experts in the field of freedom of expression.
A cash prize of $10,000 will be awarded in each of three areas:
1
Advocacy, given to an activist or group that has used online tools to promote free expression or encourage political change
2
Technology, given to an individual or group that has created an important tool that enables free expression and expands access to information
3
Policy, given to a policy maker, government official or NGO leader who has made a notable contribution in the field
Nominations for the Breaking Borders Award can be submitted at http://www.breakingborders.net and close on February 15, 2010.
Julio Roberto Prado is a Guatemalan lawyer, who frequently investigates and prosecutes cases of human trafficking, in particular, abuse against women and children.
He blogs under a pseudonym, which allows him to show an inside look at the difficult situations of the victims.
This recent post on his blog Noticias Para Dios describes some of the sights and sounds of a typical day in his work , where he requests a search warrant from a judge.
His post also reveals how working a stressful and draining environment like this can affect the morale of those working to end human trafficking and abuse.
Dadis Camara, a Guinean military officer who seized power last December in a coup, was shot yesterday by one of his aides and has been evacuated to Morocco.
According to several news sources, Captain Dadis Camara, leader of the military junta which seized power in Guinea in December 2008, was shot and wounded by one of his aides yesterday in Conakry.
The leader of the de facto government of Guinea, shunned by the international community since the September 28th killing and rape of opposition protesters by soldiers, was flown to Morocco, where he arrived at around 3 P.M. GMT.
Major Kélétigui Camara, General Secretary of the Presidency, said in a phone interview with the guineenews.org website that two people, whose names he did not know, were killed.
Two other junta members were also evacuated to Morocco.
On the spot in Conakry, the situation seems to be quiet, according to several sources as well as phone calls made by this author to newspapers and the government.
However, no one has a clue about the seriousness of the junta leader's wounds.
Someone from an international organization told me Captain Camara might be wounded in the head or neck.
Some preliminary reactions to the news on the RFI website showed a range of opinion.
One anonymous reader writes:
Earlier today, Prita Mulyasari, a housewife who was prosecuted for writing a complaint email regarding a bad hospital service, was found guilty for defaming a private hospital by the Tangerang High Court.
The court ordered her to pay a fine of Rp. 204 M (US$ 21,680) to OMNI Internasional Alam Sutera hospital.
Salary of a factory worker in Jakarta is roughly US$ 106 per month.
Indonesian net users are buzzing to collect the sum in form of coins because they are outraged by the court decision and they hope the coins will overwhelm the hospital, said one activist to local newspaper Kompas.
"When justice is spared, we collect coins", says tagline of Koin Keadilan, coins for justice, a new website dedicated to collect coin donation to pay Prita's fine.

An online declaration on the site says:
Treespotter: Dear All, drop a coin for Prita - drop a coin for common sense.
Or lots of coins.
She needs 2,5 tons of it. http://koinkeadilan.com/
el15abeth: Social media does not expire..we know Prita is innocent.
The verdict will only give Omni hospital a bad rep. #freeprita
Thousands of protesters defied the Islamic regime today by protesting during Student Day, chanting slogans against Ali Khamenei, the leader of the Islamic Republic, and protesting the government's foreign policy.
They also burned photos of Iranian leaders.
According to several news websites, security forces clashed with students and arrested some of them.
As usual, Iranian citizens covered today's event and let the world learn about it.
"What has happened to oil money"
At the University of Tehran, protesters chanted "Death to the dictator" and "What has happened to the oil money?
It is in the pocket of Basijis (Islamic militias)."
"Military force support support"
At Amir Kabir University, also in Tehran, the students chanted slogans such as: "Down with the dictator", "Military force support, support," and "Do not be afraid".
Down with Khamenei in the streets of Tehran Remember the Martyrs
Elmo Sanat University in Tehran marched with Kianoush Asa's photo, a student who was murdered by security forces in the summer of 2009.
Protesters demonstrated in several other cities such as Mashad.
... and Kerman where they chanted "Sweeper brother take Mahmoud "

In what some geologists have described as rare occurrences, Malawi's northern district of Karonga has in the past three weeks experienced a total of 30 earthquakes resulting in at least 5 deaths, over 200 people injured and over 3,000 made homeless.
Fresh reports say another earthquake hit Karonga Sunday 27th December and more are expected.
Since Malawi's president Bingu wa Mutharika declared Karonga as a national disaster area, appeals for help to the victims have been pouring to help the people in the uranium mining district.
Bloggers have also been quick to share their reactions.
A question that lingers on the minds of many Malawians is the cause of the earthquakes.
In a well-detailed post titled The missing Pieces of the Karonga Earthquake Puzzle, Muza Gondwe attempts to raise and answer the question:
The first quake struck on the evening of Sunday 6thgovernment and Red Cross are providing assistance to the victims of the earthquake but equally the government should also provide answers as to what happened?
Do people understand what causes earthquakes: do they deem it an act of God, punishment from angry ancestors, or a sign of the end of days?
December, then a larger quake the next morning, followed by a series of aftershocks in the Karonga District of Northern Malawi.
The ground was shaking as far as Mzuzu 150km away with the biggest quake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale.
My parents who live in Rumphi between Mzuzu and Karonga, ran out of the house during each tremor wondering whether this was final days.
Twelve tremors were felt across three days.
Homes and buildings have been damaged, one fatality when a child died after a wall fell on him.
While Muza tries to provide the geological perspective, Ndagha shares his frustrations with the non-response of Malawi's political parties which he claims could have poured into Karonga if it were campaign time.
Is it that the parties do not have the money to give out to the victims or the area is not campaign friendly?
I remember that earlier in the campaign period for 2009 elections, politicians competed against each other by out-giving money to Ndirande market fire “victims” in Blantyre.
You may wish to note that no one was reported dead or even injured yet the victims got over 5 million Kwacha in total.
Compare that with Karonga when only 2.5 million Kwacha was given by Dr Bingu wa Mutharika!
Come on parties, be responsible and demonstrate that you are who you claim.
This is when your electorate reallyneeds you.
Meanwhile the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Environment has dispelled rumors that the Karonga earthquakes have been caused by the mining works at Kayerekera which is 35 km away from the district heaquarters.
The ministry says that the uranium mine is an open pit and has no underground activities hence has no connection to the earthquakes.
Just before the earthquakes in northern Malawi, Malawi was experiencing four major economic challenges surrounding fuel, forex, power and water.
These left blogger Austin Madinga wonder if Malawi leadership was learning anything from the happenings:
We have water shortages in Blantyre, power and fuel shortages country wide and a general lack of foreign exchange.
Left unchecked these can have debilitating effects on our economic growth.
Various players have promised to resolve or ease the current pressures but when?
The question I keep asking myself is will Malawians will come out of all these events any smarter?
On fuel crisis, journalist Richard Chirombo tried to put the situation into historical perspective by pointing out that Malawi cargo was stuck in Mozambique due to a decline in the use of the Beira port.
MALAWI has for the past ten years registered a sharp decline in the use of Beira Port in Mozambique, according to traffic statistics sourced from the port’s authority.
A report from Cornelder de Mozambique, the company that won a 25 year-long concession from the Government of Mozambique in 1998 to run the port, points to a sharp decline in the use of the port by Malawian exporters and importers.
It says, for instance, that, while the country’s imports and exports traffic amounted to 570 million metric tonnes in 1998- and went on to reach a 1, 3 million metric tonnes peak in traffic in 2002- Malawi has failed to beat its own record peak of 2006.
The fuel importers and governments of Malawi and Mozambique blamed each other for the fuel crisis that hit Malawi for a consecutive four weeks plus in November and December.
A veteran journalist-blogger is being sued for libel by a politician who is known for espousing press freedom in Malaysia.
Zaid Ibrahim, former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, was offended by a blog article written by A Kadir Jasin last October.
Aside from suing the blogger, Zaid wants the writer to apologize.
What is peculiar in this case is that Zaid is known for supporting Malaysian bloggers who have been sued by powerful individuals and corporations.
Zaid himself is also a blogger.
In fact, he made a rebuttal to the “offensive” article written by Jasin in his own blog.
Rocky's Bru is surprised that Zaid is now part of an elite group of individuals who are suing bloggers
I can't explain how Zaid Ibrahim, whom I once described as "maverick", has gone down this way.
Now Zaid has joined the queue of influential and wealthy individuals who are suing bloggers.
With his latest action, I no longer want to describe Zaid as a "maverick".
A maverick is unique, someone who dares go against the flow, a person you respect - even grudgingly - for his principles.
Mat Cendana is worried that the case may lead to more defamation suits in Malaysia
In my opinion, this post, while certainly not flattering to Zaid, isn’t of “saman class” – heck, if this is ruled as defamation, then we’ll see at least 10 such cases being filed at the courts daily!
Jebat is questioning the basis for filing the suit:
What is so wrong about the article which made him issue a writ of summon to Kadir Jasin?
Is there any element of defamation in it?
Didn’t Zaid write a few allegatory statements concerning Kadir Jasin in his own rebuttal as well?
So, what is the contentious issue?
All of Pakatan Rakyat supporters are supporting Zaid Ibrahim anyway.
Who cares if one negative article was published in blogosphere?
You mean to say, people cannot write whatever they want?
Since when?
When he and all the opposition bloggers write tremendous amount of unfair accusations and uncouth articles defaming everyone else, it is fine.
But when one is confronted with a ghost from the past, he became rattled and couldn’t sleep peacefully.
The irony is, he would like to be seen as liberal and the fighter of press freedom and freedom of speech.
Nevertheless, it is his right to sue people as much as it was Kadir Jasin’s right to write that article.
Unlike some people who ran away like a coward, I am sure Kadir Jasin will commence all the necessary legal actions to defend his article based on any evidence that he can produce.
At bigdogdotcom, the writer is disappointed that Zaid is using the case to gain political and media mileage
What Zaid is trying to achieve is unclear.
Obviously, since joining PKR, Zaid how has been infected with the acute ‘Suit Syndrome’ that only Former-Abuse-of-Power Anwar “Mat King Leather” Ibrahim suffer.
Now Zaid has been infected with the Acute Lackofattentionitis dissease.
How far can Zaid go with this is also unclear.
Obviously, he needed the media and legal circus to make himself ‘relevant’ to stay on visible
Maoist night protest.

Nepal's fragile peace process is faltering amidst increasing clashes between the Maoists and the government.
Unhappy with President Ram Baran Yadav's decision to reinstate sacked Army Chief Rookmangud Katwal (Katwal was sacked by then Maoist led government), the former rebels launched massive protest across the nation.
Their main demand being "re-establishment of people's supreme authority", where they seek to curtail the President's authority as he is not an elected official.
They have just announced third round of protest activities, after the first two round failed to produce any results.
Nepali language blog Mysansar has a brief outline of the protest programs Maoists are planning to launch. "Maoists who have been protesting on the streets and in the parliament demanding the President correct his decision have announced programs which have brought relief and some confusion.
United Nations has expressed concerns, writes blogger Mohan Nepali at GroundReport, over the way government and the Maoists seem to ignore the promises made when signing the peace agreement in 2006. "UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) today strongly urged Nepali political forces, including those in government, to make sure that human rights of all people are protected.
It has called on both Nepal government and Maoist protesters not to resort to any violence since it may jeopardize the very peace process going on since 2006.
The OHCHR expressed its concern on the likelihood of violence in the name of Maoist protests and subsequent government actions"
Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal is under a lot of pressure to resolve the conflict with the Maoists but so far he has been unable to placate the former guerrillas.
Maila Baje at Nepali Netbook says that Mr. Nepal's latest attempt to end the stand-off with the Maoist has failed to make any waves:
"Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal warned the other day that the constituent assembly could be dissolved. But the parliament that the elected body doubles as wouldn’t be, he was quick to clarify.
If the prime conciliator was expected to attempt a middle way out of our deepening deadlock, he did not disappoint.
Especially since he passed the buck to President Ram Baran Yadav."
Krishna Hari Pushkar, who works for Nepal's Ministry of Home Affairs, puts part of the blame for the faltering peace process on "foreign actors":
"It is seen that all internal and external peace actors are visibly performing against the ethics of peace process and bouncing beyond the edge of comprehensive peace accord.
So, how can Nepal's peace process go normally in such situation towards its expected end?
Forlornly, it is hapless to describe that no any single direct and indirect actors found sincere and practically committed towards the success of ongoing peace process of Nepal.
If the situation continues, it won't be surprising when the moist battalions decide to return jungle or government imposes special op against ethno-political combatants.
It is unfortunate that some vested politicians' declares that re-insurgency or re-warfare is held in search of peace, however it has proved blunder to impel for “breach peace for peace”.
So far the protest rallies have been peaceful, in some places colorful and musical.
Here is a short video of once such protest rally.
Now that the Maoists have decided to launch second round of protests and are threatening to go on strike for an indefinite period if their demands are not fulfilled, it seems that the drama will continue for a while.
As the world's nations gather today in Copenhagen for the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, Madagascar, having already lost 90% of its original forest, faces continued threats from black market logging.
An illegal traffic of rosewood, a topic of conversation in the Malagasy mediasphere for a few months, has now been thoroughly exposed by an undercover team of investigators.
The details of this very profitable traffic have been made public and shared by many citizen bloggers and scientific publications.
The latest report produced by Global Witness and Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) states that about $460,000 USD worth of trade is cut down each day, with enforcement efforts hampered by the continued absence of a government of national unity.
The full report is available here (and in French here).
names of perpetrators and the volume of the illegal traffic.
Malagasy blogger Achille quotes from the report (fr):
After a coup in March, the new and weakened government of Andry Rajoelina issued sweeping decrees allowing the harvest and export of wood from protected forests and World Heritage Sites.
The Obama administration has condemned the de facto government, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and Conservation International have denounced the wholesale exploitation of some of the world's most diverse forests and decimation of the local population's resources and livelihoods
The rosewood scandal have now had a serious impact in the political process of Madagascar.
Former president Albert Zafy threatened to disclose names in the current Rajoelina government if a solution to unblock the deadlock over the government of national union is not found soon.
The necessity to reach a government of national union is also pressed on by the conditionality of foreign investments by the United States ( AGOA and MCC) and the European Union (fr) (NB: 70% of the Malagasy government budget come from foreign aid).
Interestingly, this decree allowed for the legal investigation of Gibson guitars.
Their headquarters were raided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service because the guitars were made from rosewood from the illegal traffic in Madagascar.
Judging from reactions of Twitter users around the world, the fact that Gibson guitars were implicated provoked more reactions that the potential loss of the ring-tail lemur habitat.
The issue of deforestation in Madagascar is unfortunately not limited to rosewood trafficking.
Slash and burn agriculture has caused much of the anthropogenic deforestation of the region.
The NGO Vakanala has produced a remarkable 3D real time visualization of the numbers of bush fires affecting Madagascar:

Similarily, the Malagasy NGO Mistinjo has also focused its effort on capacity building of local communities that work towards forest restoration and carbon sequestration in Andasibe.
Local bloggers have been raising awareness over the loss of the national rain forest for a long time ago now.
But they do more than just raising awareness, Patrick, a blogger from Tamatave, has been steadily replanting trees in the Toamasina region and involved many other associations in this process:
Many Egyptian bloggers and activists have been detained by State Security on various occasions and for various reasons - real or fake - Wa7da Masreya interviewed several bloggers and posted a detailed post on torture techniques and psychological tricks those bloggers have been subjected to in State Security headquarters in the district of Nasr City. In her post, Wa7da Masreya wrote describing the headquarters:
e) In the same vulnerable position above, he would lay down on a wired wet blanket.
This past weekend, Moroccans celebrated Eid Al-Adha, or the Festival of the Sacrifice, often referred to in Morocco as Eid Al-Kabir, or "the big festival," as opposed to Eid al-Fitr, known colloquially as Eid al-Sghir, or "the little festival."
While the holiday shares the same meaning and traditions across the Muslim world, the celebrations are often uniquely local.
Bloggers in rural Morocco (referred to locally as the bled) are sharing their stories about this year's Eid.
As Internet access is sparse and often prohibitively expensive outside of cities, many of the people blogging from rural areas are Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) and are therefore positioned to give an outsiders' perspective...from the inside.
Erin, a PCV who blogs at Reflections and Experiences in Al Maghreb Al Aqsa, explains her host family's Eid traditions, saying:
Saturday morning, my host family slaughtered a sheep and 2 goats for the Eid celebration.
This is done in honor of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his son for God, before God told him to sacrifice a sheep instead.
Although Muslim families all over the world practice this tradition, people celebrate in very different ways.
Some families give all the meat to those in need, while some (like my host family) eat every last organ, and have enough meat to last them for 2 or more months.
Joy in Morocco, who is also a PCV, writes of something she's grateful for in Morocco, also sharing a picture of a woman
Joy in Morocco posted this photo on her blog from her village cooking on Eid:
Moroccan's close connection with food.
Sheep meat doesn't arrive in frozen packages.
They slaughter it.
They prepare all the meat- start to grill.
Similarly is their relationship with fruit and vegetables, particularly in my region.
Everything comes from their backyard, literally.
PCV oclynn in morocco was less of a fan of the holiday.
The blogger explains:
Smoke off the grills rising from all the rooftop decks as the heads and hooves of the sheep are first to go on the fire.
Listening to the thrashing of my neighbor’s sheep on our roof as it is dying (and why does it seem to be taking so long?).
Sheep were slaughtered on rooftops, the lot next door and on the sidewalk in front of homes.
Everywhere.
Blood running down the gutter.
It must be L’eid Kbir.
Not my favorite holiday, but the holiest of them all in the Muslim world.
Blowing up the lungs of the Eid sheep
Yet another PCV whose blog is called From the Cold Land with the Hot Sun shares an interesting experience from the holiday, complete with photo:
Though I'd like to divert the focus away from the gruesome and entertaining aspects of the celebration in favor of the more wholesome and boring ones, I did witness a jaw-dropping moment during the disemboweling of the animal that I cannot resist writing about here.
Upon removing the lungs from the inverted and dangling sheep's chest cavity, the friendly man spattered in blood held them up by the still-attached esophagus for all to see.
He then blew forcefully into the esophageal opening, causing the lungs to inflate fully- pink, glistening, and strange in the morning sun.
It was so cool.
Cynthia, the blogger behind The Couscous Chronicles, is another PCV writing about the holiday.
She explains why it's best to have "family" in Morocco:
This year was worlds better than last year simply because I chose to celebrate it with my neighbors (who have really become my family here) and their entire extended family, which is a hilarious and wonderful group of people.
Last year I felt like I just got shuffled around from house to house, drinking tea and eating meat and feeling awkward the whole time, but this year I felt like part of the celebration.
Feeling like a real part of a family makes holidays a lot more fun.
Last but not least, Reading Morocco shares a slideshow of photos from a Berber village in Southern Morocco, attributed to Leila Alaoui:

On Monday, December 14th, Blogger Bashir Hazzam and Internet cafe owner Abdullah Boukhou were sentenced to four months and one year, respectively plus a fine of MAD 500 (USD 63) each, in a Goulmim court.
Hazzam was sentenced for “spreading false information harmful to the kingdom's image on human rights,” while Boukhou's sentence was for similar reasons and likely included a charge for providing a space for spreading those information.
Three other students have been sentenced to six months and given a fine of MAD 5000 (USD 632) along with Bashir and Abdullah for an un-authorized sit-in in the city of Taghjijt.
Bashir Hazzam has been accused of “spreading false information harmful to the kingdom's image on human rights” after being arrested on December 8th, reported the Committee to Protect Bloggers, stating:
Moroccan blogger Bashir Hazem was arrested on December 8, 2009 following a protest in Tarjijt, during which students clashed with security forces, after posting a press release about the clash on his blog. He has been interrogated about his blogging, specifically his most recent post, which contained the signatures of a committee of arrested students.
ANHRI, The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, denounced the arrest of the blogger Bashir Hazzam.
Reporters without Borders (RSF) denounced and questioned why the sentence was given at a time when the Moroccan government is putting in place a program to promote internet access, information society and digital economy:
There are 20 languages spoken in Mozambique, according to the government website, apart from the official Portuguese.
Carlos Serra wonders if there are more, according to two renowned linguists: "One told me that there were between 20 and 26; the other told me that there were 17 written and some yet to be spelled out".
Not many know her as Mwanaisha Abdalla but Nyota Ndogo (Kiswahili for Small Star), is a household name in East Africa.
An artwork of her Nyota Ndogo's Cover Album - MpenziShe has been collecting fans of her eclectic East African sound for over 4 years now.
Her blog on the other hand has been running for 3 years.
There is no doubt that the blog has contributed the growth of her online fan base.
Born in 1981 in the Kenyan Coastal province of Mombasa, Nyota Ndogo has come from a very humble background.
She dropped out of school at a young age and for quite some time, worked as a house help until she was discovered by Andrew Burchell as a talented singer.
Now she has 3 cd's released under her name, CHEREKO, NATOKA MBALI NA WEWE and MPENZI.
She has also featured on 3 international compilations WORLD 2003, THE ROUGH GUIDE TO KENYA and OFF THE BEATEN TRACK.
She is also holder of two Kenya Kisima Music Awards: Best Taraab Singer 2003 and Best Female Singer 2005.
Her songs which are mostly in Kiswahili with a few in English are sang in the Taarab genre heard mostly in the East African Coast as well as in Kapuka and Genge, music genres heard mainly within the Kenyan mainland.
So how does one with such a background learn to harness the internet to her advantage as a growing Kenyan based Artist?
This is the question that comes to mind when you visit her blog.
In it, she shares everything about herself as an artist from a personal perspective as opposed to the edited media stories and information that one will find in the entertainment section of a newspaper or magazine.
From music videos of her songs to lyrics to photos of her performing with fellow artists and fans, one can feel a more intimate connection with Nyota Ndogo through her blog.
Blogging has not been an easy experience for her as she confessed in her blog post on 27th July, 2006 at 1.43pm
wow I’d nearly given up with the blog as it was proving difficult to get a new post up .it turned out to be me using an incompatible browser.
So am back with good old internet explorer.
If this works expect some pix up soon so much has happend.x
Looking at her current blog posts, one can indeed see that Nyota has known quite well how to use the blogging tool.
This unfortunately cannot be said of many other East African Artists as I could not find any other artist blog.
It seems, one need not be learned to know how to blog, it is after all, a tool.
Namibia's presidential and national assembly elections took place on 27–28 November 2009.
Fourteen political parties participated in the elections.
The ruling party, the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) is expected to win.
Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) is SWAPO's main challenger.
Political parties and non-governmental organisations used a number of social media tools to campaign, monitor and report on Namibia Elections 2009.
The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) used Ushahidi to monitor the elections.
Ushahidi, which means testimony in Kiswahili, was a tool created in the aftermath of disputed Kenya's elections in 2007.
Ushahidi collected eyewitness reports of violence placed them on a map.
NSHR used Ushahidi to collect reports about fraud, undue influence, intimidation, violence, etc.
Reports were sent in three ways: SMS, email and filling a form on the website.
Pre-election violence reported on Ushahidi:
Last Friday evening between 20hoo and 21hoo in Eveline Street in the Goreangab suburb of Windhoek, fighting started between a group of 15 Swapo party and 7 RDP supporters after the former singing 'We are Nujoma's soldiers' removed a RDP poster from a municipal light pole.
Members of the Wanaheda Police precinct rapidly intervened and no further incident occured that evening.
The African Elections Project uses new media to monitor and report on elections in African countries.
The project set up a Namibia page, a blog and Twitter page to keep track of elections news and results.
From African Elections Twitter page:
This is day 3 of verification process, The Electoral Commission has received 40% of results and 30% have been verified #namibiaelections2009

Election Watch is a project of the Institute for Public Policy Research.
Election Watch has a blog of live election results.
Claims of irregularities:
The RDP and several other opposition parties held a press conference on Saturday afternoon alleging a string of irregularities including indelible ink that didn't work, ballot papers that did not have the official stamp, and the ever-changing voters register (of which there is a new version with yet another figure for the number of registered voters).
The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) also used social networks such as Facebook to allow people from all over the world to express their views and opinions about Namibian elections.
Social media has not become popular in Namibia as in other African countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania.
We will keep our eyes on Namibia to see the future of social media in the country.
Leading up to the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP15) in December 2009, here is a sample of online tools to monitor climate change.
Using these tools, ordinary people can learn more about the effects, and help push decision makers to deal with solutions.
In the field
Tracking climate change impacts generally starts in the field.
James Balog, a photographer, has been to Alaska, USA, to record time-lapse ice cap melting.
You can see the stunning results of his photography in this video:
If you don't have expensive cameras and spare-time to journey to Alaska, another approach would be to read the experiences of people on the frontline.
On the Frontline of the Climate Change is a project cataloging first-hand stories on the impacts of climate change, in indigenous communities, on small islands, and other vulnerable communities.
The forums contains numerous recent contributions by email, mostly from South Asia and Africa.
One contributor and consultant for African development, George Katunguka, writes from Uganda:
The impact of climate change has not received much prominence in my country Uganda but such changes and its effects are painfully being felt.
In 2025, Uganda is likely to experience water stress according to recent report on water resources.
People are dying of starvation and hunger like the recent case in Teso Region, Eastern Uganda; there are changes in water ecosystems like the dwindling levels of Lake Victoria; unpredictable seasons, loss of soil fertility and loss of agricultural output and hence increased household poverty and its implications.
What are we doing to avert this looming catastrophe?

Observation from the field can be double-checked from high ground.
Space is the lookout from which to observe and analyze earth as a whole.
It's difficult to get a seat on a spaceship, but fortunately, it's easy to find online satellite images from above.
Satellite pictures of Aral Sea, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 1973/2004
Besides space agencies and companies offering their services to NGOs, scientists and common people, the United Nations Environment Programme created an online atlas indexing the changes occurring in different parts of the world through decades.
All the satellite pictures can be viewed on Google Earth's virtual globe, as their official blog reports:
In collaboration with the Danish government and others, we are launching a series of Google Earth layers and tours to allow you to explore the potential impacts of climate change on our planet and the solutions for managing it.
Many more resources can be found on blogs and websites of international organisations.

Science for decision makers
Observation is a core issue for decision makers.
Governments initiate surveys to understand the phenomenon and how to mitigate the impacts.
The European Commission and European Space Agency initiated a space program in 1998, called the Global Monitoring Environmental Security (GMES), to sketch real-time changes from multi-source data.
The project is due to report back in 2014, with an annexed security segment.
Developing countries impacted most directly by climate change, have taken a similar steps like the recent satellites launch by India to study climate change.
Such information can help countries plan for new environmental and economic policies.
In South Africa, a new economy-oriented tool has been created for exactly this purpose.
AllAfrica reports :
Now, an analytical tool based on a study, Mapping South African Farming Sector Vulnerability to Climate Change and Variability, has been developed to help policy-planners identify the communities most vulnerable to climate change and help them prepare for radically different farming conditions.
On the 31 December, the Gaza Freedom March is taking place to mark a year passing since Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli attack on Gaza.
The International Coalition to End the Illegal Siege of Gaza is mobilising an international contingent to march alongside the people of Gaza, in a non-violent show of solidarity and with the hope of ending the Gaza blockade.
Many of the participants have already arrived in Cairo in preparation.
The Freedom March has the participation of many noteworthy people, including author Alice Walker, Syrian actor and director Duraid Lahham, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, and French rap group MAP, amongst others.
Amongst the participants is 84-year old Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstien.
Hedy Epstein has been actively raising awareness about the march.
On 01 Dec 2009, along with J’Ann Allen, the wife of a retired military officer and Sandra Mansour, a Palestinian refugee, she issued a public invitation to political activist, Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to go to Gaza with them. Wiesel was urged to “Break Your Silence and Come With Us”, during a speech at St.Louis University:
Hedy Epsteins participation in the March has been met with much appreciaton:
Desertpeace applauds her participation:
Seeing a survivor of those horrors struggle against today’s evils is truly an inspiration.
I am speaking of Hedy Epstein, who as I write this, is on her way to Gaza to take part in the Gaza Freedom March.
This is what the Holocaust should have ‘produced’ as an ‘industry’, an industry that does not allow a repetition of the past….
NEVER AGAIN!
The organisation of the march has not, however, been without its hurdles, and organisers the International Coalition to End the Illegal Siege of Gaza, have not been beyond criticism.
Norman Finkelstein, author of The Holocaust Industry and 'dreamer' of the march, was initially an active member of the coalition, but has since resigned.
His frustration came from a much-debated change in the statement of the coalition.
The original statement of the coalition was to march to break the siege in accordance with the principle of non-violence and anchored in international law.
The statement was later amended to include the ‘political context,’ which Finkelstein deemed divisive as it brought in potentially contentious issues unnecessary to the original appeal.
While he does not specify the exact amendments with which he objects, he comments in his address Why I resigned from the Gaza Freedom March coalition:
It should perhaps be stressed that the point of dispute was not whether one personally supported a particular Palestinian right or strategy to end the occupation.
It was whether inclusion in the coalition’s statement of a particular right or strategy was necessary if it was both unrelated to the immediate objective of breaking the siege and dimmed the prospect of a truly mass demonstration.
His high-profile departure was accompanied by the withdrawal of a number of other active members.
Max at Jewbonics noted his departure from the movement with regret.
As an organiser of the march he responded to fears that others would leave the movement, reporting:
I think it is safe to say that number lost will be dwarfed by the number gained, if what I've seen in-person and on-line has been any indication
Despite concerns over the numbers endorsing the march, this is indeed a mass demonstration, and is the first time that Palestinians will be coming together in such large numbers along with international support: there are an estimated 1,300 international participants participating, who will meet in Cairo and march alongside a predicated 50,000 local residents once they have crossed into Gaza through Rafah.
At the Electronic Intifada, Rami Almeghari reports that:
In recent months, people in Gaza believe the international community began to direct its attention elsewhere, neglecting the siege of Gaza.
Few international media outlets pay attention to the situation here.
The march hopes to change this.
Mustafa al-Kayali, coordinator of the steering committee for the Gaza Freedom March, reports:
We call on the internationals who come here not to consider their visits as tourism.
Rather, they should convey a real message from the ground to their peoples, organizations or governments...
Most of local youth with whom I talked over the Gaza Freedom March expressed excitement and enthusiasm for participation.
They are keen to send a message to the outside world that the Palestinian people are there and that humans should be united for the sake of freedom.

Today, readers of leading Polish blogs might have been surprised to see a new welcome screen on one of their favourite websites: it announced that, beginning Dec.
14, 2009, access to this blog was no longer free of charge.
The new intro gave readers three options: 5 PLN + VAT for 7-day access (approx.
1.25 EUR) 9 PLN + VAT for full-month access (approx.
2.1 EUR) leave the website
The whole thing, which is one big surprise for Polish users, is almost solved after readers make up their minds and make their decision known by clicking on either of the three buttons.
A second screen appears then, thanking readers for... taking part in a special survey, and promising to post the results shortly.
Rumour is that interactive agency Autentika is behind this.
But many people decided to leave the website before making any click, which led to negative comments on Polish microblogging websites such as Blip.
Despite the probable commercial aspect behind all of this, it's the first time when one institution managed to unite for action so many important and well-read bloggers (we have counted six of them).
Global Voices will monitor this interesting commercial/advertising case and publish the results of the survey, too, as soon as they appear.
The youth and adult groups also had a music workshop, here is a snippet of it:
In Singapore, raping your wife is not treated as rape.
But it should be.
This is the main message of the ‘No To Rape' campaign published in the Facebook page of the group.
The organizers aim to abolish the marital rape immunity law in Singapore.
The ‘No To Rape’ campaign advocates one simple idea: sexual violence by any person, against any person, is criminal violence.
Consequently, non-consensual sexual penetration, regardless of whether the victim and perpetrator are married to each other, should be treated as rape
The group has already gathered more than 3,000 signatures for the petition which will be delivered to the Prime Minister
We would like to thank everyone who has given his or her support to the No To Rape petition to abolish marital rape immunity in Singapore.
Twenty minutes ago, our petition has officially come to a close with over 3,600 signatures.
Over the next few days, we will be putting together the data collected before presenting it to our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, by email and in hard copy.
Barnyard Chorus observes that “Rape culture in Singapore is a phenomenon that has really caught us by surprise and disturbed us when it finally reared its unabashedly ugly, misogynistic andabhorrent head.”
Syinc is supportive of the ‘No to Rape’ campaign
Let's just look at one facet of how maddeningly awful this is.
When a strange man rapes a stranger, it's highly unlikely that they'll ever have to face each otehr again.
When a husband rapes a wife, they'll be seeing each other everyday.
In fact, the abuse is more than likely to keep going on.
Perhaps, everyday.
When someone who promised to love and protect you through thick and thin commits such a horrific act - this leaves indelible scars deep within a person's psyche.
The Temasek Review explains why the cause involves everyone
This campaign brings together women and men, the young and the old, people from different races, believers in various faiths and those of no faith at all.
Whatever your background, all of us have a shared interest in this.
Everyone deserves the protection of the law from violence, no matter who commits it.
Rape is a beating, a form of abuse, that just happens to be carried out using a sexual organ instead of a fist.
The ‘No To Rape’ campaign has produced several ads urging Singaporeans to support the petition drive
Bu some netizens are not supportive of the campaign.
Toolang comments at The Online Citizen blog
The poor response shows that if every couple supports the campaign to make marital rape into law, the Police would be kept very busy throughout the year and have no time to keep Singapore safe and secure from crimes and terrorism except to investigate what thousands of couple do every night on bed, to assess whether excessive force was used on the partner.
If excessive force was indeed used and tantamount to marital rape, the Police may take months to investigate.
In the meantime, the couple reconciles and settles another round of pleasure on bed to resolve the dispute and do not want to pursue further.
All the Police efforts go down the drain.
I would suggest the researchers go down to the High and Family Courts and understand the family and domestic problems thoroughly first before embarking on this campaign.
Btan believes the organizers failed to gather enough signatures because it lacks genuine public support
Petitioners are still in denial.
The lack of signature is not because of lack of publicity or drive but because most people know this petition is silly and nonsensical.
The petitioners insult the people, especially women, by assuming they cannot take care of themselves when they have the full weight of the law behind them.
It is better they direct their energies to more worthy cause, like establishing a genuine two-party system in Singapore where our citizens are not whipped like slaves and foreigners entering en mass diluting our national spirit.
The house is burning and they are worrying about a bad hair day?
Get your priorities right.
The ‘No To Rape” campaign also has a Twitter account.
Samak Sundaravej — former Bangkok Governor, cooking show host, and Thailand's 25th Prime Minister passed away last November 24.
Samak was a controversial political figure who was legally removed from the top post last year when the Court ruled that he violated the law for hosting a cooking TV show while holding a public position.
Bangkok Pundit highlights the obituaries published by major newspapers.
Thaizer describes Samak as a keen chef who popularized Thai food:
A keen chef, Samak’s passion for Thai food made him a regular at the fresh food markets of Bangkok and his gruff, no-nonsense approach made him a popular host of a cookery show on Thai television.
Ironically, it was the television show which would eventually see him ousted from the position of prime minister.
Samak is fondly remembered as a true culinary enthusiast
After his election victory the first thing he did was invite reporters from all over Thailand to his home to sample his homemade noodles.
Samak is a true culinary enthusiast, and we think he'll be a great contributor to the reputation and enjoyment of delicious Thai food all over the world.
A youtube video clip shows Samak’s well-attended funeral bathing rite:
Bangkok twitterers react to the news of Samak’s death
zaz_zy: RIP Khun Samak the cooking world will miss u.
Truth Be Told ... That is absolutely right.
TAN_Network: Red shirt supporters to protest against presence of Democrat MP's at Samak's funeral
Tongteng: @suthichai Although I aint like Khun Samak, I would say that I'm quite perplexed seeing many negative comments 'bout him online today.
RIP.
praditpi: Samak Sundaravej, 25th prime minister of Thailand, passed away today.
With all his goodness, I wish him rest in peace
anirutpichedpan: Death of K Samak proves many people forget the good notion of 4giveness in its entirety!Only hate remains!Forget about conciliation,I say
wisekwai: RIP Samak.
Thai politics has lost a bit of color.
ChadapornLin: it's sad upon Samak's death that I try to think of good things to remember him by out of courtesy but I just can't
During a royally-sponsored funeral rite, the anti-government Red Shirts (most of them were Samak supporters) outside the temple booed government officials who attended the ritual.
Samak had many critics.
After his death, some bloggers have chosen to highlight his negative legacy.
Harrison George points out the anti-democratic record of Samak
Samak has established the right of all Thai political leaders to spend a career justifying murder, jailing opponents, shutting down the media and foul-mouthing anyone with the temerity to question them, and still be described, as his successor as PM Somchai described him, as ‘devoting his life to democracy’.
Bangkok Dazed describes Samak as a “creepy political character”
He may have been colorful but he was also a nasty character who embodied the worst traits of Thai politics.
I only wish he would take a few hundred other current politicians to the grave with him.
Political Prisoners in Thailand writes that Samak is a political dinosaur:
Samak was one of Thailand’s old guard who was able to stay on the scene and politically relevant because many basic features of Thai politics remained unchanged.
In other words, because the political environment changed relatively slowly, the political dinosaurs have been able to adapt and even thrive
Tunisian student Mohamed Soudani, 24, disappeared on October 22, 2009, in Tunisia after giving interviews to Radio Monte Carlo International and Radio France International.
Soudani was missing for 18 days until Tunisia’s police contacted his family inform them that he is detained in the Murnaguiya prison about 15km away from the capital Tunis.
According to sources, the police also informed Soudani’s family that he was put on trial and convicted for “disorderly conduct” during his detention without legal counsel and was sentenced to four months in prison.
They also learned that he had since appealed his sentence.
During his court appearance on December 6, Soudani denied the charges filed against him and stated that he was tortured aggressively during his extrajudicial detention.
His lawyers asked for a recess to study the case and his release on bail.
The release request was denied while his trial was adjourned to December 14, 2009.
Soudani was interviewed about his past activities as a student leader in the General Union of the Students of Tunisia.
He was involved last year in a 56-day hunger strike with another four students demanding their right to go back to school.
They have also blogged about their hunger strike experience day by day on a blog which had been censored in Tunisia.
A Facebook group and a blog have been created to support Mohamed Soudani in the hardships he is experiencing.

The second day of the Arab Bloggers Workshop kicked off with a presentation about Herdict Web, a site which uses crowdsourcing to gather reports of Internet filtering from users around the world.
Qatari workshop participant Muhammad Basheer tweeted a photo from the presentation:

Following the first presentation, Egyptian blogger Manal discussed the world of Arab techies, particularly touching about female techies in Egypt.
Lebanese NightS noted the need for more women at #ab09:

After Manal's informative presentation, the bloggers broke into group workshops, touching on a variety of subjects.
One workshop, conducted by hamzoz, focused on blogging from Iraq.
Muhammad Basheer attended the presentation and tweeted:

Bahraini participant Amira Al Hussaini attended a presentation by the lead of the new Rising Voices project in Yemen.
She was clearly impressed by the workshop:
Amira Al Hussaini is impressed by the number of Yemeni bloggers
The last major presentation of the day was once again perhaps the most captivating.
Anas Tawileh, founder of Meedan, presented on the Arabic-English crowd translation project.
Iraqi blogger Salam Pax best captured the sentiment in this tweet:
Salam Pax was captivated by the Meedan presentation
Tawileh opened his presentation with a number of interesting facts about the Internet including one that the number of hours spent on Facebook in a year, translated into volunteer hours, could be spent to build the Giza pyramids in only 9 days.
Amira Al Hussaini shared another of Tawileh's tidbits:
Amira Al Hussaini tweets a fun fact
Tweeting about the concept, Moroccan GV author Hisham G. summed up Meedan in a few words:
Lastly, Meedan itself (which has covered the workshop here) noted on Twitter that they'll be translating tweets from the conference (which can otherwise be found on hashtag #ab09):
Meedan will be translating tweets from the workshop
Uganda's proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009 still awaits a final decision by the country's Parliament, but the country's Daily Monitor newspaper reported Wednesday that President Yoweri Museveni has "assured the US State Department of his willingness to block the Bill":
President Museveni has reportedly assured American authorities that he will veto Ndorwa West MP David Bahati’s proposed anti-gay law, a position that breaks with his recent stance and the statements of officials in his government.
Activists gathered outside the Ugandan Mission to the United Nations in New York City in November to protest the bill. Photo courtesy of riekhavoc on Flickr.
Blogger Gay Uganda points out the contradictions in the Ugandan government's messages to the West and to Ugandans themselves:
Government’s anti-gay stand stays, says minister
In a statement issued yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa said the government does not support the promotion of homosexuality “just like we cannot promote prostitution.”
AfroGay speculates that the Ugandan government believed it could get away with the bill because world leaders have other things on their minds:
As in 1999 when Museveni himself ordered that gays be arrested and jailed in what was clearly an ill-thought-out throwaway , MU7 thought that the Bahati bill would be a side issue in these times when Obama is engrossed with the Taliban, Gordon Brown is a lame duck and there is no one else taking Africa that seriously apart from the barracuda-like Chinese.
But the truth is that Obama and Europe are happy to take Uganda on because it is an easy target compared to, say, China.
Hillary Clinton said it the other day that you don't handle China the way you do a third world country and that was her way of indicating indirectly where exactly she puts Uganda in the pecking order.
In another post, AfroGay discusses what might be happening behind the scenes:
So, even if they are now being deliberately vague about it, the government has a view about the bill.
And their view is that it is terrible for their international standing and funding.
The convulsions are not over yet.
Bahati has been emboldened by the attention he has received, and he is clearly reveling in his fifteen minutes of fame.
So, he will likely not acquiesce easily.
But twist his arm the government is going to.
Look out for a new clinic in Bahati’s constituency, promises of this and that to the people of Ndorwa and he might even be promised direct funding of his campaign for reelection.
What Museveni wants in Uganda, Museveni gets and I predict that the bill will be a shadow of its former self by the time it reaches the floor of Parliament – if it ever gets there.
Russian authorities continue to investigate the crash of the train "Nevsky Express" that happened between Moscow and St. Petersburg on Friday night.
According to officials, the tragedy that took lives of at least 25 passengers was a terrorist attack.
The crash raised a number of questions.
Many people ask what happened during the first hours after the crash and why it took so long to start reporting on it.
Since the tragedy happened far from any major populated area, it took several hours for reporters to arrive on the spot.
Only then the first photographs and videos started to appear everywhere.
But what happened to social media platforms that actively reported on the plane crash in Perm in September 2008?
The only passenger who immediately reported about the crash of "Nevsky Express" was a Twitter user Lazy Frog.
She tweeted 12 times about the crash before she arrived home.
Here is what she wrote:
I am alive.
But I should tell about it later.
If someone tells anything in news, please write me.
They don't tell us anything here.
Later, many passengers from first cars - only last cars were derailed - said they were clueless for the whole hour after the crash.
Lazy Frog posted few additional updates:
We boarded another train.
I did whatever I could to help.
We are now at SAPSAN (new train that evacuated passengers to St. Petersburg - G.A.).
I wish it would go slower.
They announced now that specially trained people would meet us at the train station.
The day after the tragedy, Lazy Frog summarized her experience:
I felt the first emotions about what happened when we got closer to Piter (St. Petersburg - G.A.).
I wasn't worried at the place of the crash.
I was a little concerned about my shoes - it was so muddy around and sharp stones.
Saturday revealed more first-hand information when passengers started blogging about their experiences.
The most popular blog post related to the topic was written by LJ user paltus_mk who was in one of the last cars heavily damaged by an explosion.
He wrote :
All that happens within 10 seconds when you understand what is about to occur.
I had enough time to prepare my body.
But nothing can help against the Newton's laws when dozens of tons of metal suddenly stop at high speed - just luck ... ...therefore I was just lucky.
My brother was lucky, too, despite the fact that his wounds were more serious than mine.
Everything from something that went wrong till the full stop took about 30 seconds.
It was dark and silent.
Then wounded people started to cry.
I was on the floor, smashed by other bodies.
I moved the bodies.
I saw that I was covered with blood but it wasn't mine.
I saw that I am ok and my hand\legs work.
I had a bleeding wound in my head.
I had to get up and waited for some time before men with less serious injuries cleaned the way out.
Suffering was all around.
We were sitting at the end of the train car and all the bags flied toward us.
A lot of wounded people around.
Durng the first minutes after the crash, the car was just a buch of bodies, chairs and parts of the train that were equally distributed around.
Paltus_mk tells the story of evacuation from the first minutes after the crash with many details but, at the same time, avoids description that may disturb readers.
He writes that passengers started providing the first aid to each other heroically and without panic.
He says it was impossible to count how many people died.
The rescuers arrived only an hour and a half after the crash.
Paltus_mk and his brother were finally evacuated to a local hospital and he later arrived to St. Petersburg.
Another survival story was published by a blogger pancakyes on another Russian blogging service Ya.ru . Her train car was not damaged by the explosion.
She published her first post at 22:11 - a half an hour after the crash - right from the place of the tragedy.
She wrote that the train stopped because of some accident, few cars were derailed and she would come home later than expected.
Almost an hour later, she added that there were victims in the last two cars.
On Saturday, pancakyes published the whole story of the crash as she witnessed it:
We felt few shakes that were getting stronger and stronger.
Things started to fall down from the table.
It was not clear what happened.
No announcements.
First, we were thinking that it wasn't serious.
Maybe someone stopped the train by accident.
But conductors with pale faces started running around collecting mattresses, tablecloths and water.
They asked us not to leave our seats unless we are doctors.
We heard some bad things from their radios.
Some rumors started to go around.
We didn't believe that two cars were disconnected and they were so far.
Later, we fund out that it was true.
We went out and wanted to help. Went up untill the third car.
We didn't want to be just gawkers and make a crowd without any opportunity to help.
We also didn't want to see what people who came from there told us.
Immediately after the crash, social media platforms became the first place where Russian journalist were looking for information.
A reporter from a Russian news agency RIA-Novosty left a comment on the pancakyes' blog and asked her to call him immediately.
Tatyana Landa (LJ user Elada) wrote on her blog about a friend who was on the train but survived.
Two reporters immediately left comments asking her to contact them.
Tatyana later published an angry post where she told that a journalist from "Komsomolskaya pravda" (Russian tabloid newspaper) was trying to call her several times during that night.
The post turned to a place were people started to discuss if journalists can use bloggers as sources of information about the train crash.
Reporters also tried to contact a blogger who wrote that she had decided not to take the "Nevsky Express" at the last minute.
Some bloggers expressed their frustration with the fact that so few people from the train used social media to report about what was happening. And, apparently, there are several explanations why social media didn't play major role in the coverage of the "Nevsky express" tragedy.
Twitter, the most convenient platform for live blogging, is relatively unpopular in Russia.
According to twitRU , there are only 2,700 Twitter users who write in Russian language.
At the same time, popular Russian blogging platforms as Livejournal.com or ya.ru could have been used for live reporting but, as discussed above, there is only a couple of examples of this use.
The second explanation is related to the role of mobile devices and connectivity.
The number of portable devices in the country is growing.
More and more Russians can use Internet and various Web-applications on the go.
This trend is especially strong in the area of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
But the crash happened far from any metropolitan area where, as witnesses reported, the cell phone coverage was limited.
A blogger pancakyes recollects the connectivity problem:
The phone connection was very bad.
Everyone probably tried to make a call at the same time and the net was overloaded.
I started to get SMSs only when I was on the second train (the one that took passengers to Saint-Petersburg - G.A.).
I could use the Internet occasionally, but it was very difficult.
In contrast, the plane crash in Perm last year provided many opportunities for citizen reporting:
1
The plane crashed within the city borders where many people could see what happened right from their windows.
The "Nevsky express" crash, as noted earlier, happened the rural area. 2.
The social media coverage in Perm was based on the accounts of those who witnessed the crash but were not part of it (unfortunately, there were no survivors on the plane).
All the witnesses of the "Nevsky Express" incident were passengers on the train.
3
Most people posted their updates on the plane crash in Perm using their home computers.
The "Nevsky Express" survivors had to rely on their mobile devices.
These differences explain why social media reporting was prevalent in the case of the plane crash and almost absent in the situation with "Nevsky Express."
It is also possible to claim that Russia has not yet developed the tradition of social media reporting.
That is why only two passengers were motivated enough to go online and assume the role of citizen reporters.
It may also explain the hostility of passengers and bloggers toward journalists who were looking for information on the crash in social media.
It looks like the Russian blogosphere is still far from being a major source for breaking news.
It still remains as a place for distribution of information and broad discussions about what has happened.
Russian photojournalist Oleg Klimov has recently spent two hours waiting for a train at the train station in Syzran, a city in Russia's Samara region.
While there, he interacted with a few locals and then jotted down their stories of extreme poverty (RUS) on his blog.
Story #1:
Mother, her daughter, and grandson, aged 5 or so.
Have been living at the train station for two days.
Are 400 rubles (approx. $13) short of to get to their native village, not far from .
Are coming back from a funeral.
Are waiting for a female relative to arrive and bring those 400 rubles.
The relative isn't coming - possibly, because she is out of money, too.
They asked to send a text message .
Ordinary village people.
Maybe they aren't too clever and aren't too educated, but they are open-minded and ingenuous.
Qualities of no small value nowadays.
The mother's pension is 4,500 rubles .
The daughter sometimes works in Penza, and sometimes doesn't.
The son doesn't attend a kindergarten. there is no kindergarten.
A female relative had died, they gathered all the money they had and set off to bury her.
"How else? - One has to bid a decent human farewell..."
Story #2:
Four ethnic Tatar women commute weekly from their village to Syzran to earn some money.
At best, they make a thousand between the four of them, working as cleaning ladies at public facilities and anywhere else.
There is no work whatsoever in the village.
"There is work, but none of it pays."
Sometimes they don't have enough money to simply buy bread.
So they buy flour and bake their own bread.
To save money.
They have their own potatoes.
And cucumbers, and cabbage.
But they don't have money.
"It's possible to survive, but very difficult.
It's easier to die..."
Story #3:
A man, aged 55 or a little older. His children threw him out of his home.
Just like that: "Get the hell out of here... Sometimes I stay with my acquaintances, and sometimes at the train station.
Do random jobs, here and there..." Doesn't consider himself a hobo, because "there are no hobos in a small town.
People do help."
He's got cold tea in a plastic bottle.
Bread and foul-smelling cutlets are wrapped in some piece of rag. He ate one cutlet with bread.
Washed it down with tea and fell asleep on the train station bench right after that.
Just lowered his head onto his chest and fell asleep.
Klimov ends his post on an emotional note, writing that "it's horrible to watch all this," and that there is no shortage of such stories in the "sleek-looking 'Putin's Russia'":
You can spend a couple more hours there and write a piece.
With no comments.
Just by listening and writing down things that people say to each other.
It's that simple.
Any journalist can do this.
And no damn intellectual analysis is required.

As more Africans come to realize the power of blogging as a tool for expression on a global scale, the number of bloggers has increased and so has the themes in focus.
In that number of growing blogs, a lot of African artists have also joined in with a huge increase noted in poetry blogs as well as emerging photography and visual arts blogs.
We review some of them.
Poéfrika is a weblog of creative, Africa-inspired writing.
The blog features poetry by various African poets, interviews with poets, writers as well news and information on world renowned poets and writers alike.
The blog also has a lot of resource material for would be poet as it lists links to various poetry publishing magazines, writers who have been featured in the blog and other links of interest to writers including their potrait photos.
Poéfrika is run by Rethabile Masilo a Lesotho citizen but currently based in France.
He also runs Canopic Jar and Basotho which also feature written and visual art.

The slogan for his blog is
“Intense thoughts like active beings, come and go Haunt us then flee, leaving ajar the door.”
This is what he says about himself
....I my words forgot, and thoughts my wrote; I'm weeping laughter, Humming thoughts and writing beats, Walking thoughts and thinking walks....
I would say that is a poetic piece right there.
Hi poetry is short and precise with most not exceeding 10 lines.
The themes range from love to politics to his challenges as a poet.
An excerpt from his poem – Will you still be mine
Will you still be mine in the morning
After the evening passion fades
After all the pleasures of last night
have all been swept away
Will you still be mine
After the bitter arguments and fighting
After harsh words have been exchanged
will you open your arms and let me back in

Merlin is a Campus student born in 87.
He describes himself on his blog, iceboxmerlin.
got a swag to walk the talk, talk the walk sometimes, but always a down to earth and sensational individual to be around!’
You can tell from the image header that he is a great fan of animations.
He labels his blog, 'The Phanton Thought……..'
His disclaimer,
“Here are my thoughts on the world, life and the unraveling of the universe.
The symptom of an involved mind with the features of life, is the intelligence and later a harnessed genius.
It is the achieved Phantom thought of thick air!
His blog features a lot of poetry and prose in which he explores different issues and themes.
An excerpt of his poem, ‘The air is thick!...
Where the air is thick!
I have gone to a place,
like what a journey would be...
and had sweet thick mango juice,
A Kayamba playing in the back ground,
like that group of men call themselves Kayamba Africa
there was a man though,
a Rasta Man chewing at Muguka
green gobbler and something he's mumbling
between stuffing his mouth.
and puffing a cigarette,
the air here is unmistakably thick
so he says with a thick baritone voice,
"young man!",
"write us some of that scribble you call poetry..."
"am in a mood for anything"
and a thick air came about me,
to put some sense into him!
Boyd Oyier is a 4th year student at a university in Kenya.
He is also a self taught artist who loves to experiment and is currently working with charcoal and pastels.

His depictions of influential world faces on are superbly done with emotions that one can almost touch.
His blog is not more than a month old, something he started after attending a workshop on blogging and social networks in Nairobi.
He is currently putting together his first ever official collection that is titled “Politics in Black and White”
This is what he states as the purpose of art:
“The main function of art should be to connect to people.
Each of us appreciates art in one form or another, but we are turned off by the 'elite' who decided to complicate art by using labels such as 'surreal', 'new age' and 'contemporary'.
The best art is the art that you love!”
We look forward to seeing the collection online.
Tafsiri Hii is a Kenyan poet blogger who runs afropoem, a blog about a Black Woman’s Poem.
This is how she describes herself:
Her blog which is barely one year old confronts issues of trafficking of African Women for prostitution, love, culture and celebration of African Men among other themes,
These blogs are proof that there is more to Africa than politics as has been depicted by many African bloggers.
We can be sure of seeing more such blogs.
As the first day of the Second Annual Arab Bloggers Workshop comes to a close, we'll take a look at participants' reflections from the whole day, to find out what they learned and how they're feeling.
The day started off with a bang, as Global Voices organizers Sami Ben Gharbia, Amira Al Hussaini, and our sponsors from The Heinrich Böll Foundation welcomed participants from across the Arab world and beyond.
Following the introductions, presenters Noha Atef of Global Voices Advocacy and Eman Abdulrahman of Global Voices (and founder of Kolena Laila) shared their tips and thoughts on creating effective campaigns online.
Mauritanian attendee weddady noted that Kolena Laila is looking to build partnerships across the Arab world in this tweet:
You can find more information at kolenalaila.com
Throughout the day, there were several specialized workshops, on everything from circumvention and anonymity (presented by Jacob Applebaum) to citizen journalism (presented by Amira Al Hussaini and Salam Pax) to video-hosting alternatives to YouTube (presented by Slim Amamou and Marcin Gajewski).
Of the latter, Lina Ben Mhenni commented:
Some alternatives to YouTube
The presentation that got participants most riled up, however, was one given by Syrian attendee Razan Ghazzawi on the Berkman Center for Internet & Society's study mapping the Arabic blogosphere.
Though there were too many reactions to share (which can be found by searching the hashtag #ab09 on Twitter), here are some highlights: Egyptian participant lastoadri wondered on Twitter if participants were fully informed about the study:
lastoadri wonders aloud
Nasser Weddady noted an important point made by Razan:

Finally, Iraqi Salam Pax agreed with Razan on the issue, stating:

The murder of an Indian man in Melbourne has reignited the debate about racism in Australia and the safety of overseas students.
It has also severely strained relations between Australia and India:
INDIAN diplomats are expected to meet their Australian counterparts for crisis talks in Canberra today following the murder of an Indian migrant in Melbourne.
The murder of 21-year-old accounting graduate Nitin Garg in a Yarraville park on Saturday night was yesterday condemned by politicians in India and Australia.
Diplomatic crisis erupts after Indian student's murder
Australian bloggers’ responses show a very diverse range of views.
Gerard Henderson, Executive director of The Sydney Institute, speculates on the geopolitical undertones in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald :
The tragedy happened to coincide with a distinct cooling in the relationship between the two nations over the past couple of years.
During a visit to India in late 2008 I was surprised to hear strong criticism of Kevin Rudd at the highest levels of the New Delhi administration.
India's prime gripe turned on the refusal of the Rudd Government's to sell uranium to India, which overturned the intention of John Howard and his senior ministers.
Student assaults teach some harsh lessons about racism
Loon Pond, aka Dorothy Parker, takes Henderson to task:
Is it just me, or is it just grubbiness of an arcane kind to link the assault and murder of Indians in Australia to Australia's current policies in relation to the sale of uranium to India?
That's the convoluted tap dance performed by Gerard Henderson in Student assaults teach some harsh lessons about racism.
Gerard Henderson, India, uranium, street crime, and a particularly grubby column
Peter Maher blogs for Melbourne radio station 3AW. He is concerned that there is a culture of denial, whether or not the killing was racially motivated:
How anyone can say it is not race related when they do not know the circumstances of the murder as I said earlier is difficult to comprehend.
What I do know though is that this abusive, violent, murderous behaviour towards Indians in this country is far too prevalent to suggest that we do not have a problem with racism in this country.
… We are so quick to brush these racist tendencies under the carpet and provide the world with this image of us as being non-discriminatory and all-inviting.
I think it is time we took a real good look at ourselves and do something about the racism that exists in this country.
Wake up Australia!
We are racist
Dave, blogging as True Blue Aussie, has little doubt about the nature of any racism:
Of course everyone in Melbourne is aware, that Footscray, which used to be an Australian suburb, is now full of Islamic Sudanese, Middle Eastern Arabs and Somalians.
There is hardly an Australian to be seen in Footscray.
So, welcome to the divisive multicultural, ethnically diverse, immigration hell hole where immigrants (in this case likely be be muslims) attack other immigrants and Australians are blamed.
Dave Racist immigrants will be blamed for the fatal stabbing of an Indian man
A Facebook group, 1,000,000 True Aussies Against Racism, has a very different view of what it means to be an “Australian”.
Their aim is to: Stop the vocal minority who are using Facebook and talk back radio to make this wonderful country look like REDNECK nirvana.
Andrew Bartlett, former Democrats Senator and current Greens candidate for the next Federal election, wants more action from both State and Federal leaders.
Writing for Asian Correspondent he argues:
While every crime should be treated on its merits, and we should not automatically assume this latest crime was racially motivated, the history of past attacks, and arguably the slowness of Australian authorities to take the issue sufficiently seriously, means that just a single serious incident such as this has the Hindustan Times reporting that, "Indian government officials 'will be forced' to issue a (travel) advisory in the form of a warning to those who want to work and study Down Under, if the (Australian) authorities there did not take stern action this time."
It is the responsibility of government and community leaders to take effective steps to assure people that (a) the issue is being treated with maximum seriousness, and (b) everything reasonable is done to ensure peoples' safety.
When there is a plausible prospect that people are being targeted because of their race, it is essential that all is done to reduce the risks to them.
Tragic murder puts spotlight back on safety of Indians in Australia
Meanwhile the safety of athletes and visitors at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October is an ongoing issue that could erupt at any time.
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a High Degree of Caution as its current travel advice for India.
Tit for tat coming up perhaps?
UPDATE 6 January 2010
The Times of India reports that an advisory warning has been the result:
Succumbing to popular outrage over continuing attacks on Indian students in Australia, the government on Tuesday issued an advisory warning students heading to Australia for studies and those already there.
The foreign ministry cautioned students that incidents of violence had started affecting the larger Indian community in Australia.
The advisory came three days after accounting graduate Nitin Garg was knifed to death, the first fatality in the attacks.
It also came on a day when Indian and Australian officials met in Canberra to search for better ways to deal with the continuing violence even as the partially burnt body of another Indian was found.
Advisory asks students to be careful in Australia
As a result of the catastrophic 7.0 earthquake that hit the island country this evening (January 12), "Haiti" is currently a trending topic on Twitter.
Among the mass of retweets of mainstream media reports and tweets sending prayers and good wishes to the Caribbean island nation, have been eyewitness reports from musician and hotelier Richard Morse, who tweets as @RAMHaiti.
Morse posted his initial tweet around 6:00pm Haiti time, reporting that:
were ok at the oloffson ..internet is on !! no phones ! hope all are okay..alot of big building in PAP are down !
A series of tweets sent an hour later reported:
Just about all the lights are out in Port au Prince.. people still screaming but the noise is dying as darkness sets.
lot's of rumors about which buildings were toppled..The Castel Haiti behind the Oloffson is a pile of rubble..it was 8 stories high
Our guests are sitting out in the driveway.. no serious damage here at the Oloffson but many large buildings nearby have collapsed
I'm told that parts of the Palace have collapsed..the UNIBANK here on Rue Capois has collapsed people are bringing people by on stretchers
Port au Prince is dark except for a few fires
A huge hospital that was being built across from the Oloffson has collapsed cars are starting to circulate..I see lights in the distance towards the wharf
Later, Morse re-tweeted @isabelleMORSE, who reported " much destruction on Grand Rue (Ave Dessalines) Daniel Morel's ok.
Police Sta, Cathedral, Downtown teleco, Church St Anne all destroyed".
Just after 7:30pm Haiti time, Morse wrote that:
Phones are starting to work..got a call from some one who's house fell in, child is hurt but ok. .A few people showing up @ Oloffson..roads are blocked by falling walls..much destruction on Grand Rue.
I hear hospital General has collapsed people are needing medical supplies..food, housing; I don't know water situation;
Then, around 7:45pm:
another aftershock..people are screaming and freaking out down towards the stadium..much singing and praying in large numbers
And at around 8:40pm Haiti time:
another aftershock..a little longer..much screaming downtown..this is going to be a long night
Also proliferating on Twitter are citizen photos of the destruction such as the ones below, reportedly sent to Twitter user @marvinady by journalist Carel Pedre of Haiti's Radio One.
@LisandroSuero has also posted photos of the destruction, including the one below: Global Voices' Special Coverage Page on the earthquake in Haiti is here.
For many, the news that Bolivian President Evo Morales would name ex-Miss Bolivia Jessica Jordan, 25, as the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party candidate for governor of the Department of Bení seemed like a late Day of the Innocents (Bolivia's version of April Fools Day) joke.
However, when the announcement became official in a live televised press conference, the reaction became immediate on Twitter, as well as the reaction to those reactions. After the dust settled, bloggers also began to provide their thoughts about the matter.

Initial opinions on Twitter were ones of disbelief that a former beauty queen would be nominated to participate in the elections in such a high-ranking position.
Diego Arrázola (@darrazola) wrote:
Akmal Shaikh, a British citizen convicted of smuggling heroine into China, was executed on Tuesday although his families along with the British government had pleaded for reprieve, claiming that he is mentally ill.
The supreme court of China however dismissed the request of a mental assessment because the documents provided by the British embassy cannot prove that Akmal is mentally disordered.
After the inject of Akmal by lethal injection, the British government and some right organizations reacted fiercely.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the execution and said he was ""particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken."
Facing the critique, China expressed strong discontent.
The spokesman of foreign ministry said the accusation is groundless and warned that the intervention might damage the bilateral relations between the two countries.
In China, drug trafficking is considered as a felony.
Carrying or selling heroine of more than 50 grams will get death penalty according to the Chinese law, and over 4000 grams were found on Akmal.
To many Chinese netizens, the incident reminded them of the 2 Opium Wars fought in 19 century that British troop invaded China because Chinese officials burned up the opium sold by British.
China lost the war and suffered from the "100 years of humiliation" since then.
On 163.com, a major portal website in China, over 3000 people supported a comment left after the news piece, which writes:
Following Google's announcement today that (don't snicker) if the Chinese government won't let the company's China operations stop censoring search results Google China will be shut down, netizens trekked to Google's Beijing office to lay flowers.
UPDATE: more photos here, formal flowering of Google China offices scheduled for later today.
Bodyguards and Assassins is an action movie released during Christmas in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
As a patriotic film, it was originally set to release in October for celebrating the 60th year anniversary of PRC but deferred until the end of 2009.
In contrast with the Founding of a Republic! which spotlights on national heroes, the movie features on a number of grassroots characters, who know nothing about revolution but choose to sacrifice their lives for their country.
The story offers a diverse readings and interpretations on the Chinese history and politics.
The comment made by Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Republic of China, in the movie has been quoted widely on the Internet, it said:
What’s going on with Google?
Millions of Chinese netizens are wondering.
On Google China’s Blackboard, a Chinese-language blog run by Google.cn, a post titled ‘clear the air of rumors’ stated:

According to Mohammed Hagos, democracy project in Eritrea has to start with the removal of the current regime: "The hurdle preventing the Eritrean people from having their say is the Issayas regime.
The path to democracy thus starts with removing the Issayas regime as quickly as possible..."
Berhanu Nega, one of the men sentenced to death by an Ethiopian court says he is not suprised by death penalty.
Perhaps the most buzzing topic in the Georgian social media scene was not politics, elections, sport, crisis, earthquakes or catastrophe.
Instead, one of the most discussed topics was actually about a new television show, Ghame Shorenastan.
Shown on Imedi TV, the title translates as Night with Shorena and covers topics about sex.
As the first to do so, and with former Georgian Playboy Playmate Shorena Begashvili, the show received a lot of feedback online, both positive and negative.
NightGravity was certainly delighted.
There was not a main topic, and it looked like a MTV program.
During 45 minutes there was 20 minutes of advertisements and 20 minutes of MTV song videos :D last 5 minutes were "hello, goodbye, sex is not bad, sex is good" :D
Lishtota even conducted an online poll asking "When will "night with Shorena" be cancelled?"
Another blogger, Giorgi Benashvili was surprised that people did not react strongly against the show, especially as the authors and producers expected a scandal. "Today, in the year 2009, teaching sex via television is not relevant anymore - this is the conclusion which is reached because of the silence with which the programme was greeted and which was not expected by its authors or me.
If the show was made in 2001, I can imagine the effect it would have, as opposed to that we have now."
In fact, the lack of adverse reactions lead many to suppose that society, or at least that part of it online, was ready for such a show.
Many posts on blogs and forums even complain that the show was not informative enough, as one comment complains.
Réseau Citadelle announces the launch of the Media Operations Center, an initiative from Reporters without Borders and Quebecor, aimed at facilitating the field work of local and foreign journalists in Haiti as well as establishing collaboration between the media and NGOs.
So far the casualty reports from Haiti's earthquake have focused on the terrifying statistics, but very few names had been attached to those numbers.
Unfortunately, today, popular Dominican blogger Guillermo Peña confirmed he lost his father, Guillermo Peña Sr., in the disaster.
The elder Peña was working in Port au Prince as an engineer with the Santo Domingo construction firm Mera, Muñoz & Fondeur.
A coworker of Mr. Pena's also died.
A third was injured but has been successfully evacuated to Plaza de la Salud hospital in Santo Domingo and is receiving treatment.
Many Dominican and Spanish-language bloggers have already expressed their condolences to Guillermo Peña, Jr., who is posting his thoughts via Twitter.
The DR is feeling the quake’s aftermath in other ways.
Dominican blogger Jose Sille’ claims, also via Twitter, that CESFRONT, the Dominican border patrol, is beginning to encounter Haitians desperate to flee the country.
EV:....She is fine.
She has no news about the rest of the family though...given that no transport is functioning everybody is on foot, so its really difficult to communicate.
Interviewer: And your mother, whereabouts on the island was she at the time?
EV: She was in Port-au Prince itself, the epicentre of the quake.
Interviewer: She told you what happened on the telephone?
EV: She told me what happened to her, we can't tell what it was like everywhere.
She was in a restaurant at the time the earthquake started, so there was a lot of panic.
Some people died in the restaurant itself, as it caved in.
She managed to get out.
Since then...well, since then, people are in the streets...well, those who had not had injuries that were too serious in any case.
Interviewer: Are you worried?
EV: For my mother- well, she is ok, everything is fine.
For the rest of the family... we just don't know at the moment, we haven't heard anything...we are waiting for news.
There have been victims, and many injured...
Interviewer: And psychologically is your mother ok?
EV: My goodness!
She has seen a lot in her life, but she is ok, she is alright.
On the ground in Port au Prince, others are still collecting themselves.
Survivor Jean Francois Labadie posted his recollections of the disaster a few hours after midnight this morning:
13/01/2010 00:25 First earthquake, umpteenth tremor
12:30 PM : We really need to wish it would be the last one... Seriously, never live twice...
Towards 4:45 PM, with our driver, we enter the parking lot of Karibean, Pétion-ville's big mart.
As usual, the way in is slowed by the usual Delmas traffic.
While driving up the entry, our Patrol began to dance.
I was imagining three or four boys standing on the bumper wanting to swing the car.
In front of us, the parking lot ground rocked like the waves at Wahoo Bay.
The Karibean building started to dance and in 3 seconds' time completely tumbled down.
A white cloud swept across the parking lot and you could see zombies whitened by dust appearing, in complete panic.
Once the dust has settled again - although the phrase is premature - the heap of concrete from the 4-storied building seems to leave no survivor.
Madness has taken over the passers-by trying to seek refuge in the Patrol while the security guards - including one seriously wounded - shut the gate behind us.
The driver, having understood quicker than me what was the matter, is putting all his efforts into praying.
He yells his incantations, his arms to the sky.
Far from piercing my eardrums, he calms me down.
He is giving sense to this madness going on under our eyes.
After five minutes of torpor, the few motorists able to drive back home force the guards to open the 15 ft high fence.
The sight of Delmas looks distressing, astounding.
We will be driving for an hour between collapsed buildings, people running, weeping and yelling their faith in Jesus and calling him with arm signs, heads whitened by dust eying in disbelief, injured people, corpses or bits of them...Jean-Claude goes on energetically singing his faith during the whole trip.
My atheism is being lulled by my colleague's religious enthusiasm.
The scenes unfold as in a movie seen a thousand times.
I even manage to keep down my anxiety not being able to get back to Jehanne by noticing that the one-storied buildings held out the tremors.
I'll hug her before she understands how big the disaster is, as things were better in her part of town.
We get ready for our first night fearing the tremors which filled our evening.
Our landlord-architect has our complete trust.
Till later.
As of this afternoon, the first aid flights are reported to have landed at Haiti’s main airport. Global Voices' Special Coverage Page on the earthquake in Haiti is here.
Rocio Diaz reported from Santo Domingo.
French translations by Suzanne Lehn and Katharine Ganly.
The first blog posts written in French about the earthquake in Haiti have come from outside the country, announcing terrible news of the Presidential Palace , a hospital and other buildings collapsing and also of the threat of a tsunami.
According to MetropoleHaiti, The USA have already proposed humanitarian assistance.
Here are some maps that humanitarian aid responders are using to communicate the evolving situation in Haiti’s earthquake zone.
The Ushahidi Network has created a very detailed interactive map overlaying information on threats, people needing assistance, medical care, food and other aid availability by type.
The map is being updated as information is received via the Ushahidi network, Twitter and Web form.
Ushahidi's Erik Hersman, in an email message, said the system was processing mostly web and Twitter communication in the first days after the quake, because cell networks were down in much of southern Haiti.
That's changing and cell service, which is more widely distributed, "is bringing in a lot more reports."
Crisis Commons, a network of technology professionals that creates tools for humanitarian relief response, has announced that it has undertaken a similar project to map relief efforts and to generate a crisis-specific baseline map of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, for relief agencies to use as planning reference.
The project has just begun.
In New York City, the New York Public Library has a series of maps online showing camps where survivors are finding shelter.
A second set identifies damaged areas and buildings.
They are being edited and updated.
Most other imagery is not interactive, but arguably gives a broader overview of the situation.
This image from the Center for Satellite Based Crisis Information measures distances from the quake’s epicenter to where people lived in southern Haiti pre-quake.
It’s color-coded to reflect population density.
According to the map, the Hatian state of Leogane, though it has not been identified by name in many news reports, was the quake’s epicenter, and contains several heavily-populated areas.
Carrefour, a large suburb of Port-au-Prince, is on Leogane state's border.
The city of Jacmel, on the coast, is also in Leogane and badly damaged.
As of late yesterday, broken roads and bridges were still cutting off the area, which is closer to the epicenter than Port au Prince is, from receiving aid.
The US Geological Survey has put information into a very easy to read chart of cities by population, color-coded by the quake’s intensity.
The result is a very fast way to understand just how many people were living in the places hit hardest by the disaster.
USGS has also posted a map of the earthquake reports it has received by phone.
It shows perceptions from people phoning the USGS to tell them what they saw.
The NYTimes has created a three-dimensional map that is extremely useful for understanding where Port-au-Prince lies in relation to Haiti’s geology.
It shows the city in a coastal plan at the foot of a range of mountains that complicate aid delivery.
The Times' map also explains very clearly the location of several neighborhoods where medical aid and food distribution has begun, and shelter has become haltingly available.
Direct satellite imagery is available here.
Orbital images taken as recently as yesterday are being compared to images of Port-au-Prince and the environs before the quake, like this one.
The satellite view can determine damage and needs in areas that still do not have reliable communication.
In theory, night imagery should be able to tell us something similar about electricity, the availability of light, and perhaps fuel.
But if those images are in use, they haven’t been made public yet.

As the horror of the earthquake in Haiti reverberates around the world, a number of intrepid locals, foreign reporters, and aid workers are tweeting from on the ground.
Some are working to gather aid and funds, while others are simply trying to show the world what's happening in Haiti.
Still others are reporting on incidents in specific locations, in the hopes of assuaging the concerns of loved ones abroad (as of yet, very little information on those injured and dead has been released online).
Earlier today, many people on the ground were tweeting about the chaos in Haiti at present. @fredodupoux said:
fredodupoux is based in Haiti
@bhatiap noted the lack of police presence:
bhatiap noted the lack of police presence
Boston-based @PIH_org (Partners in Health) is actively looking for doctors, specifically orthopedic surgeons, to send to Haiti:
A Boston-based organization is seeking volunteer doctors
Some Twitter users are reporting on specific buildings, streets, and other practical information for those looking for families or attempting to move throughout the country. @yatalley notes that the road from the capital, Port-au-Prince, to the town of Jacmel is impassable:
Yael Talleyrand reports from Jacmel, Haiti
@RAMHaiti noted the widespread destruction of places of worship.
Reporting on a specific Port au Prince church, he said:
Richard Morse is tweeting from Port au Prince
@fredodupoux ventured into the district of Delmas outside of Port au Prince, an area which received the brunt of the damage.
Frederic Dupoux noted massive destruction in Delmas, Haiti
As tweets keep pouring in, there are a number of ways to keep track. @georgiap has created a list of Twitter users on the ground in Haiti.
I have a separate list which also contains aid organizations and reporters on the ground.
And keep checking GV's Haiti Special Coverage Page.
Those of us outside of Haiti can only imagine the stark reality of daily life in the earthquake's aftermath - but amidst attempts to find loved ones, efforts to administer to the wounded and the overwhelming task of getting relief to those who most need it - bloggers in and around Port-au-Prince are finding the time to communicate with the outside world, which is desperate for news from those closest to the disaster.
The Livesay Weblog has been really committed to updating its posts, with Troy, the head of the family, tweeting regularly and posting images to his flickr photostream.
Troy, an American doing missionary work in Haiti, does not hide his admiration for the tenacity of the Haitian people:
The amount of the current suffering caused by the earthquake cannot possibly be known right now ... the numbers cannot be estimated.
But, if the way they deal with day to day hardship is any indication - the people of Haiti will rise.
His wife, Tara, also offers handy information:
Diesel is going to go fast and will be needed for any sort of communication.
Coming down if you are not willing to risk and get in and clean out horrific wounds would just tax an already taxed place.
Medical professionals should contact organizations with the ability to coordinate efforts and try to get here.
It won't help to have more non-medical people to feed and house.
Hope that does not sound harsh - but it is truth.
Heart wrenching testimonies and photographs were also coming from how can they hear:
On my way out, I saw our dresser moving, the kitchen cabinets shake and spit out all sorts of cans, and the house moving as if it was made out of jello.
I had never seen anything like that.
But I only realized it was an earthquake when I finally got outside and saw people running in all directions.
Some crying.
Some rushing.
Others wailing.
Wailing as if life was pulled from within them.
The blog also offers information on how best to help in the midst of an untenable situation, which, judging by the blog's most recent post, is worsening:
Things are starting to get a little scary.
We realize that the destruction in Jacmel is more than we first thought.
I just found out that there are still hundreds of people here in Jacmel trapped under the rubble.
You can smell the dead people in the downtown area where much damage occurred.
The other question is the issue of water.
Will it run out soon?
Will we be able to have access anywhere to clean safe water?
I don’t know.
Pwoje Espwa - Hope in Haiti also blogs about their experiences:
The local general hospital is already filled with people who were hurt in the capitol.
There are doctors and nurses but nothing else.
No medicine, no sheets, no bandages, no food for them.
Some are languishing on the floor.
Keep them and us in your prayers.
The blog's most recent update talks about the fact that "EdH (Electricite d'Haiti) will start rolling out rations of electricity as the fuel supply is dwindling":
The plan is to provide electricity at night for security and a few hours during the day.
Only one gas station is open at this time and folks are predicting super high prices.
Met a man on the street this morning who comes from Jacmel which was hit hard by the earthquake.
He was talking to himself in Kreyole, French, Spanish with a sprinkling of English.
He spoke to me but I could not make out what he was saying.
He abruptly turned away and walked into the darkness.
Witnessing the massive destruction and loss of life can make anyone lose it.
Blesh Family in Haiti Weblog also posts information:
The situation is quite bad.
Most of the major markets for food are crumbled.
The banking system is down.
There is only partial internet and cell phone service.
To make it clear from someone on the ground here…I have not kept up with the news and who is doing what but I’ll tell you that Haiti is a mess.
The infrastructure is in shambles.
Still, partial Internet access in the context of such widespread devastation is nothing short of a small miracle - and Multilink Haiti, one of the country's Internet Service Providers, has taken the initiative and started tweeting, providing much-needed information and re-tweeting pleas to help find missing loved ones.
One of the most dedicated users of Twitter is hotelier Richard Morse, whose coverage of the situation has been stellar.
Changing Perspectives, while located in neighbouring DR, posts a report from a missionary located near Jeremie in Haiti:
Our phones are still out and not working and there is no way for people to get to Port to check on their families even if they wanted to.
We have no boats coming to Jeremie and we hear that the road to Cayes across the mountains is ruined in several places and no vehicles can pass.
This means that families can not get to Port to find out where their families are.
This is very, very hard on everyone.
In a later post, she gives news about an apparently under-utilised hospital in the north of the island:
Hopital Sacre Coeur (Sacred Heart Hospital) is full-service hospital, fully staffed, volunteer teams both on site and standing by, ready to go.
We have operating rooms and beds.
We have discharged other patients whose condition is less serious.
We have cleared a soccer field for helicopter landing.
Real Hope For Haiti Rescue Center, meanwhile, is also trying to help with medical aid and writes:
I do not pretend to understand the suffering that is happening right now in this country.
I know we all feel like we had had enough over the years.
The staff has come in to work.
They are praying for their loves ones in town.
They are hoping for news and believing that they will soon here from them.
Mothers and father are weeping for their lost children.
Children are crying for their lost parents.
The reality is even when the outside world begins , what can be done?
Still, the outside world wants to know.

A video interview of Kyo Kageura, head of the project Minna no Honyaku (みんなの翻訳, Translation for all) , a new translation platform that helps NGOs and NPOs to spread their messages thanks to volunteer translators.
Global Voices Japan asked him about the challenge of Minna no Honyaku , the difficulties and the new frontiers of volunteer translation.
The project Minna no Honyaku or Translation for all is the brainchild of Language Translation Group of the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology and Library and Information Science Laboratory of the University of Tokyo, in cooperation with publishing company Sanseido.
Thought as a part of the Shiitake Project, the realization of a platform to stimulate the growth of online translation has a precise purpose:
This system will ultimately enable individual translators to form a network, without any additional or conscious effort, in which translators working on similar or related domains can collectively accumulate translation data and share information relevant to their translations.
This, we believe, will enhance the activity of translators and encourage potential translators to join in.
As such, the Shiitake project is ultimately a social project.
Lastly, with the aim to make translation an easy process also to inexperienced translators, Professor Kageura's team created Minna no Honyaku, convinced that:
The translation of news and reports by volunteers plays a vital role in this alternative information flow.

As people around the world get closer through modern technology, and cultural and racial barriers give way to mutual understanding and respect; and interracial marriages are becoming more common.
A number of mixed race and religion families are sharing their experiences in the blogosphere.
To look at a culture and country through the eyes of an outsider is a learning experience.
At InterracialMarriage, the blogger-an Australian male is married to a Chinese woman who happens to be an atheist.
Writing about the way they celebrated Christmas as family with their son, he finds himself in a fix trying to make sense of his wife's atheist views and belief in traditional Chinese rituals.
"Ms B may not believe in God because of a lack of proof, but this does not stop her believing in Luck, or in Feng Shui, or in Numerology, or in any other number of cultish beliefs that seem to have widespread basis within the Chinese community.
I sometimes notice Ms B performing strange rituals at home to ward off Bad Luck, and she has even cost us a lot of money in re-positioning our front and back doors, in order to capture Good Luck in our home through good Feng Shui.
Now I too see no basis in these beliefs, but I tolerate them for Ms B's sake. I guess this is what she too does for me with my religion."
When it comes to a foreign culture reading between lines does not come easily, it seems; even when you marry someone from that culture.
But what do you do when you try to embrace your significant other's cultural practices and end up standing out among colleagues?
At GoriGirl the blogger, a white woman married to an Indian Bengali man, shares her experience of "wearing sindoor as a white woman".
Hindu married women wear Sindoor (vermilion power) on their forehead and this practice is common in many parts of India and Nepal.
But how about the practice in Washington DC?
"No, my problem with wearing sindoor is that most days I’m headed into work where there are a fair number of Indian people.
And none of them wear traditional Indian clothing, except for the occasional short kurta – certainly there isn’t any sindoor-wearing going on among the married ladies!
One older Bengali coworker even expressed amazement that I followed the “old-fashioned” tradition of wearing a loha – a gold-plated iron bangle that serves as a wedding ring among Bengali women – on my left wrist daily. ............On the third hand (yes, yes, I know), the last time I wore sindoor to the office, my boss wanted to know if I needed a band-aid for the cut on my head.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Does anyone else have problems with this?"
Standing out was also in mind of TheGoriWifeLife blogger, who is an American married to a Pakistani man.
She writes about what she is wearing while visiting Pakistan:
"This time, I brought two pairs of jeans and a few shirts because I thought that at least around the house I wanted to be comfortable, since that is my daily uniform back home.
But somehow I've ended up wearing jeans paired with a Pakistani shirt and dupatta when we go out probably as many times as I've worn shalwar kameez.
We've even gone on several walks around the neighborhood and it feels totally normal and at ease.
Somehow things seem different this time."
Difficulty of understanding and being accepted in a different culture is something interracial couples face regularly.
Sometimes they also face questions about the basis of their relationship, and when marriage and immigration status get mixed up it is not comfortable.
At IndiaTies, blogger Heather Lurdkee, an American married to an Indian questions people who see interracial marriage as a status symbol or a way to get permanent residency status.
" For my husband, being married to me (a white girl) isn't much of a status symbol - he didn't go out looking specifically for an American or a white girl.
He didn't "need me" in order to get somewhere in life.
We just happened to be at the right place at the right time and things worked out.
However, some of my husband's Indian friends have expressed their desire to find a white girl to my husband.
One friend (from India - who recently came to the States) actually said to my husband, "Wow, you've got it made, I have to find a white girl like you..." And he was serious! "
The trial and tribulations of interracial couples show a mirror to how far we-as a civilization have come in accepting and respecting differences.
These blogs are part of that mirror and are also a tool in cultural and social understanding. Thumbnail image by United Nations Photo. Used under a creative commons license
Matthew Cassel reports the suicide of Theresa Seda, a Filipino domestic worker in Beirut.
Read the chilling details of how such suicides- which have been increasing in numbers- are going ignored at Justimage.
Condolences poured in on Twitter after an Ethiopian Airlines jet plunged into the Mediterranean minutes after its take off from Beirut, Lebanon.
All 90 people on board are presumed dead after the plane caught fire during a lightning storm and crashed into the sea.
@tsepeaces retweets an eye witness as saying:
RT @patrickgaley: Eyewitness Naame "We saw an explosion in the sky like the sun, it was there for seconds then vanished into darkness"#ET409
He also tweets:
The plane was a ball of flame for a second - these are haunting words :-/ #ET409 May they all Rest in Peace!
Daily Star reporter and Huffington Post blogger Patrick Galey quotes a Lebanese man who lost 10 friends on board the flight:
Fouad Shihab, 10 friends on board: "I was meant to be on that plane and look what happened.
All my friends are dead."
In an earlier tweet, he writes:
Just returned from Rafiq Hariri airport, scenes there are terrible.
No information, spoke with people who have lost entire family
Hichame Assi (@hiconomics) writes:
Very sad to hear about #ET409... I hope it's as painless as possible to all family and friends.
Allah Yer7am (May God have mercy on them)
Georges Azzi, who has been following the coverage on television, wasn't impressed and tweeted:
Lebanon: too many TV Stations= too much airtime #et409 #coverage switching into sensational and fictional mode #fail
Samer, who tweets @meetsamer, also expressed outrage at Lebanese media saying:
Lebanese media has no decency or any sense of ethics, they're already referring to the missing ppl as "dead" #ET409 #Lebanon
Amer Tabsh (@arzleb) shares similar sentiments and writes:
LBC (Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation) analysis of the #ET409 is very stupid and wrongful #fail
He also shares the hotline number for information and inquires on the crash:
Meanwhile, Tala is shaken by the news and tweets:
25 bodies have been taken out of the water, 2 of them were children.
And they hardly identify any of them.
R.I.P #ET409
CNN's Cal Perry was also tweeting and in one message says:
Such a sad day #et409 - tomorrow we'll try to get down to the beach.
Tonight's piece from the airport.
PM Hariri trying his best to console
Nathan Redd is in agony and writes:
I seriously cannot concentrate on anything today. #ET409 is the only thing on my mind today.
My heart is broken.
And @nightS sums up the day saying:
It's a very sad and horrible day :( #ET409
Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929 and became arguably the American Civil Rights Movement's most prominent advocate and speaker.
In the United States, he is honored by a national holiday, observed the third Monday in January of each year.
Today, many bloggers in the United States are honoring his memory with dedicated posts, linking his legacy of social justice with issues of today, demonstrating that 42 years after King's assassination, his words are just as relevant.
Many Americans thought that Barack Obama’s election was the culmination of Dr. King’s dream and concrete proof that we have evolved into a “post-racial,” colorblind society.
Unfortunately, as I and many other sociologists and commentators have argued, even in this past year, we have seen numerous incidents that illustrate just how prevalent racial distinctions and racism still are in American society.
Following the discussion of numerous examples of racial issues in the United States, the blogger concludes:
Ultimately, the best way for us to work toward achieving the ultimate colorblind ideal is to recognize, accept, and understand that racial distinctions still matter and that they are still the basis for continuing discrimination and inequality in American society today.
Only by doing so will we move forward on achieving Dr. King’s final ideal — true racial equality.
Global Voices' own Lova Rakotomalala, who is from Madagascar but resides in the United States, wrote a post entitled "Lesson from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to Madagascar," in which he said (in reference to the events in Madagascar last year):
Leadership matters.
Real leaders give speeches and then walk the talk, in front of the line.
Leaders do not vanish in a sheltered place when they know things are about to get dangerous and let protesters walk in harm's way to serve their agenda.
The only thing we know for sure about what really happened in Madagascar a year ago is that we could have used a Dr. King back then.
US-based blog Immigration Impact drew parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and immigration today, writing:
Now, more than ever, it’s important to remember Dr. King’s message that all men are created equal—not just for Hispanics and African Americans, but for all people who come to this country in search of the American Dream.
The blogger behind Preventing Homelessness reminds us that honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. means service:
Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
A day for all of us to work to improve lives, bridge social barriers, and move our nation closer to the “Beloved Community” that Dr. King envisioned.
Today is a day of service, but we don't have to stop there.
We can resolve to make this a year of service and make a real difference in our community!
And last but not least, the anti-racist blog Racism Review leaves us with a thought about heeding King's lessons:
This Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day, I hope and pray we will learn the lessons Dr. King taught us.
Regardless of what the majority of people say, progressive American rhetoric remains miles ahead of its deeds (see King’s brilliant sermon “Paul’s Letter to American Christians”) and gradualism is not the answer.
Only collective action, creative and sustained civil disobedience, and mobilization of people of color and poor–for whom cooptation and/or cessation are not viable options—are the only potential means for achieving and sustaining real and systemic change.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a special status given by the United States to foreign nationals from specific countries where there has been some sort of recent turmoil or trauma, such as war or an earthquake.
The status requires that the individual already be in the United States, and the individual must apply for consideration under TPS.
Currently, TPS is given to citizens of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, and Sudan.
As the name implies, the status is temporary and does not automatically qualify an individual for permanent residency (green card) or citizenship.
This week, following the horrific 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti, a number of politicians and journalists began calling on the United States to give TPS to the one to two million (by most estimates) Haitian nationals that live in the country.
Several petitions, including one by breakthrough, were circulated, and 83 Congresspersons signed a letter to President Obama requesting TPS for Haitians.
On Friday, January 15, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano granted TPS to all Haitians currently living in the US for eighteen months.
Prior to the announcement, blogger The Latin Americanist noted:
Haitian expats and immigration advocates have long clamored for TPS for Haitians, especially in light of numerous hurricanes and major storms over the past decade.
Though their pleas had fallen on deaf ears by both the Bush and Obama administrations, support for Haitian TPS has gained backing from key lawmakers
Also prior to the decision, American blogger and immigration scholar Koulflo Memo called TPS a "no-brainer":
The right wing Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has announced opposition to granting TPS for Haiti.
The reason they give is that they assume Haitians won’t leave after TPS is lifted.
They also say the Haiti situation does not meet TPS criteria.
FAIR’s opposition is dishonest and wrongheaded.
It is also racist.
I hope President Obama is not over-calculating his chances for comprehensive immigration reform later this year by appeasing the FAIR constituency on this crucial humanitarian issue.
Such a non-response would indeed forsake Haiti in its time of need.
American blogger Deep Thought commended the Obama administration's decision, writing:
President Obama showed real leadership in moving quickly to help the people of Haiti.
He and Secretary Napolitano also showed compassion in suspending deportations to Haiti for eighteen months by granting TPS (temporary protected status) to Haitians currently in the United States; dumping a bunch more people into the current scene of devastation would be unhelpful at best and disastrous at worst.
Yes, they are getting some heat from Nativist groups but the real test of leadership is the ability to make tough decisions because they are right.
Blogger and adoptive parent all buttoned up discusses thanking her representative for pushing for TPS and also requests help for Haiti's many orphans, writing:
This issue is getting a lot of press at the moment.
I hope that it makes a difference, but you and I both know that people grow tired of seeing the same sadness over and over again.
There were more than 200,000 orphans living in Port-au-Prince before all of this began, and however you feel about these issues- and they are complicated- none of this intervention is meant to undermine the integrity of the Haitian people or their desire to look after their own children.
It is just not possible for them to do so.
This is a humanitarian issue.
Although Haitians in the United States are now protected for the next 18 months at minimum and able to work, the people of Haiti still need help.
Here are a few organizations providing relief in Haiti, and here are a few ways you can donate hotel or frequent flier miles.

Respect Religions by Sarah Carr
Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7.
On the eve of their celebrations in Egypt, Copts go to churches and celebrate the holy event.
But this year an unexpected incident happened in Naga Hammady, in Upper Egypt, where an unknown criminal opened his fire randomly on people there after they finished their prayers and were on their way back to their homes.
Zeinobia wrote a new post about the massacre in her blog saying:
I am really very sorry and angry for what happened in Naj Hammadi yesterday.
It hurts me more than the Egyptian Christians because what happened is against all Egyptians.
My condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured in this disgusting attack.
Another blog, Coptic File, wrote about the incident: A shooting gun was used from inside a car (green Fiat), to randomly kill eight people and many others were wounded.
She also blames the ministry of interior for the whole thing: And with my all respect this is ridiculous , fighting a crime by a group of crimes.
I blame the ministry of interior in all of this , if there is a real respect and fear of the law nothing of this could happen.
Also, Nawara shares echoes similar sentiments.
On the Ministry of Interior's press release regarding the shooting, she says: The strangest release I've ever read in my entire life, I've never seen a press release blaming the victims and encouraging mass punishment.
More than 20 Egyptian bloggers were arrested when their train arrived in the village of Naga Hammady in Upper Egypt.
Led by Dr Mostafa Al Naggar, the bloggers left Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities in Egypt to pay their respects to the families of the victims of the Naga Hammady massacre.
Seven Christian Copts were shot dead on the eve of their Christmas, on January 7.
Many others were injured as they left a church after the Christmas mass.
The bloggers unpoliticized visit to Naga Hammady was halted when the bloggers got off the train.

Most if not all these bloggers are among the famous citizen journalists.
I do not understand why these bloggers have been detained.
In late December, the Council of Ministers of Mozambique made a significant announcement.
A 30,000ha land concession to biofuels firm Procana in the District of Massingir had been revoked.
The Mozambican Land Law, passed in 1997, is quite unique.
Land was nationalized at independence, and the Land Law did not change this.
It gives the state clear tools for managing land use.
Private sector investors must seek 50 year land-use rights agreements, known as DUAT, or "Land Use and Benefit Rights".
These DUATs are not binding for the full 50 years until after an interim two year period, when investors have to prove that they use the land productively.
The case of the Procana DUAT, a massive area bordering on the cross-border Limpopo National Park, was polemic from the beginning in 2007.
Communities were to be resettled from the Park area to the lands then subsequently conceded to Procana for sugarcane production.
These communities needed the lands for grazing, as they survive from cattle rearing.
There appeared to be no real plan to deal with the brewing conflict.
Moreover, there were worries that Procana's need for water would disturb local food production.
Civil society groups supported the communities in their negotiations with Park officials through a project called Lhuvuka, but there appeared to be no progress with Procana.

Lhuvuka's website has an article that claims the conflicts were summed up
Nigerian curiosity writes about the case of Uzoma Okere in Nigeria: "Uzoma Okere is the young Nigerian lady whose assault by military officers became a viral video that raised the ire of many."
A partylist group in the Philippines wants to introduce a law that would put a ten-year expiration date on marriage contracts.
The unique proposal is the group’s answer to lengthy and expensive annulment proceedings in the country.
The Catholic-dominated Philippines does not have a divorce law.
According to the group, the “Renewable Marriage Bill” would “spare incompatible couples the expense of lengthy legal proceedings before their marriages are annulled.”
The group added that a marriage contract “should be just like a passport or driver’s license.
If we are not interested to renew it, then it expires.”
More than 500,000 marriages are administered by the Catholic Church every year with less than 10 percent getting annulled and reported.
As expected, the proposed marriage license with expiration date generated an intense reaction in the blogosphere.
Writing for Lex Fori Philippines, Oscar underscores the impact of this proposal on property relations.
If we are going to equate marriage with a driver’s license, can we then take the future spouse for a test drive?
That way, both persons will be spared from having to go through renewing or not renewing the expirable marriage license and save them money from holding the costly marriage ceremony.
Supposing that marriage will expire in ten years, what will happen to the property relations after 10 years? the validity of contracts entered into by the spouses jointly?
Do we liquidate the properties, terminate valid contracts, and tell the children to expect lesser legitimes in the event one or both their parents remarry and have additional children?
John Odonnell R. Petalcorin prefers a bill that would decrease the cost of annulment case proceedings
...if the proposal was conceptualized because of the expensive annulment case proceedings, I would rather propose a counter-bill to put a price cap on the cost of annulment.
To make the process speedy, we can also incorporate a provision that the annulment can be approved immediately if both the husband and wife will exchange a verbally denounciation of their love for each other for three times
Ice9web Blog wonders whether a new marriage vow will be uttered in ceremonies
If this will happen, gone are the days when the marriage vows are to be taken seriously "Til death do us part"?
Now what will the vow be?
Till renewal to us part?
Some said that this will be the answer here in Philippines, since we don't have divorce and annulment takes time and lots of money... is renewal really the answer?
Pinoy Politico doesn’t understand why incompatible couples have to wait for ten years before they can terminate their marriage
I don't understand why a person has to wait for a decade just to ditch his cheating wife.
This is also the same for the women.
If my husband beats me up everyday after 1 year of marriage, why should I wait for 9 years more?
Maybe you should propose daily renewal so that you can check their marriage status.
Capt. Nemo is supportive of the proposal
well this proposition just want to address the PRESENT situation that most of the Filipino couples are facing nowadays.
Based on my perception, this is for the better and a solution that treat both sexes equality regarding marriage.
For annulment can be acquired by those who are capable to “pay” the process.
How about the poor who want to put an end in their not working relationship, can they go with the same process? this proposition will motivate couples to value their existing relationship.
In fact, they have the FREE WILL to either renew their marriage contracts or just junk the paper after 10 years.
Jappysworld is concerned about the welfare of children if a couple decides not to renew their marriage
This is not the solution.
I do understand that there are many people who couldn’t stand being married a minute longer, but what would happen to the children if this proposal takes effect.
This may be beneficial to estranged couples but their children would be the one to suffer the most.
It’s like saying on the 1st day after the 10th year of Marriage; a married person could do anything they want without regarding their responsibility and loyalty to their family.
Maureen Flores believes the proposed bill bypasses the sanctity of marriage
This has been a laughing matter between my husband and I over the week.
We're celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary today, you see.
But really, the proposed 10-year expiry on marriage contracts is not funny.
I am also expressing my sincere disapproval on this proposal.
I am concerned about how it will affect families and our society itself should this be passed.
The sanctity of marriage is bypassed.
On January 18 Global Voices will launch the Technology for Transparency Network, a collaborative research mapping of internet projects that promote greater transparency, government accountability, and civic engagement.
This is the first in a series of posts that will explore related issues through the eyes of bloggers worldwide.
To kick things off we look at how bloggers responded to International Anti-Corruption Day, which was signed into law in 2003 at the United Nations Convention against Corruption and takes place every year on December 9th.
On Space for Transparency, the official blog of Transparency International, Georg Neumann looks back at the state of anti-corruption activism for 2009:
Increasingly, anti-corruption activists have been in the line of attack.
Activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Guatemala or Zimbabwe have faced threats or were being silenced.
Anti-Corruption Day stands for a day to remember, recognise and honour these brave and fearless people, who went to prison or lost their lives believing that through fighting corruption they will make the world a better place.
Neumann also notes that 2009 saw the passing of a flawed review mechanism which doesn't require member states to seek input from independent NGO's based in their countries.
In a five-minute YouTube video Peter Eigen, the founder of Transparency International, describes the important role of civil society in fighting corruption and improving governance:
But it wasn't all bad news in 2009, writes Neumann.
There are now 40 Advocacy and Legal Advice Centers worldwide providing legal advice to victims of corruption.
Also, online social media has proven itself a powerful tool in promoting transparency and fighting against corruption.
In India, for example, J. N. Jayashree started a wiki to protect her husband whose safety was threatened as a result of his whistle-blowing activities.
In Morocco an anonymous anti-corruption activist has begun posting videos to YouTube of police officers accepting bribes.
Arruda Out'.

In Brazil violence broke out on Anti-Corruption Day between police and protesters:
Protesters have been demanding the impeachment of the Governor of the Federal District, Jose Roberto Arruda, and his deputy, Paulo Octavio, in addition to a thorough investigation into all parties cited in the bribery scandal that led to a police operation codenamed Pandora Box.
According to the investigation, Governor Arruda is the possible head of a R$ 600,000 (approximately $340,000) per month bribery scheme that has benefited allies among district members of parliament, businessmen and government officials.
Global Voices editors also point readers to a number of posts around the blogosphere related to transparency, corruption, and government accountability.
Peter Marton looks at the harmful role of corruption in rebuilding Afghanistan.
In Ukraine, meanwhile, Petro congratulates the residents of Kabul for sentencing their mayor to four years of prison for corruption and imagines how quickly Kyiv's prisons would fill up if the same laws were enforced in his country.
Writing in Registan.net, Alexander Visotzky looks at the corruption charges against Mukhtar Dzhakishev for the illegal sale of Uranium and concludes, "The fight against corruption in Kazakhstan is apparently much more of a political game than an attempt to root out corruption."
Writing from Japan, Scilla Alecci points to Transparency International's Ten Worst Corruption Cases of 2009 in Japan.
Finally, writing from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, "Gil the Jenius" asks for tougher punishments against public officials convicted of corruption.
Looking back on anti-corruption activism in 2009 we see that an entrenched culture of corruption is still pervasive worldwide.
But we also see a growing online discussion about what can be done to curb corruption, promote transparency, and increase civic engagement.
In future posts we'll look more specifically at online discussions and internet-based projects to promote transparency and fight against corruption in Nigeria and China.
Malawians are digesting news that the country's president Dr Bingu wa Mutharika is on May 1 to marry his former tourism minister Callister Chimombo.
This will be preceeded by a tradional custom engament on Valenetine's Day 14 February.
A couple of bloggers have wished the president well in his new found love following the death of his wife Ethel three years ago.
Emmanuel Sobilika of Malawi Digest writes:
In a press statement issued on Wednesday made available to Malawi Digest, the State House says that President Mutharika is expected to marry Chimombo on 1st May, 2010.
However, before the official marriage itself, the two will have their traditional custom engagement on 14th February, 2010.
14th February is the world’s Valentines Day where people commemorate love with their loved ones.
The official statement discloses that both Dr Mutharika and Miss Callista Chapola Chimombo are a widower and widow respectively.
State House says that both Dr Bingu wa Mutharika and Chimombo are devout Roman Catholics.
Journalist Kondwani Munthali congratulates the president for what he calls:
leading the way by announcing their intentions for Holy Matrimony, adding hopefully we will find a card for the event and share with many of my freinds here the pictures.
Callista was spoted at several state functions sitting next to the president.
She earlier on denied the love story.
State house officials also refused to explain the protocol and justify the former minister's closeness to the president at the state functions.
Richard Chirombo in Malawi's commercial capital Blantyre wrote:
Chimombo has since mid-December 2009 been seen sitting next to Mutharika, a position reserved for high government officials and trusted pals.
Instead, Chimombo says it is the president who chooses who to sit next to him, and as such it was "just a previlege" that Mutharika has allowed her to sit next to him.
This will be the second state wedding in Malawi after Bakili Muluzi's in 1999.
President Wade, pictured here at the 2002 World Economic Forum, wants to grant Haitian earthquake survivors free land in Senegal (image source: Wikipedia)
In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake, politicians and citizens around the world have scrambled to join the global outpouring of solidarity for Haiti, and poor countries, including many in Africa, are no exception.
Rwanda, Liberia, South Africa, Gabon, Nigeria and many others have already pleged financial aid.
However, it is the 84 year-old Senegalese president, Abdoulaye Wade, who has been making headlines.
Wade is offering free land to any Haitian earthquake survivors who wish to "return to their origins," according to a spokesperson.
Online, the proposal has been received with almost universal ridicule.
Although Blog Politique au Senegal has yet to comment on either Wade's offer or the earthquake, it did post this commentary by Dr. EL Hadji Malick Ndiaye on the importance of "South-South" solidarity, published before Wade's announcement:
...Dakar, which has trouble taking off and solving its many problems related to sanitation and urbanization, whose suburbs are wading in flood waters from years past, by what means can she accommodate a population or a whole country at the other end of the world?...
Abdoulaye Wade, in a of solidarity and pan-Africanism, proposes to depopulate Haiti, thereby forgetting that charity begins at home... ... Abdoulaye Wade, very nostalgic the 19th century, believes that Marcus Garvey is still alive, and that the "Back to Africa" movement is still valid.
One day, he will eventually tell us is that the Ku Klux Klan who made the earth tremble in Haiti...each country has its own calamities.
Haiti has its own, which generate a lot of compassion, and we have ours, which do as much damage as an earthquake, such as statements by a president who has trouble staying above the fray, and whose is a source of controversy.
The Haitian people, as was said and reiterated by the President ¨"Are entitled to the African soil".
The question remains, if they want it.

Rising Voices Director David Sasaki has written a lovely retrospective for Global Voices' fifth birthday.
Five years ago this month, David traveled across the United States from California to Harvard for a day-long workshop on global blogging.
The workshop - little more than a structured brainstorming session - was called "Global Voices Online."
The website you are reading today started out as a blog that Ethan Zuckerman and I set up to organize that workshop.
Our aim, put very simply, was to discuss how "to use blogging and blog tools to help people in different countries hold more meaningful and direct conversations with each other."
The day's discussion was part of a larger Internet and Society conference put on by Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
The Open Society Institute generously granted us some funds to fly in bloggers from various parts of the world.
We publicized the event on the web, and many others - like David - just showed up.
Thank goodness.
Here is an article I wrote soon after the meeting.
Here is Ethan's "day after" blog post.
We did not emerge with a concrete plan for world domination - or even for a coherent project.
Participants agreed to set up a wiki to share information, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for further on-line meetings, and an aggregator of blogs by conference participants and others like them who we began to call "bridge bloggers."
We weren't sure where we would go from there.
One thing, however, was clear: a critical mass of bloggers with similar values was emerging around the globe.
It seemed like a good idea to "connect the dots" (as Jeff Ooi put it) amongst these people and create a platform for this emergent community.
In the weeks following the conference, a number of participants used a wiki to articulate this community's shared values.
The Global Voices Manifesto was the result.
It's worth reproducing in full here because everything Global Voices does today continues to be driven by these fundamental values:
We believe in free speech: in protecting the right to speak — and the right to listen.
We believe in universal access to the tools of speech.
To that end, we seek to enable everyone who wants to speak to have the means to speak — and everyone who wants to hear that speech, the means to listen to it.
Thanks to new tools, speech need no longer be controlled by those who own the means of publishing and distribution, or by governments that would restrict thought and communication.
Now, anyone can wield the power of the press.
Everyone can tell their stories to the world.
We seek to build bridges across the gulfs that divide people, so as to understand each other more fully.
We seek to work together more effectively, and act more powerfully.
We believe in the power of direct connection.
The bond between individuals from different worlds is personal, political and powerful.
We believe conversation across boundaries is essential to a future that is free, fair, prosperous and sustainable - for all citizens of this planet.
While we continue to work and speak as individuals, we also seek to identify and promote our shared interests and goals.
We pledge to respect, assist, teach, learn from, and listen to one other.
We are Global Voices.
We now have an amazing multinational team who act as stewards for various parts of Global Voices.
But the soul of GV are the hundreds of volunteers who take time out from their jobs, studies, and and family obligations to help build a more open and participatory global public discourse.

The detailed story of how Global Voices evolved and how its various branches operate - including Rising Voices, Global Voices Advocacy, and Global Voices Lingua - can be found in many places, including this website's About section and FAQ.
News stories about the project are here.
Since 2004 we've had physical gatherings in London (2005), Delhi (2006), and Budapest (2008).
We are looking forward to another gathering in 2010 (location and date to be announced soon).
In 2006 Ethan and I wrote an article for the Nieman Reports magazine in which we sought to explain the relationship between Global Voices and journalism.
David has another excellent post about why outreach, advocacy and translation are necessary to help people overcome the obstacles to speaking, being heard, and listening to others.
Many people around the world are frustrated that the global English-language mainstream media ignores their country much of the time, or only covers the bad things about their country, or tends to stereotype them.
They see GV as a valuable platform through which to get their stories and viewpoints amplified to a broader global audience.
Others are frustrated that their own domestic news media fail to report on much of the world, do it badly, or do it in a slanted manner that supports their government's worldview, and thus believe that by translating GV content into their local language they can improve their community's understanding of the world.
Others focus on helping communities who are not yet taking advantage of new technologies to get their story out.
Others have joined in common cause against censorship and repression of those who are merely exercising their universal right to free expression according to Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The GV community has not let itself get bogged down in endless debates about whether bloggers are or aren't journalists, or what the Internet means for the news business.
Nor does GV get tangled up in arguments about whether the Internet is or is not going to be a force for global democratization.
As a community we're more interested in rolling up our sleeves and getting to work addressing a more tangible problem: filling a few of the gaping holes in the global public discourse, and doing what we can about the huge imbalances, inequities, and injustices in global media.
However you define this work, we believe that what we're doing has value and makes a difference.
We are grateful that a range of organizations have deemed our work to be worthy of their financial support.
We have developed relationships with news organizations who follow our work and seek us out because - however you define what we do - our community is a valuable source of global information and fresh perspectives.
This is why Reuters provided critical core support in our first three years, and why a many news organizations continue to work with our editors and to contact our volunteers for interviews.
While we can't say we've completely transformed global media, we do believe that we've brought global media attention to a range of stories that might otherwise not have been reported, and provided fresh perspectives on numerous other major international news stories.
That in itself has made the entire enterprise worthwhile.
What's even more exciting is the way in which Global Voices has impacted the lives of our editors, volunteers, and broader community members.
We have become a hub through which an amazing group of talented, articulate, and caring people can find fulfillment, global recognition, and community support.
Click here to read about how Rising Voices has brought more diverse voices into national and global conversations, and what that has meant for the individuals and communities involved.
To get a sense of how amazing our volunteers are, read and listen to some of the blogger profiles posted here.
GV has also had an impact on various blogging communities around the world with whom we have no formal relationship - other than linking to and translating some of their blog posts from time to time.
Just one example: Ethan recently described an eye-opening conversation with a young Kyrgyz blogger, Bektour Iskender about the impact some of our work has had in Central Asia.
What might result from a slightly more democratic, open, and participatory global media environment is not clear.
At the 2004 meeting, Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan expressed the hope that the spread of online citizen media would make societies more democratic and war more difficult for governments to justify.
"Hoder," as he's known on the Internet, has been imprisoned by Ahmedinejad's regime for over a year now, and it's not clear whether expanded contacts between Iranians and Westerners would be a deciding factor in a U.S. decision about whether or not to attack Iran.
Writers like Evgeny Morozov argue that contrary to early optimism about the Internet as a democratizing force, dictatorships are figuring out how to use the Internet to solidify their power and suppress dissent - and that the Internet in many countries is dominated by manipulated spin, disinformation and hate.
Others like Clay Shirky and Patrick Meier argue that there is still reason for optimism.
Still others point out that most of the world's people have more pressing problems - like physical survival - and all of the above including Global Voices' work is irrelevant to them anyway.
Five years ago Ory Okolloh - who went on to found the wildly successful citizen reporting platform Ushahidi - made some comments that are worth revisiting in the context of those debates.
Here's how I reported her words at the time:
Kenyan blogger Ory Okolloh doesn't expect Africa to be transformed by blogging any time soon.
Bridging the digital divide is perhaps the least of Africa's many problems.
Nonetheless, she thinks blogging is important – if not transformative – for the small number of Africans who do blog.
"For young people, we have not been heard, we don't have a space in Africa within politics or in other arenas to express ourselves," Okolloh says.
"I think it could provide a forum for young people to create their own space.
I don't think it will change politics per se or determine an election but I think it can breed community in ways that have not been able to take place before."
Online citizen media is breeding new forms of community at the local, national, and global level.
GV has become a loose connective tissue between Ory's Kenyan blogging community and other bloggers around the world who share similar values.
While Global Voices seeks to influence the stories reported by traditional news media - most of which serve specific nations or regions - we are also building a platform for global discourse, and a community of global citizens around that discourse.
We use the Internet not to escape from our humanity, but to assert it.
We believe individual choices and actions make a difference.
Whether the Internet will ultimately empower more than it enslaves depends on whether we take responsibility for our future and act.
Building a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community focused on specific projects underpinned by a core set of humanistic values is just one small effort in that direction.
The relations between the two neighboring countries, Slovakia and Hungary, went bad last year, especially because of the so-called "language law" introduced in Slovakia.
Hungarian and Slovak people could even see their politicians involving an EU institution, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) into their discussion.
At the end of 2009, Hungarian and Slovak citizens started an online campaign which will turn into more visible formats in January 2010.
A Facebook group called Hungarians and Slovaks (HUN, SLO, ENG) already exists "For the good relations between Hungarians and Slovaks!", and now they're also supporting a new group called Štastný nový rok, Slovensko! / Boldog Új Évet Magyarország!
(SLO, HUN, "Happy New Year, Slovakia!/Happy New Year, Hungary!).
The description of the group — which has its status updates in Slovak and Hungarian — says (HUN, SLO):
Who wants to live in continuous tension with his neighbour?
What's the reason for always looking for the other's faults, and how is it disturbing if someone's always observing our faults?!
The opposition is seemingly becoming more and more serious, and to ease the tension deriving from it we're initiating communication aiming the society, because our conviction is that the tension is mostly generated by actual politics.
We submit that in the judgement of each other, the two countries' civil society can be influenced positively by the courtesy of a bilateral campaign.
The main goal of this campaign is to spread a simple New Year's message in both countries through all channels of communication, and involve NGOs and ordinary citizens in saying Happy New Year to each other.
For this two websites were started for Hungarian and Slovakian supporters: boldogujevetmagyarorszag.sk is the Hungarian site ending with .sk, the Slovak country code, and stastnynovyrokslovensko.hu is for Slovak-speaking people signed with the Hungarian country code.
Also, two videos have recorded for each country:
So far, ReTRo is the only blogger who has commented on the start-up in Hungary by writing a short story (HUN) about neighbours hating each other, but whose relationship starts getting better by a snow bank shoveled away by chance from the hated neighbour's house.
Maybe he wasn't awake yet, or the snow just covered his dislike, or simply he overlooked it, but he didn't notice that he had shoveled the snow not in front of the neighbour's gate, but away from it.
He shrugged it away by thinking this would be the good act for the week.
He explained this to Sanyi, when she simply said he was stupid to work in the place of the hated neighbour.
In the evening when they got home, the snow was freshly swept away from their gate.
The neighbour has thanked him.
It went like this for three days.
They met on Saturday first.
With snow shovels in their hands.
They greeted each other.
They started to chat...
By Monday the snow melted.
Something ended up...
...or has just begun.
Oh, yes and there's a start-up just launched by the name „Boldog Új Évet Magyarország! - Štastný Nový rok, Slovensko!”.
We could start with snow shoveling...

Writing in Arabic, Sudanese blogger Ayman Hajj discusses his country's politics and why many Sudanese people are losing faith in unity.
The actions of the Sudanese government and the southern Sudan Popular Movement, says the blogger, are being seen as a farce: لماذا يظل الشعور متزايدا بأن الحكومة السودانية وشريكها في الحكم الحركة الشعبية لايقومان بشئ غير اداء مسرحية باهتة الملامح امام اعين الشعب السوداني. Why is the feeling increase that the Sudanese government and its partner in governance, the Popular Movement, are not doing anything other than performing a play which is dull, in front of the eyes of the Sudanese people?
“We're sick of Ministry of Culture in Thailand”
This Facebook fan page was created by netizens who are criticizing the methods and policies of Thailand’s Ministry of Culture.
The Ministry has been strict in its promotion and monitoring of authentic Thai culture in old and new media sites.
As of this writing, the page has 2,857 fans.
The Facebook page was also a response to the exaggerated reaction of ministry officials to the discussion thread started by one of its staff workers on popular web portal Pantip.
The intention of the staff was to solicit feedback from the people about the performance of the ministry.
The web forum generated an interesting discussion, including constructive criticism about the work of the ministry.
But ministry officials didn’t like the negative comments.
It forced its own employee to reveal his identity and to issue a public apology.
Sampan Ruksa, the staff of the ministry who initiated the online thread, wrote an apology letter for his actions.
He began by pointing out that he didn’t mean to cause disrespect to the ministry by starting a web discussion on Pantip since it is a popular and credible website
Pantip is a top tier, high quality Thai web board.
The respondents on the web board are members of the site who must submit their national ID card number or show their IP address.
Discussion on this web board is more polite than on other web boards.
Sampan apologized to his superiors and colleagues in the ministry
I, Mr. Samphan Ruksa, started discussion threads at the beginning of last month on the web boards of Pantip.com, Larn Dham Sewana, and MThai.
I contacted the Larn Dham Sewana administrator at the beginning of last month to request the thread be deleted.
I believe that my actions have had no benefit to the Cultural Monitoring Office, and worse, have caused discouragement and unease to the staff members who work therein.
I hereby accept that my actions were due to my ignorance, inexperience, foolishness, and an incomplete understanding of their work process.
In addition, I acted without consulting my superiors, acted beyond my duties, without judgment, and inappropriately, by allowing the outside public to criticize the Office's work too intrusively, to the point of criticizing specific individuals.
Thus, I, as the one who caused the damage, hereby take responsibility, admitting that my actions were unwitting.
I apologize to each staff member of the Cultural Monitoring Office.
I realize that the policies and the work of each staff member benefit our society and nation.
They are determined and diligent, enduring difficulties and fatigue, and are very dedicated to their work.
I am sorely grieved.
Kong Rithdee, in his Bangkok Post blog, lambasted the reactions of the ministry officials
Poor ministry.
They still don't get it that the most important culture is the culture of constructive criticism and free expression.
Commenting on the Facebook page, Natnaree Uriyapongson gives this advice
The Ministry of Culture should do something about the many prostitutes swarming our country instead of turning a blind eye and using it to "help and promote" our economy!!
In Thailand, citizens can call a hotline to complain about images, shows, and events which do not represent Thai culture.
Thai Film Journal reports:
Call 1765.
Thailand’s “culture police force” is composed of 1.3 million volunteers from 4,825 networks across the country who monitor TV shows, websites, and media events that offend and harm Thai culture.
Togo's national football team has been formally disqualified from the African Cup of Nations following Friday's deadly attack on the team's convoy in Cabinda, a region of Angola long troubled by separatist violence.
Members of the Togolese national football team before a warm-up match in Biberach/Riss a few days before the World Cup (Source: Wikipedia)
The team's assistant coach and media officer were killed and goalkeeper Kodjovi "Dodji" Obilale, seriously injured.
Obilale is reported to be in stable condition after undergoing surgery in South Africa, although he is still breathing with the assistance of a respirator.
FLEC, the rebel group which has claimed responsibility for the attack, indicated in a statement that the police envoy, and not the Togolese players, were the target.
The Angolan government, for its part, has called the attack an "isolated incident" and has guaranteed the security of the other teams.
Matches continue as scheduled in Cabinda province.
Although according to news reports, many players had indicated they wanted to keep playing, the Togolese government recalled the team on Saturday.
Togo, which was to play Ghana today, was officially disqualified when the team failed to appear.
Since the attack, many Togolese have been asking difficult questions about what was a preventable tragedy: Why was the team traveling by bus and not by air?
Did the Angolan government choose to stage a matches in Cabinda just to prove the rebellion was over?
Is football worth all the tragedy that seems to follow it?
Should the Cup be canceled?
Play on?
Directly following the attack, there was a big debate online as to whether Togo should withdraw.
Rêve d'Afrique, the blog of Togolese writer Gerry Taama, argued the game should go on:
At 3:34 a.m. local time, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 struck off the coast of the Maule region in Chile.
The earthquake was felt in the capital city of Santiago located 325km from the epicenter.
Extensive damage has been reported throughout the country, and the number of casualties continues to go up.
Throughout the day, aftershocks have also been felt in the region.
A blog Terremoto Chile (Earthquake Chile) was quickly created by Francisco soon after the earthquake hit.
In addition to posting recommendations on what citizens should do following the earthquake , he has been collecting and linking to various Twitpic pictures.

Near the epicenter, Robinson Esparza of the citizen newspaper El aMaule , part of the Diarios Ciudadanos network has been updating a post with the latest regional and national news .
Many comments have been worrying about family members in areas outside the capital, and this lack of communication has continued to be an issue for relatives trying to contact family and friends in places where electricity and phone lines have been affected.

Rodríguez de R. (@micronauta) writes about this frustration:
Just days after American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech on Internet freedom, open source source code repository SourceForge.net blocked access to IP addresses originating in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
SourceForge justifies the move saying they are only following American law.
Which is more or less the same argument Chinese government spokespeople make when questioned about their country's Internet censorship.
SourceForge has been blocked by China before.
Hearing word of this new Great Firewall of America left some Chinese coders wondering if they might now start getting blocked from the other end and what can be done about it.

The Costa Rican Presidential elections are this Sunday and through videos, many Costa Ricans are expressing their concerns regarding the candidates and the future of their country through parody and humor.
First, we have an online video uploaded by El Basureo , where they propose an innovative solution to the age old problem of not knowing whom to vote for.
In this Costa Rican election, out of the 6 candidates running for office, four of them are in the lead: National Liberation's Laura Chinchilla, Libertarian Otto Guevara, Socialdemocrat Otton Solis and Social Christian Luis Fishman.
El Basureo proposes a new machine which will mix and match characteristics of the candidates, and the names that come off those mixes are a wink and nod to the Costarican political situation.
Ethiopia-based bloggers rushed to defend the safety record of the country's national airline on Monday after one of its planes crashed near Beirut, with all 90 people on board feared dead.
Owen Abroad said he was "very upset" by the news in the post Ethiopian Airlines, adding:
Ethiopian Airlines has an outstanding safety record.
The staff are professional, courteous and efficient.
I will be flying from the UK to Addis on Friday on Ethiopian Airlines and, despite today’s tragedy, I am looking forward to it.
A commenter on the blog agreed, writing:
I’ve flown with them a number of times, and never had a bad experience.
They’re also much better with changing dates than most other airline companies.
Two annoyances about the news coverage in the UK
When the crash was first announced on the news, we were told that there were 2 Brits on board, one Canadian citizen, and one French citizen.
Apparently people of other nationalities are less relevant / interesting.
The second:- The airline safety expert was repeatedly questioned about the safety record of African airlines, and had to answer a number of questions about the quality of Ethiopian Airlines’ fleet (in particular the age of the planes).
I certainly don’t remember similar questions being asked after the Air France crash last summer.
Reuters' Addis-based correspondent Barry Malone wrote a post on the company's Africa News Blog titled Ethiopian plane crash should not sully success story:
When news of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash broke this morning my heart sank at the thought of covering yet another negative story about Ethiopia.
It’s particularly galling for Ethiopians that the airline is one of the few international success stories for a country known mostly for famine and war.
When the news emerged I also immediately knew how hard the company’s staff would take it.
I’ve been to the sprawling campus that serves as headquarters to Africa’s arguably flagship airline many times.
The last time was just last week to interview CEO Girma Wake and I left with a gift of Ethiopian coffee and the impression that I’d rarely seen people so passionate or proud about their work and what it does for their country.
Nazret.com provided running updates on the crash as the story developed through the day.
In 2008, during the presidential elections, candidates promised Ghanaians a review of the nation’s constitution.
What made this pledge more appealing was the contenders’ - President John Atta Mills included - intention to involve Ghanaians in the review process.
The president seems to have fulfilled that promise, and new proposals now fuel interesting debates.
In an article posted by Ghana Pundit entitled, “Don’t Extend President’s Tenure, ” Prof. Kofi Quashigah, Dean of the law faculty at the University of Ghana, remarked:
A two four year system is long enough to afford a determined individual as president to impact on the democratic institutions.
A two five year period will be the beginning of creation of tin gods.
It is the strengthening of the institutions of governance that should engage our attention so that the individual does not become the dominant feature…the four year period appears just sufficient so as to avoid the individual staying on too long and becoming complacent.
This comment is a response to one of various constitutional amendment proposals under consideration by Ghana’s Constitutional Review Committee: extending the president’s current four-year term to five.
Quashigah adds:
The status quo should be maintained to avoid creating an aura of indispensability around individuals who become President.
And how is President Atta Mills doing with his promise to involve the people in the review process?
Have Ghanaians even welcomed the idea?
Ghana Pundit reports in a February 11 post :
A legal practitioner has suggested that the review of the constitution should ensure that power resides in the hands of the people through well-structured local institutions and organs and a perfected district assembly system.
The legal practitioner, Nana Addo-Aikens, continues:
The constitutional amendments, which Ghana needs today, should therefore not be the surface-scratching or cosmetic or window-dressing type but must be the type of constitution, which will be all-embracing and sweeping enough in order not to waste a rare opportunity for change.
He then adds:
Functional checks and balances as well as workable forms of separation of powers were other issues that needed serious consideration by the commission.
In a piece about the constitutional amendment on Inter Press Services (IPS) News website , Osabutey Anny quotes legal practitioner and executive secretary of the Commission, Dr. Raymond Atuguba, as saying:
Every single petition before the commission will be carefully examined.
The issues raised are very valid.
Anny reports:
The petitions received to date vary and include calls for a review of the powers of the executive.
According to Anny, Atuguba remarked that,
The number of petitions received by the commission shows the extent to which the public was looking forward to the review.
It is apparent from reports that Ghanaians are more eager to engage in the burgeoning democratic process of the nation since its constitution commenced in 1993.
Anny commends the African nation in his piece:
The country has made much progress since then.
Ghana was ranked the seventh-best country on the continent for good governance according to the 2009 Ibrahim Index of African Governance.
The index measured, among other things, the delivery of public goods and services by government.
Ashanti Regional Minister, Kofi Opoku-Manu, has recently taken great heat for remarks he made during a speech to supporters of the ruling party, National Democratic Congress (NDC) on January 6th.
According to Ghana’s Ato-Kwamena Dadzie, Opoku-Manu “urged party supporters to resort to violence to resolve their differences.”
Dadzie reports in his article, “Opoku-Manu Must Go” with a direct quote from the Regional Minister:
If you can slap him, do so.
Dadzie states:
Comments like these are reckless and irresponsible.
You don’t expect a man in Mr. Opoku-Manu’s position to utter them.
But he did.
Two days later, he had no recollection of what he had said until a recording was played back to him.
That was when he came to his senses, acknowledged his momentous folly and offered an apology, which only came after some big wigs within the government instructed to clear the mess he has created.
Below is Opoku-Manu’s apology as quoted by Dadzie:
I’ll be the last person to advocate for warfare of any type and having listened to this myself, I must say I really feel sorry.
Dadzie interjects with this comment:
But he didn’t stop there.
He offered a veiled defense.
He claims he was speaking in a “charged environment”, implying that he wasn’t using his head.
He was speaking by heart.
You could say he was farting with his mouth.
For opening his mouth too wide to spew such dangerous nonsense, Mr. Opoku-Manu has shown himself to be an irresponsible man who doesn’t deserve to occupy the position he does.
He must be sacked.
And if there is anyone who deserves a hefty slap it is him.
That half-hearted apology he offered only after he had been instructed to do so is not enough.
He must go.
Responses to Opoku-Manu’s comment seem to be mostly in the negative.
David S. left this comment on Dadzie’s blog post:
At a time when Ghana's democracy is in its infancy, the last thing we need is someone encouraging political violence.
Nobody wants this country to become like Zimbabwe or Iran.
He should be made to resign for encouraging people to damage our democracy with political violence.
He is an enemy of democracy.
Banske said this about the same post:
I wonder why people are asking for sacking-sacking doesn't solve the problem.
If Ohene Ntow made this statement, what would have happened?
If Wereko-Brobby, Jake etc made the statement....What would the BNI/National security do?
And people pretend Mills is humane.
Sacking him wouldn't stop the order he gave and similar ones given by the Rawlingses, Vanderpuyes, Anyidohos etc.
Sack him as RM and bring him to the presidency?
This man was the RCC chief director under NPP and that was not enough for him.
If you are born an idiot, you can be 1000years and will still be an idiot that is what OM has confirmed.
Is only the fool we sees political appointment as a permanent job.
Idiocy can be seeing political appointment as a matter of life and death.
By the way Mills is dumb, timid, and powerless and so has not heard/seen anything.
Nana Poku wrote in his article at Modern Ghana, “Opoku-Manu Must go, Apology or Not”:
The more important point is this: how can he assure his political opponents of fairness?
How can they trust him to be an honest broker should any matter of political violence come before him as the Chair of REGSEC?
How does he ensure the safety and security of the very people he wants beaten up?
I believe he's lost the integrity required for a position as Regional Minister.
He must resign or be made to.
We were all witnesses to the many cases of intimidation and harassment of political opponents during and after the 2008 elections.
The last thing we need in this country is for officials, who should know better, to be purveyors of violence and intimidation, themselves.
A press release by the Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy (AAD), an interest group for the progression of Ghana’s democracy, posted by MyJoyOnline stated:
The Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy (AAD) wishes to condemn the Ashanti Regional Minister- Hon. Opoku-Manu for his malicious and distasteful comments made over the weekend; which have the propensity to destabilize the peace and security of this nation.
The Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy (AAD) also views the call by the New Patriotic Party on Hon. Opoku Manu to resign and the subsequent invitation by the appropriate Security agency on the subject matter as most unfortunate and highly hypocritical.
AAD believes that, he who seeks equity must come with clean hands and that the New Patriotic Party's blatant disregard and failure to condemn violent acts of the former Central Regional Minister- Hon. Edumadzie, and the similar comments of Hon. Maxwell Kofi Jumah, Hon. Mike Ocquaye, Dr. Nyaho.
Tamakloe, etc. as morally reprehensible and ultimately negates any good intent to uphold the rule of law and to consolidate peace and security in Ghana.
AAD believes that the apology of the Ashanti Regional Minister is an indication of gross remorse and must be accepted in good faith but we however insist that his averments militates against his status as the Regional Minister and the Chairman of the Regional Security Council.
We therefore hold the strong view that he must honorably resign or the President must find it necessary to remove him from office.
During the 2008 General elections, the President was touted as a man of peace ('asomdwehene') and must therefore be committed in working with public officials and appointees who reflect his character and principles.
Sonia left this comment in response to the AAD press release:
I have monitored the activities of AAD and have come to the conclusion that their sense of objectivity and insight in national issues must be commended by all well meaning Ghanaians.
I wish AFAG and all pressure groups learn from the brains behind AAD.
I believe in the point that he who seeks equity must come with clean hands.
The NPP must be bold to condemn their own else they will never be taken seriously.
A month after a seven-point earthquake destroyed much of southern Haiti, the fate of children, and particularly orphans, has become the main story in many corners.
But Haitian voices on the topic have been few.
In this long video report posted at Telegraph21, recorded in the days immediately following the quake, managers of two Haitian orphanages speak to the issue in two drastically different ways.
At minute 2:30, the manager of an orphanage in an unnamed location in Haiti expresses frustration at the sudden interest in Haitian children, where before there was less concern.
Inquiries from foreign families seeking to adopt have become daily.
"I don't even reply," she says.
"Everybody listen, I don't want to receive post-catastrophe requests."
A counterpart identified as Ledice, however, who cares for sixty children in a different facility, calls for relocating kids faster, and cites a lack of government services to approve adoptions, even those underway before the disaster.
"Now it's a humanitarian cause," she says.
"Let's take the kids.
We'll see the papers later."
Much of the recent focus on kids, both mainstream and not, comes from the widely-publicized case of an American church group arrested last week while trying to bring thirty-three kids from Haiti to the Dominican Republic.
But a broader debate is also underway.
Conducive, a group blog that frequently debates international adoption, notes that previous rushes to adopt children out of crisis went awry:
Removing children during times of disaster is not new.
We saw this with Operation Babylift after the Vietnam War, where the American government hurriedly removed almost 3,000 children from their homeland during the Fall of Saigon in 1975.
Lawsuits between birth parents and adopted parents tied up U.S. courts for years.
Birth parents claimed they never consented to the adoption, and adoptive parents claimed the adoption was legitimate.
Critical adoption theorists are seeing parallels with the current rushed adoption of Haitian children.
In a post titled Orphans, Orphans, Orphans!, ResistRacism is more specific:
How many prospective adoptive parents have been trained in cross cultural and transracial adoption issues?
(The same parent referenced above wonders about black hair care.
Now that she’s receiving the child.
Do you think she thought about other issues of race and culture?)
(Don’t even get me started about trauma issues.
That’s too big to even cover.
But I’m of the opinion that the average individual isn’t equipped to handle extensive trauma in a child.)
Why aren’t agencies soliciting prospective parents of Haitian descent?
Folks with experience treating trauma?
The same post suggests a more creative solution.
Here’s a radical thought: If some of those “orphans” were relinquished for adoption because their parents could not keep them, how about we airlift entire families from Haiti to the U.S.?
If you’re seriously talking about the welfare of the child, isn’t it best for the family to remain together?
But that wouldn’t serve the needs of those other families.
You know, those good families who wish to save the orphans.
Renewed attention to Haiti's Restavec (sometimes Restavek) system has also become an issue.
In a post from before the quake, Repeating Islands says the system, "through which parents unable to support their children send them to live with more affluent relatives or strangers for whom they receive food, shelter and education in return for work" has become tantamount to slavery.
She quotes a United Nations investigator who visited Haiti last year to investigate the Restivek issue, saying
...Although placement with children with other family members has long been a practice in Haiti, nowadays 'paid recruiters scour the country looking for children to traffic both within and outside Haiti.
This practice is a severe violation of the most fundamental rights of the child.'
Most international agencies involved in crisis childcare have, in the past two weeks, stated opposition to rapid adoptions in Haiti.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, in a statement presented as an interview with one of its child protection officers, said it believed efforts to connect children with family members in Haiti should receive priority, and adoption a last resort.
...In situations where a child is evacuated, there are clear procedures to follow: the child should be accompanied by a relative or someone who knows them, if possible; the details of the child must be registered and their family must know where the child is taken to and by whom.
Unfortunately some children were evacuated in haste without all their details being recorded.
Aid groups including Save the Children, World Vision and the Red Cross Disaster Fund (which is separate from the International Committee), issued a joint statement also opposing evacuations and adoptions.
So did UNICEF.
So what's the controversy?
The case of the children stopped at the border involved a Protestant church adoption group, some of which have advocated international adoption as a means of spreading their own religious views.
Other evangelist Christian blogs are more careful.
Christianity Today, "A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction" opposed quick international adoptions:
In the initial months after an incident like this, we don't want to move children away from the area where family members are searching for them.
After the Southeast Asian tsunami in 2004, there were many small kids virtually unidentifiable, and yet a very high percentage of those children, thanks to DNA testing and other methods, were eventually returned to family members.
With phone lines being restored in Haiti, money sent from families abroad "by wire" is again arriving, and helping reconstruction even where international aid has not arrived.
Remittances from family members living abroad represented at least thirty percent of Haiti's Gross National Product before the January 12 earthquake.
The two largest Haitian communities outside Haiti are those in the Dominican Republic and the United States.
Between 400 thousand and 600 thousand Haitian citizens call each of the neighboring nations home.
Another 80-100 thousand live in other Caribbean nations or in France.
This chart from the Inter-American Development bank, based on a 2006 study, claims that Haitians living in the United States sent nearly $1.9 billion home annually.
The collapse of telephone service and, in some cases the buildings that housed banks and remittance offices, had temporarily cut off that money.
But this week long lines were visible outside money transfer offices, such as this CAM office in Carrefour, southeast of Port au Prince, photographed by GV's Georgia Poppelwell.
Though the capital has received the bulk of media attention, it's not necessarily where the money sent by family members abroad will arrive.
The International Association of Money Transfer Networks, an industry association which represents companies that carry electronic money transfers, says that about half the funds wired to Haiti from the US, the largest source of remittances, is sent to rural areas.
That's significant because those areas are also seeing an increase in population, as people displaced by the quake go to live with family and friends in hometowns and less-damaged areas.
Dilip Ratha, a World Bank economist, argues at the bank's blog that remittances could hold a more important role with the emergency extension of "temporary protected" immigration status ("TPS) to as many as 200 thousand Haitians living in the US.
If the TPS resulted in a 20 percent increase in the average remittance per migrant, we would expect an additional $360 million remittance flows to Haiti in 2010!
What is more, if the TPS were to be extended once beyond the currently stipulated 18 months – the extension is almost certain to happen, judging by the history of extensions of the TPS for El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia and Sudan – additional fund flows to Haiti would exceed a billion dollar over three years.
That would be a billion dollar of financial help coupled with goodwill and advice, tailored to the needs of the recipient.
Financial help in the form of remittances from family members abroad is always the first to arrive in times of distress.
Remittances to Haiti this year will surge, as they have done whenever and wherever there has been a crisis or natural disaster

At around 7:30 pm on Saturday (February 13, 2010) a bomb blast at a restaurant popular with tourists in India's western city of Pune killed 9 people and left 57 people injured.
The bomb was in a backpack and it exploded when an waiter tried to inspect the left luggage.
Shashi Bellamkonda at My Digital Thoughts reports:
A few hours ago (Feb 13th 2010) a bomb went off popular cafe ‘German Bakery” in Pune India.
At the time of posting this the press were reporting that 8 people had died and about 40 injured in this blast which left the bodies charred beyond recognition.
The bakery is a popular spot with foreign tourists.
Shashi has also these observations:
The blast area is near the Osho Ashram frequented by tourists another similarity to the Mumbai 2008 blasts.
Pragmatic Euphony warns:
The jehadis have struck again on the Indian mainland; this time in Pune, albeit more than a year after the horrendous terror attacks on Mumbai in November 2008.
The initial response, while going with the most plausible and popular assumption that the blast was the handiwork of Pakistan based jehadi groups, is one of indignation.
Perhaps understandably so as tempers are bound to run high.
And this emotion is likely to be further amplified as the Indian mainstream media hyperventilates and virtually runs amok with its over the top coverage of the incident.
People are already finding links to Pakistan.
Offstumped informs that the Pune blast followed a Laskar-e-Taiba threat.
A top leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba named Pune as a target city at a permitted public rally in Pakistan.
The Acorn says:
Despite the Lashkar-e-Taiba threat, it is too early to definitively attribute the attack to the Pakistani military-jihadi complex.
But it is clear that the Pakistani military-jihadi complex has every reason to escalate tensions with India through the use of terrorism.
Without the excuse of “tensions to the east”, Pakistan would have nothing left to explain to Washington its double-dealing on the taliban.
Dilip D'Souza at Death Ends Fun reminds that India should also do something about the homegrown terror:
The Twittersphere was abuzz with tweets and retweets spreading the news.
Here are some of the reactions:
IndiaHappening: Nine killed, 32 hurt in Pune terror blast http://bit.ly/arLssZ #India
r_shekhawat: Terror strikes at my home - 'Pune' : Once again, innocent people killed by some mindless terrorists.
Pune, a great city, hurt and bruised.
pragmatic_rebel: Must be a sad start to Valentine's day in #Pune!
Still aghast at the blasts, I wish #India does something really different this time.
bhuvan_chelsea: We need a vigilante like Batman here in #India . ;-)
tweetSAMRAT: Is praying for the victims of the recent Pune bomb blast.
nehasasi: RT @deepitganjoo: Please RT This Jahangir Hospital Pune Needs Blood AB+ve and B+ve Contact : 1066 Those who are in Pune.... Please _india_: Pune blast casts shadow on talks with Pak
No doubt the blast in Pune will impact the recent goodwill talks between India and Pakistan.
But it seems that the terrorists are being given the upper hand as emotions are running high everywhere.
A two-day event which began yesterday; is being organized by the Danquah Institute (DI), a policy think tank, research and analysis centre, to create a national platform for stakeholders to lead the discussion on the possibility of facilitating the adoption of biometric voter registration, and subsequently the e-voting system in Ghana.
The Danquah Institute has hailed the successful conclusion of electronic voting in the world's largest democracy and called on Ghana's Electoral Commission to consider the numerous benefits of electronic voting as demonstrated in this latest poll.
According to Honorable Haruna Iddrisu, Minister of Communication,
even though the implementation of both the biometric voter registration which is been handled by the National Identification Authority and e-Voting were practicable in the long term, they could not be introduced anytime soon”.
He also added:
"All political parties have endorsed biometric registration, which is prelude to e-voting and what we are doing here today will help to shape our electoral process in the future, but we do not have the requisite infrastructure for a speedy implementation of the all important projects in the short term”.
Therefore, government should still research more into its implementation by 2016 and not 2012.
Musah Yahaya Jafaru from Graphic Ghana also reported on this event and had this to say;
The Chairman of the Electoral Commission (EC); Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan stated; "If the government wouldn't educate the masses including his aged mother in the village about the benefits of e-Voting and how to use it, he wouldn't go in for it".
He also stressed;
Until we make the people comfortable with the use of the computer, we cannot go e-voting”.
Dr Afari-Gyan said even developed countries such as Britain, Canada and Australia had not subscribed to e-voting and wondered why Nigeria and Kenya wanted to go e-voting.
He cited the increasing use of money by politicians to seek public office, the exaggerated importance of political parties, the involvement of the youth in election violence, strange campaign promises and the use of the media to fuel violence as some of the worrying trends in the country’s elections.
He said increasingly people were seeking public office not as a means to serve their people but primarily as a short-cut to fame, influence and wealth.
In a Press Statement by the Danquah Institute titled: Ghana’s Democracy Is Not There Yet, E-Voting May Get Us There.
Hayford from Sydney, Australia commented:
"I feel proud as a Ghanaian that the country has people with such a great level of understanding.
I perfectly agree with the above suggestions.
If indeed our Electoral Commission really wants a more reliable and credible system of voting in Ghana, then I think the commission should have spearheaded the ideas highlighted above.
I want to beg the electoral commission not to down play on the E-voting system but should throw all its weight behind this system.
Our women, children and the poor deserve to be spared the fear, anxiety and brutalities associated with the current system the gives room for Kenyan-like situations."
In my candid opinion and experience working with the National Identification Authority currently registering masses for the creating of a database of all Ghanaians, I support the advice of the current Electoral Commissioner on this subject.
My question is; Is Ghana really ready for e-Voting?

“I want all other children born in Liberia- and the world- to lead full lives free of pain and filled with the blossoms of love, like mine,” writes Mahmud Johnson at the blog for the youth-oriented HIV/AIDS group Global 40 Forum.
He is an 18-year old former co-host of the Liberian youth radio show, "Let’s Talk About Sex", which deals with issues relating to the spread of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention.
Liberia is gradually transitioning from the nearly 15 years of intermittent civil war that ended in 2003 and moving towards mainstream development.
The barriers that remain are great.
Nearly 250,000 people were killed during the war, and several hundred thousand were exiled in neighboring countries or in Europe or the United States.
The effects of war on youth
The effects of the war on children are well documented.
When the fighting began, different military groups searched for soldiers in the ranks of children.
Perhaps as many as 20,000 children, some as young as 6-years-old, were recruited, often forcibly.
“They were forced to kill friends and family members including their parents, rape and be raped, serve as sexual slaves and prostitutes, labor, take drugs, engage in cannibalism, torture and pillage communities,” says the report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia.
Women and girls also suffered greatly.
Liberia’s TRC received nearly 7,000 reported cases of sexual violence.
Girls and women aged 15–19 make a majority of those reported cases.
Despite seven years of peace, bad news can still cascade out of Liberia like a waterfall.
Three out of four Liberians live on less than one dollar a day; only half the country's children attend school; Fifty percent of households in the capital Monrovia are classified as food secure.
The economic prognosis remains bleak and repatriating young people – some of them former child soldiers – into the economy continues to cause the government problems.
This can be especially troubling because half of Liberia’s population is under 20.
On the Ceasefire Liberia blog, a Rising Voices project, Stephen R. Johnson writes:
Liberia’s youth face many challenges in gaining an education that delivers them the right set of skills and knowledge to become productive in today’s labor market.
As a result, the transition from school to work is more often than not unsuccessful and youth end up either unemployed or underemployed in the rural, suburban and urban informal sectors.
Yet, the country and its people are determined to put the past behind them.
The country’s economy has been growing and the government is modernizing its infrastructure.
Groups like the YMCA have been training ex-combatants for employment or to start their own businesses.
Poverty and tough decisions
However, the continuing economic problems have created a ripple effect in other areas.
Poverty has forced many women into making difficult and dangerous decisions regarding their sex life, says Jerry B. Tarbolo Jr, from the Federation of Liberian Youth.
He said this combination has helped intensify the HIV/AIDS transmission rate in Liberia’s urban areas.
If this continues, the disease will mainly affect the younger generation, he says, which is one of Liberia’s great resources.
The connection between economic survival and sexual violence has a legacy in Liberia.
A 2008 UNFPA study of women in Liberia’s Lofa County found that during the war, nine out of ten women had lost their livelihoods, 96 percent had lost shelter and nearly 75 percent had lost a relative.
More than half of the women were victims of sexual violence, and of those women, half of them reported providing sex for some form of favors.
Misconceptions of HIV/AIDS
Pauline Wleh, a nurse counselor at a Monrovia-based YMCA Youth Centre, says one thing young Liberians today need is education regarding sexual health.
She spoke to a writer for Merlin, an international NGO that builds health services in fragile states.
“Years of conflict here disrupted our formal schooling system and broke up health services so that youths today know very little about HIV and AIDS.
Because of the lack of knowledge, there is a lot of stigma and misconceptions surrounding AIDS now.
Youths are too scared to talk to their parents and there is a lack of accessible information.
But they can discretely drop in on me between basketball games or after a trip to the computer lab to ask questions, access services and get advice.”
She says some changes in attitudes have become apparent.
“In the two years since the centre opened, I have seen thousands of young people but only given 291 HIV tests.
Although people are keen to talk to me, they are rarely convinced to take an HIV test because they are scared.”
The majority who opt out of the testing, claim they will ‘come back later,’ or more honestly ‘don’t want to know my status, because I don’t want to worry.’
The fight for awareness
This social avoidance is what programs like "Let’s Talk About Sex" are designed to educate against.
The weekly 30-minute show, funded in part by UNFPA, provides listeners with 30 minutes of information and conversation about sex and reproductive health issues, all tailored toward young people.
Each program is researched and written by the four young hosts, who control all the programming, including research, writing and performing each episode.
“My work as co-host of the LTAS show gave me a working knowledge on the actual realities faced by my fellow Liberian youth in the fight against HIV," Mahmud Johnson writes.
He says you can’t separate Liberia’s economic problems from issues regarding sexual health.
As the show’s outreach team usually traveled to leeward communities and villages to teach the youth there about HIV, I became aware, first hand, of the economic and traditional issues many people are faced with, and how those issues contribute to the spread of HIV in Liberia.
I also became aware of some bizarre myths young people harbor on HIV spread and treatment.
A very huge percentage of the youth population in Liberia has practically no knowledge about the transmission and prevention of HIV, and this phenomenon is due in no small part to the country’s spiralling illiteracy rate.
Even the youth who go to school have minimal information about HIV, as such reproductive health issues are not taught in Liberian schools.
Hence, many myths abound amongst Liberian youth about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, prominent amongst which is the myth that smoking pot prevents HIV infection.
Because of these potentially dangerous myths, the radio show’s team developed a ‘Myths vs. Reality’ segment, in which (in colloquial Liberian language) we addressed several of those myths on a weekly basis.
The show offers a useful medium for young people to learn about the virus.
And, of course, talk about sex.
Today, the LTAS radio show is aired all over Liberia, and uses other reinforcement channels such as brochures, dramas, road shows, focus groups discussions, and peer training to spread the message about HIV transmission and pregnancy prevention.
The show is so popular that the Liberian populace have even used the show to coin a joke in response to the recent shortage of chicken eggs on the Liberian market: chickens in Liberia now listen to ‘Let’s Talk About Sex!’ and practice safe sex!
I am aware of the reality that not every single youth in Liberia will heed the health messages disseminated on the show.
But even if one person’s life is changed in the process, that would a phenomenal success for me as a pioneer host on the LTAS show.

Ever visited Lebanon's online English paper, The Daily Star?
According to popular blogger, Qifa Nabki, it is:
...one of the worst websites I’ve ever seen.
It is slow, clunky, and hideously ugly.
Another blogger, Richard Hall, describes The Daily Star's website:
...as easy to navigate as a 1920’s Russian steam boat.
The Daily Star, Lebanon's only English paper, has been providing online news from Beirut for over a decade.
Since its launch online, the paper has refused to upgrade its website, frustrating many of its readers.
The "ugly" Daily Star has prompted Lebanese bloggers to act, with an online campaign launched by creator of the Beirut Spring blog, Mustapha.
Mustapha has cleverly created a mock Daily Star website - the Better Daily Star Project or #BDSP on Twitter - using WordPress functionality to highlight the incompetence of The Daily Star's IT and web design team.
Although his actions might raise eyebrows at The Daily Star, Mustapha insists his intentions are positive:
-The aim of #BDSP is not to steal away viewers from The Daily Star's website.
It's to regain back readers who have left them in frustration.
In fact, the DS should pay us to do this :)
-This project is not meant in any way to hurt the reputation of the Daily Star.
The point of this project is to try to steer the Daily Star's website away from what we believe is the wrong course
-When the Daily Star finally puts a better website in place, this project will no longer have to exist.
Our mission will be done.
In fact, we will turn into their biggest cheerleaders
- We completely respect intellectual property rights.
We never pretend that we own this stuff or that we wrote the articles, this is why this project strives to make the correct attributions to each and every article
Why am I doing it.
What's the point?
Well, I am trying to say this: If one guy (yours humbly) can use freely available opensource software (wordpress if you must know) to create this alternative, arguably better website in two weeks, why can't a newspaper with an actual IT department do it?
In other words, I'm shooting down the argument that it would be too expensive to do.
Listen to me well: They're just being lazy.
But isn't this Illegal?
Probably.
But I'm not making any money out of it (in fact, I'm paying some in effort and hosting fees), and I promise that as soon as they do something about their site, I'll gladly bow out.
Besides, it will cost them more to sue me than to actually fix their site and let me off their back.
Mustapha's initative indeed caught the eye of the mainly supportive Lebanese blogosphere.
Rami at +961 added a few words of support on his blog:
What to do when you’re just fed up waiting for something to happen?
Best thing is to take matters into your own hands!
And that’s what fellow blogger Mustapha did while waiting for the Daily Star IT people to renovate their website.
As did Tajaddod Youth:
While we’re on the subject of dysfunctional websites, after many years of anglophone frustration with the Daily Star’s website, one bloggerhas decided to act.
The result, not just a critique of Lebanon’s only english language newspaper’s poor excuse for a website, but a completely redesigned homepage for the newspaper we all love.
Supportive comments for the #BDSP poured on Qifa Nabki's blog post on the subject:
Blackstar Says:
wow.
I feel I can breathe!
I positively HATE the Daily Star website as it is now (does it sound strange that reading it makes me claustrophobic?)
sean Says: A huge improvement.
The real site is absolutely terrible.
It looks like a spammy ad-infested blogspot site, or worse.
Many Daily Star readers will be hoping that the #BDSP campaign will prompt a change at The Daily Star, turning the "1920's Russian steam boat" into a 21st century cruise liner.

Lebanon: The Better Daily Star Project
Two weeks ago, some female college students in Malaysia announced the “pantyless movement” on Valentine’s Day.
The goal of the “no-panties promotion” is to show how women love their boyfriends.
The campaign became quite popular through word of mouth and the internet.
lurveangel is against the campaign:
Not very highly-educated aren't they?
If they are, they should know that not wearing your panties doesn't prove a true love okay?
Just lust~ Of course it's kinky when you know your other half is not wearing anything underneath, but why make it public??
What's wrong with these people??!!
True love is SO not about whether one is covered up every single inch or bare naked when she's with her partner.
People who confuse this are definitely someone who never been in love, or be loved.
Or even know the meaning of "true love".
The Selangor Islamic Affairs Department (JAIS) and other public moral authorities are very mad.
They promise to hunt those who will join the pantyless movement because celebrating Valentine’s Day is a deviation of Islamic teaching.
Ms Daffodil accuses authorities of overreacting to the issue:
OK…..granted it’s pretty silly to be going panty-less just to show your love for someone……..and whoever thought of such crap is probably some sex-starved amphibian hiding behind some bushes at some escalator armed with a hand-mirror or camera phone…… . But for our country’s moral police to go jumping mad and issuing warnings about the evils of Valentine’s Day!!!???
Talk about “over-reacting” man……I mean, think about it for a minute here……if they wanted to, they can go panty-less any other day right?
Josh insists that not wearing panties should not pose a problem to others
Let me ask you one question, how does someone not wearing their underwear affect you as a person.
Would you even realise it?
Would you even know?
How do you know that the very people you met on the street today actually have their underwears on?
So why the fuss when chances are you would not even realise if a person has their underwear on and thus would not be affected by it.
This is a non-issue to begin with.
What people wear under their clothes is their own business and none of ours.
Mumsie wonders how authorities will identify pantyless college students.
Will they raise the skirt of students?
Gosh, this is something really new and I wonder how on earth is JAIS going to prevent that from happening?!..Are they going to hunt these “panty-less” students by peeping under each and every skirt?!!
That would be a glaring sex offence, wouldn’t it?
I can imagine every male student on that day will be betting and guessing which female student is not wearing underpants! ...;-)
The Other Malaysia recognizes the uniqueness of the protest/event:
1
The organisation of this ‘event’ was spontaneous and organic, not being instigated by any political party or popular politician;
2
The mode of organisation of the event was done via word-of-mouth and internet, pointing to the growing importance of the internet, sms-es and other forms of communication infrastructure that were put in place as part of Malaysia’s rapid development to a semi-industrialised economy; 3.
The nature of the celebration/protest however remains non-political and primarily personal, as it is meant to serve as a demonstration of love for one’s partners.
Is the pantyless movement a form of ‘passive resistance’?
…it may be a passive resistance against a state religious bureaucracy whose role in the moral policing of society has become well known and notorious.
(Note that this remains a hypothesis on our part)
A mural of Mamadou Tandja hanging in the office of President (Photo by Jacob Silberberg for Panos Pictures)
On Thursday, February 18th a coup took place in Niger in which President Mamadou Tandja was captured after a gun battle in the capital, Niamey, led by led by Col. Abdoulaye Adamou Harouna (who was was the former aide-de-camp of Niger's previous coup leader Maj. Daouda Mallam Wanke).
In a quite unpoplar move, a few months ago Tandja illegally changed the constitution to allow him a third term in what was generally considered a mass fraud referendum (see Jen Brea's roundup on the reactions caused by that decision).
For a few hours, confusion reigned about what was going on.
Raffaella Toticchi in Niamey wrote on Thursday afternoon :
First, about 7.8 million (3/5) of Niger's citizens experience severe or moderate food insecurity.
Mass starvation is never a stabilizing force. Second, and more importantly, President Tandja had angered many Nigeriens in 2009 when he dissolved parliament and enacted constitutional reforms that gave him broad powers with few checks or balances.
Tandja was constitutionally required to step down from office in December, as that was the end of his second five-year term in office, but the changes he made to the constitution allowed him to stay in office for three more years.
These moves were extremely unpopular; 10,000 protesters came out on Sunday to dispute Tandja's actions.
Clearly, this coup is the result of the ongoing political crisis.
As put by Nigerien commenter Ali Dan-Bouzoua in a discussion list about internet in Niger, unfortuntely there hasn't been much citizen media covering the event:
This is what happens when civilian and civil institutions are too weak, too cowardly, too much "talk-talk-only," to defend their own freedom from usurping so-called leaders.
This describes Nigeria perfectly: so, Nigeria is next in the coup movement: it is only logical and ripe.
Toyin Ade:
If there should be any coup at all in Nigeria, it should be targetted at those useless clowns calling themselves Yar'Adua's kitchen/toilet cabinet that have arrogated to themselves what they don't have.
Daniel Hongramngaye from Chad, also draws a parallel between Niger and his own country at the blog Makaïla :
While bleeding on the wedding night is still the proof of the bride's honor in Egypt and Middle Eastern countries, Radio Netherlands broadcast an Arabic translation of the Chinese advertisement of the Artificial Virginity Hymen kit.
Youm7 newspaper announced that the product will be available on the Egyptian market for LE 83.
And as if Egyptian women were all waiting for the miracle hymen to embark on pre-marital sex, conservative parliament members want the product banned and any importer exiled or beheaded.
Egyptians began wondering if Egypt will start importing Chinese Hymens and Amira Al Tahawi, who used to work with Radio Netherlands at the time, got fired for blowing the whistle over the fabricated Chinese hymen story.
On her blog Amira Al Tahawi wrote: Yes!
I was fired over a blog post I published last December!
On 26 January, 2010, I received a termination letter putting an end to my job as a Cairo correspondent for Radio Netherlands.
In my post I proved that that station published false unverified information on 22 August, 2009, regarding the penetration of the Chinese "Artificial Hymen" in the Arab world.
The information broadcast on the Radio said that the fake hymen is manufactured specially for Arab and Muslim women ignoring the fact that the product has been available in Japan since 1993 and it was not specially produced by the Chinese who realized the schizophrenic condition of Arab women who need to fake their virginity.
I asked the station to correct the factual errors with that piece of fabricated news in an email dated 14 September.
My request fell on deaf ears and many Egyptian news portals further spread the lie without bothering to investigate the facts or the sources quoted.
Many bloggers found the decision to fire her ridiculous and unjustified; Nawara Negm wondered: عايزين نصيح لها بقى يا شباب Why are they firing her?
She did not write anything offensive about Radio Netherlands.
Anyway, She is suing them ... let's give her a hand guys!
Eman Hashim is lamenting the integrity of journalism; she wrote: و كل ده عشان قالت لأة
Amira got fired and is being denied her financial and moral rights because she said NO!
Amira wrote the details on her blog so let's give her a louder voice and let everyone know the truth.
We blame the silent for their silence but we owe those who have a voice a microphone.
Is that how Radio Netherlands deal with false news?
Where is their integrity?
Where is their respect to their readers and listeners?
They could have easily published a correction or anything ... anything at all.
The fact that they did not publish a clarification or a verification of any sort is sad but firing an honest journalist for exposing fallacies is a practical joke.
Dr. Mostafa El Nagaar wrote in Amira's defense saying: Amira is now suffering the dire consequences of her professionalism and nobility.
She is paying the high price for ethical journalism.
She needs someone to defend her the way she defended Egyptian girls when imposters claimed that they are waiting for the fake hymen to cover up for their immorality.
I urge every Egyptian woman to return the favor and defend Amira who lost her job.
I am asking all Women's Rights organizations to show their solidarity with Amira.
We officially ask for a clear apology from those who tarnished our reputation and I am asking all those who speak in the name of honor to show their support.
Mostafa Fathi also posted a note on Facebook and Karim El Beheiry published a post on his blog in solidarity with Amira.
In October 2009, Mohamed Al Rahal ordered a hymen kit and posted photos in his blog, as noted in a previous Global Voices story.
The Egyptian football team beat Ghana in the African Cup of Nations' final match, and achieved its third consecutive championship.
This is also Egypt's seventh championship since the launch of the tournament in the 50's.
Bloggers join the rest of the country in celebrating the achievement.
Zeinobia wrote here about the Egyptian victory saying: We played a good game against Ghana, and at the end fate made Gedo the reason of making nearly 80 million Egyptian happy around the globe, uniting them in a very rare occasion regardless of its psychological meaning or political meaning or whatever.
Coach Hassan Shehata is insisting to become one of the best coaches not only in Egypt's football history but also in Africa's football history.
This man managed to make something great from our national team for real.
His discovery Mohamed Nagi aka Gedo. Ahmed Hassan was fantastic.
All of the players were great.
The victory wasn't only celebrated here in Egypt.
In Qatar, Qatar Living wrote here about the victory, and the expected sleepless night in Doha: Egypt beats Ghana 1-0 to earn African Cup title..
Mod Note : It's going to be a noisy night in Doha!
Congratulations to all the Egyptians in Qatar!
An Egyptian blogger living in USA, Egyptian Wish, wrote a new post here saying: Dear Egyptians,
Congratulations for CAN2010!
Egyptian-in-USA
Also in Palestine, Hamas didn't miss the opportunity, and congratulated the Egyptians on their seventh Championship.
Kelmety wrote about it here: Hamas has congratulated the Egyptian president, government, and people on their winning their seventh African Cup of Nations, and their third consecutive championship.
Zeinobia wrote another post here, about the Egyptian president's sons, who went to Angola to support the Egyptian football team: I believe that the photos of the Mubarak brothers should have its own post.
As I hinted before the brothers went to Angola to watch the final match between Egypt and Ghana.
Some people will see it as political publicity stunt , others knowing how crazy the brothers about football.
Another blogger, My Oblivia, had a different point of view here: Therefore, will someone please bother explaining how can one lousy tournament make us cheer for the same country where this happens…
In this country people die of hunger, they die of torture, they simply die because they don’t have half the basic humane standards of living and medical attention, let alone awareness…
So God did not want us to win our daily battles of mere survival, instead, He destined us for winning a soccer game, and entire tournament, hallelujah, we’re saved!
So, this is our destined victory, in soccer…
And now, all out other problems are solved and we are eternally blessed!
And finally, the Egyptian national team usually adds a new star on their jersey every time they win the African Cup of Nations.
But there is one problem here: where will we put all those stars on our national team's jerseys now that we have won our seventh championship.
Yar'Adua's absence created a leadership vacuum which frustrated many Nigerians, particularly in the wake of crises such as Umar Abdulmutallab's attempted terror attract and the religious conflict in the central Nigerian city of Jos.
Many Nigerians called for Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan to step into Yar'Adua's shoes, but the situation was complex: As a southerner, Jonathan's assumption of the Presidency would threaten to destabilize the delicate power-sharing arrangement between Northern and Southern Nigeria.
Further, without written instructions from the President himself, the legal extent of Jonathan's position were unclear.
For more than two months Nigerian bloggers lamented the leadership void.
Chinedu Vincent Akuta at Briefs from Akuta wrote:
Enough of power vacuum, near constitutional crisis, and over heating of the polity all due to the fact that the ruling party (PDP) does not trust the Vice President (Jonathan Goodluck) to formally act as President until President Yar’Adua recovers from his illness.
There is no choice other than to respect the wishes of the Nigerian people, power belongs to the people.
And indeed, many Nigerians shared his sentiments.
During the month of January frustrated Nigerians marched in Lagos, Abuja, and London.
Adeolu Akinyemi wrote on why he marched:
We are not happy with a Plane load of 300 people dying in the streets of Jos in Religious wars because of inaction from a missing leader.
Enough is Enough!
We will not accept the label of terrorism bestowed on us by the 58 days inactivity of our president’s mobile phone.
Enough is Enough!
Leadership Vacuum is dangerous and is responsible for killings in the north, kidnapping in the east, Militants gang raping in the South South and intellectual indifference in the west.
Enough is Enough!
Yusef, a commenter on Akinyemi's blog, was more skeptical (edited from the original English version):
How many times will I read this celebrated line "Enough is Enough"?????
It's very strange how we display so much hypocrisy when faced with some adversity and yet are able to make very sharp u-turns once the weather is stormed.
If I call on anyone to do what will be absolutely necessary to get our system working, how will I be 100% sure that being a northerner, he will not change his mind once he gets some sense spoken to him by his kinsman... Or being a Muslim and he being of another faith, wont see me in the deep recesses of his heart, as being an enemy.
There is no such thing as "Enough is Enough" Deolu.
We do not know what a nation is yet, not to even talk of kinsmanship.
It's not enough to brandish posters of Ernesto Che on our walls to pretend to imagine or understand what it takes to lay down ABSOLUTELY everything for a better day.
We do not know this adversity . . . or we are too selfish hoping that "one day e go better for our side"! ! ! !
Our so-called leaders did not drop from Hell, but are actually just a reflection of our society.
Replace with even yourself and you will be surprised at what you will do or become.
Popular broadcast journalist Funmi Ayanda also wrote about her frustration with the prevalence passive hand-wringing:
I have sat in the company of bank MDs who stole billions of money, ruling party leaders who manipulate the electoral process and steal billions on naira, pastors of un taxed mega churches where all the above pay staggering sums in tithes and contribution and listened in disbelief as they all moan about bad leadership and the Nigerian situation.
I have often mentally checked my teeth for visible spinach; perhaps the joke is on me?
So make l for no crase finish l ask simple questions like, “so what do you think we should do” what is within our own control immediately and how do we build on that?
“What will my role be in that”?
Usually, the conversation goes no further because l sometimes think both Nigerians and foreigners have a morbid fascination with Nigeria’s undeniable failures.
On February 9th, after weeks of political wrangling, the Senate confirmed Jonathan as acting President.
Many in the blogosphere saw the event as cause for celebration.
Solomonsydelle of Nigerian Curiosity provided an excellent analysis of the situation as it unfolded (See here for her coverage).
She wrote:
February 9th could possibly go down in history as a day when democratic political measures where used to take Nigeria one step further down the path to becoming a true democratic nation.
Akin, too, was guardedly hopeful:
Maybe and just maybe, we might just have a good President and the good luck in his name brings good fortune to Nigeria, maybe, we can hope, maybe, we can dream, maybe, we can expect, maybe, we can realise – A New Nigeria.
But others saw reason for concern, pointing out that although Jonathan's assumption of power might be a political necessity, it was not explicitly permitted by the Nigerian Constitution.
Max Siollun summed up the predicament as follows:
Jonathan’s confirmation as VP will hopefully put an end to the controversy (at least temporarily), and will give the leadership some semblance of order and due process.
While we have arrived at a PRACTICAL solution, I am not sure that the manner and circumstances in which Jonathan was appointed acting VP was LEGAL.
Jide Salu acknowledged the constitutional ambiguity, but was primarily thankful that the country finally has a leader.
I just want some peace and direction.
If you were residing in the country, you would understand better.
Nigeria was not only headless, it was directionless with all the looting that has gone on and still going.
Which for now is under wraps.
Ana Nimmos was optimistic, but also saw cause for concern:
may not be the actual end of this logjam as it presents its own challenges.
For instance, by this resolution - if we accept it for arguments sake - Nigeria now has two Presidents -though one is acting.
Yar'adua never left power and Goodluck should be very careful what actions he takes.
Loomnie also highlighted unanswered questions for the future:
One also has to think about the machine that was ruling the country all the while Yar’Adua was not available.
Is the new President Goodluck Jonathan going to be able to take charge of the machine?
Is he going to be deferring to it/them?
Those are going to be crucial questions in the next few months.
This week we will take a random walk around different blogs, and different topics in a maze that is little different than the random markets of Aleppo.
We leave Hanzala to ponder the derelict state of Syria's public sector and his decision to quit, and we move to a little more joyful topic. As with every Friday, the blogosphere was blessed with the new installment of Abufares and Mariyah's Sea Side collaborative story. In Part 29, you'll read:
Yasmina sat down on the couch behind me.
Obviously she had seen way beyond the sexy smile.”Oh, Houssam.
Oh god, Houssam.”
She couldn’t hold back her tears and as she cried her heart out again, I knew that I couldn’t let her down.
I would just have to hope that Youssef would forgive me…someday.
“We’ll go in the morning, Yasmina.
I’ll be here early.
Ok?”
I said as soothingly as I could.
And on the topic of love and Valentines, Untold Damascene Stories, the blog of FW Magazine, publishes a report about the commercialization of Valentine's Day on the streets of Damascus:
For Syrians, who also aren’t safe from the hands of commercialism, the rituals of valentine start a month before Feb the 14th.
Guys start calling their friends to ask for money; No “man” wants to be caught penniless in front of their girl friends on Valentine’s.
Restaurants start preparations with decorations and special offers “For Families Only,” “No single men allowed.” 50 liras red roses magically gain an extra zero, turning to 500 liras.
And finally, cell phone companies start spamming their customers with bulk messages, such as: “Send a message to #### with your partner’s name to join the ‘Lover’s Day competition’ or to ‘test your compatibility.’”
Politics is also a featured staple in any conversation, and Syria Comment brings us the latest updates and analysis from around Syria and the world, with the provocative headline of "Has Washington Decided to Focus on Syrian-Israeli Peace?":
In short, the return of an ambassador is good, but playing along with a peace process that is long on process and short on peace will be difficult for Syria, which has none of the media savvy that Israel has.
Damascus undoubtedly fears that Mitchell will ask Syrians to meet with Netanyahu without conditions.
Syria believes this is tantamount to normalizing relations without any Israeli concession.
And finally, we'll sit down with Syrian Foodie in London, and finish our tour with a delicious Damascene treat, Ful Nabit:
Ful Nabit is boiled fava beans served with salt and cumin.
The seller cart will have huge pot with the beans slowly simmering.
The beans are served in a proper glass or china bowls rather than paper wrap or a plastic plate, which I find adds a nice touch. to the experience.
You usually get a glass of the cooking stock and half a lemon to accompany your ful.
The cooking stock flavoured with salt, cumin and a squeeze of lemon makes a delicious (but not at all pretty) side drink.

Broken elephant tusk found in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, by Terry FeuerbornOpposition is mounting against Zambia's and Tanzania's proposals to be allowed by CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, to sell their government held ivory stockpiles.
The Baraza blog published the content of the proposals that Zambia and Tanzania have put forward and Kenya's opposing proposal.
Maina explains on Baraza
On the one hand is the anti-trade range states consisting of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone.
On the other hand, each with it’s own proposal is Zambia and Tanzania, who want to be allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles come the March 13-25 Doha meeting – the 15th CITES Conference of Parties (CoP15).
Both sides have sent their proposals to the CITES secretariat and the secretariat has generously posted the proposals on their website.
In a different blog post on Baraza, Paula writes about the UK's resolve to vote against the two proposals:
The UK has said no to ivory sales.
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said last night: “At the CITES meeting in March, the UK will vote against the proposals from Tanzania and Zambia to sell ivory stocks, and we would urge other countries to vote against such a sale.
Paula writes on Ban Ivory - a new blog at WildlifeDirect dedicated to the campaign against ivory - asking "Are elephants worth more than their teeth".
She asks: "Are elephants just a source of a valuable commodity, ivory?
Or do elephants deserve special treatment?"
Paula points out that inspite of all the support that Africans can expect from outside, the battle for the elephant will have to start with Africans.
She says:
At the end of the day the protest against the trade in ivory will have to be led by Africans if the rest of the world is to take any notice which makes Kenya’s campaign so powerful.
But as long as the Chinese and other Asians markets continue to provide markets for ivory trinkets and refuse to implement domestic enforcement, a renewed ban on trade in ivory will fail and we will continue to lose elephants.
A group known as the Kenya Elephant Forum is leading the Kenyan civil society in the protest against ivory trade resumption and have produced fact sheets on the issue.
Harvey Croze, blogging on the Amboseli Trust for Elephants pages says
ATE is against the trade.
We have been working with like-minded NGOs and individuals under the aegis of the Kenya Elephant Forum (KEF) to provide strategic information to a body of sympathetic African elephant range states called the African Elephant Coalition (AEC).
In this blog post, Harvey has included links to the KEF Fact Sheets that you may want to read in order to understand the ivory problem and the likely implication of the Tanzania/Zambia proposals.
At least 7,000 protesters gathered on the streets of Kaliningrad , the country's westernmost city, on January 30 to demand, among other things, the resignation of the regional governor Georgy Boos and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
But don't count on the leading Russian media outlets to tell you about it.
The biggest and most popular TV channels keep their silence.
Mainstream newspapers and radio stations ignore the rally and go about their business like nothing happened.
But it only takes a quick glance at the most popular blog posts on RuNet (Russian Internet) to realize that the protest in Kaliningrad is the hottest topic of the day.
Famous political leaders, journalists and regular netizens flooded the blogosphere with their takes on the protest.
LJ user b-nemtsov), a former Russian Deputy Prime Minister, wrote an inspiring post "Kaliningrad is the hope of free Russia" where he stressed the uniqueness of the protest in Kaliningrad :
Since the proposed bans on the wearing of the burqa in France, the issue has been simmering in the Australian blogosphere.
An Australian radio shock-jock, and ex-police officer, drew criticism recently over his opposition to the wearing of the burqa in public.
Michael Smith argued that bank staff and shop assistants are concerned with possible criminal misuse.
He also suggested that young children are frightened by encounters with women wearing the “full-on burqa”, comparing it to “kids crying, getting the fright of their lives when seeing Santa Claus”.
A radio interview with Smith can be heard at Michael Smith Meets the Press.
When the French bans were proposed during the middle of 2009, Canberra journalist Virginia Haussegger argued on her blog for its prohibition on the grounds of gender equality:
By covering herself in a burka, a woman is relinquishing the right to express herself as a female.
She is agreeing to suppress her own sexuality.
There is no place here for the burka.
Australians must rally to have the burka banned.
Ban the Burka
Anna Greer at The Punch blogs about, “human rights and social justice issues and … the state of the world”.
She has a totally different take on women’s rights:
No matter what you think of Islamic veiling one thing is for sure – criminalising the women who wear the burqa or niqab is only going to render them more invisible. …This selective concern for women’s rights is merely a way for people to articulate their racist nationalism and it’s an attitude that can be found through all levels of society – in the general populace, in the media, in the government.
Anna finishes with a touch of irony:
Imposing dress codes on people in order to oppose the imposing of dress codes on people is completely counterproductive, but as I outlined above, that’s not the real reason these laws are being considered, is it?
Burqa ban is about our fears not their oppression
Smith’s views were probed at Andrew Landeryou’s online site VexNews:
It’s a scary debate that Smith has started at one level because vilifying people on religious grounds or for their religious customs that don’t harm others can be a slippery slope.
… Part of the complexity is that some Muslims – and other religions for that matter – wear hair-covering as part of their religious tradition.
Presumably no one other than the bigoted have an issue with that.
Hopefully the legitimate issue of canvassing security concerns in banks or other vulnerable areas that could be terror or robbery targets won’t be confused with the agenda of those who wish to vilify one of the world’s great religions.
BURQA BAN BANK BRAWL: Radio host says no face covering in banks but is he race-baiting?
In a longer article at Online Opinion, Sadanand Dhume, the author of My Friend the Fanatic: Travels with an Indonesian Islamist, canvasses both sides of this emotive issue.
He concludes with a positive view of the French debate:
In the end, though the French brand of in-your-face secularism may come under criticism by both Muslims and Western liberals, the country’s experience holds valuable lessons for the rest of the world.
France has not suffered a major terrorist attack since a spate of bombings in the 1990s linked to the civil war in Algeria.
And in a 2006 Pew poll of Muslim attitudes, France was the only major European country where nearly half of Muslims felt they were citizens of their country before being members of their faith.
(In Germany, Britain and Spain, overwhelming majorities claimed a primary allegiance to Islam.)
Ultimately, this record more than anything else will guide French policy on a sensitive subject.
The French burqa ban: culture clash unveiled
Fortunately 'bigots' do not have the support of the mainstream Australian political parties.
Nevertheless, there was some disquiet recently when Tony Abbott, the leader of the Federal Opposition, raised the question of minority rights and multiculturalism:
Migrants would be more popular if minority leaders encouraged them to adopt more mainstream values and abide by the law, he said.
"The inescapable minimum that we insist upon is obedience to the law," Mr Abbott said.
"It would help to bolster public support for immigration and acceptance of social diversity if more minority leaders were as ready to show to mainstream Australian values the respect they demand of their own."
Obey the law at least, Abbott tells migrants
While the antics of President Zuma have always generated intense and lively debate in the South African blogosphere, this time it is the controversial politician and the president of the African National Congress Youth League, Julius Malema, who's making headlines.
Recently, Malema led students in singing an old Anti-Apartheid struggle song called Kill the Boer.
He is facing criminal charges for the song.
Let's see reactions from South African bloggers.
Blogoff!!! writes a post entitled "Shoot the Boers, they are rapists!!!!":
Julius Malema
He is such an imbecile, and they think that this little Pedi will become our next president.
I am so immigrating to another country if he becomes our commander in chief.
People think that Zuma makes us look like monkeys; well Julius will do way worse than the honourable JZ. . .in his sleep!!!
He sang an old struggle song “Shoot the Boers, they are rapists”!
Wha!
I love the fact that he believes in Democracy, but spreads hate speech!
Mr. Jackson Mthembu, spokesperson of the ANC, is actually defending him, saying it is not his fault and that he was quoted, or whatever, out of context.
Well I think Julius is stupid and ignorant and a racist, but please do not quote me out of context!
That is so not what I mean, hello!!
Rea from "My Life and World" discusses Malema's outburst in a post entitled, very aptly I might add, "Put down that scissors Malema, before someone gives you a damn hiding!!!!!":
We all know what happens when you run with scissors right?
Well that is exactly what Malema is doing right now, running around like a spiteful child who doesn’t want to listen to his mother.
The moment when he falls down and stick himself in the eye all his little friends are going to abandon him and run away leaving him bleeding like a stuck pig.
He won’t listen to anyone telling him what he should do.
You won’t believe that we are hosting the Fifa World Cup Soccer, the way he is acting.
If he thinks any overseas visitors will come here to pump this country full of money when it seems as if unrest is at the order of the day here, he is in stall for a very rude awakening.
But coming off from Malema's rant, the ANC and the South African President were quick to defend one of their executive leaders.
Common Dialogue writes, "The ANC will talk to Malema about his racial utterances?
That would be a first!":
The ANC says it will “engage” Youth League president Julius Malema on his recent racial outburst at a student rally.
Fat chance!
The party’s spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi said:”We are always in contact with the youth league, we will continue talking to them… even in this instance we would engage with them,” he said.
Malema, according to media reports, led students at the University of Johannesburg in a song saying: “Shoot the boere , they are rapists.”
Now, we all know that Malema has been insulting people including senior members of the ANC and its alliance partners at will.
Nothing has happened to him.
A few old-school white South African's have joined the fray in the blogosphere pointing out the hypocrisy.
Wessel's Place puts up his frustrations on his blog:
While Julius Malema was singing "Shoot the Boers" at an ANC Youth league rally, farmers were being killed in the Limpopo province.
And no black political leader said anything.
I find this sad.
I find a great inconsistency in our country.
If any white person uttered the words "Shoot the Zulu's" or "Shoot the Xhosa's", they would have reason to fear for their lives.
In fact, when someone dared finger the presidential convoy, this person was arrested and humiliated by the authorities.
I want to believe in this country.
I want to believe in its potential.
I want to believe that my children can grow up here without having to apologize for being white.
Blogging at My Digital Life, The Source puts up a fairly long rant entitled "Kill the Kafir song?" ...
So the ANC is defending Julius Malema for singing a song containing the lyrics, “Shoot the boere, they are rapists”.
ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu told Sapa by phone on Thursday morning that he will defend Malema and that the song should be seen in context (Read full article).
He continues to say:
"The issue is, indeed, some people might be correct that there might be songs we should not sing.
Let them put them on the agenda and convince the ANC that we should not sing those songs and tell us why.
"But then they should also look at songs that were sung by the forces of oppression."
Let’s look at this statement
Forces of oppression would most probably refer to the white government in the apartheid era and thereby extend to all whites I suppose.
Now I was in an Afrikaans school and I was also in the Voortrekkers.
For those who don’t know, the Voortrekkers is like the boy scouts, but it celebrates the heritage of the Afrikaner nation who moved from the coastal regions inland toward what is now known as the Freestate, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.
Alex Matthews at Thought Leader asks, "If killing the boers is OK, how about blacks, women and gays?" :
ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu has defended Julius Malema’s lusty renditions of the infamous “kill the boers, they are rapists” song, arguing (according to this Sapa article) that the “the lyrics of the song had been quoted out of context”.
“This song was sung for many years even before Malema was born.
Julius doesn’t even know who’s the writer of the song.
He got it from us .
You must blame the ANC, don’t blame Julius.
But when you blame the ANC, then contextualise it,” Sapa quotes Mthembu as saying.
By Mthembu’s logic, it is completely acceptable inciting people to kill others, provided there is “context”.
What does that mean?
Well, so as long as “kill the blacks” was an old apartheid song, embittered racists can chant it from the rooftops.
So long as “kill the women” was some sort of misogynist anthem, chauvinists can do the Macarena to it in male-only clubs.
So long as “kill the gays” was a major hit for bigots as they set lesbians alight, they can scream it as they throw the gays off bridges and into manholes.
Consequently, Malema has apologised, which ClassicMalema.co.za covers in "Malema Says Sorry":
A very rare moment for this moron to apologise for his statements.
I think the ANC came down on his ass big time.
Is the road coming to an end for Ju Ju?
Azad Essa at Thought Leader posts up a brilliant satirical piece covering the dodgy contracts Julius Malema has amassed in his very well-endowed position in government,"Two kilo's of tenderised Malema, please!":
With the country in a tizz after sizzling reactions to severe price hikes as “tenderised Malema” hit the newsstands, fictitious members of the ANC top-brass met at an emergency meeting on Monday to resolve the latest crisis in the party.
As news of government tenders enhancing the meagre salaries of government officials, their families, and their families’ families, appeared to have boosted newspaper record sales over the weekend, ANC leadership came to a set of binding resolutions in a bid to root out corruption in government.
In a dramatic shift the ANC released a statement early this morning saying that it is within the right of a senior cadre not to partake in government deals.
And what does Google think of Julius Malema?:
So heres the deal.
Open www.Google.com and type in “Julius Malema is" – wait a second or two to see the suggestions that Google will recommend.
Hilarious
Definitetly, Zuma and Malema will remain a hot topic in the South African blogosphere for a long time.
The February 27 earthquake in Chile left more than 2 million displaced, at least 497 confirmed deaths , and an estimated US$30 billion in damage.
However, the lawlessness that ensued after the quake also left Chileans with a moral question: Is Chilean society a just one?
After the quake hit, a majority of Chileans helped others, assisted their neighbors in need, shared their food surpluses, and donated money in unprecedented ways.
Nevertheless, a minority, however small, looted non-essentials, robbed homes, and intentionally set fire to department stores, despite the fact that the Chilean government allowed people to take essentials, such as milk, baby formula, bread, and flour.
Photo of empty supermarket in Concepción by heedmane and used under a Creative Commons license.
Chilean TV stations brought this reality to the homes of millions in a fairly accurate fashion , and so Chileans saw how some helped themselves to plasma TVs, refrigerators, and DVD players.
The images of crime and looting, and especially the looting of non-essentials, began a national debate about existing social and economic inequalities in Chile.
In an article titled “What type of wood are we made of? ,” Ricardo Carbone, a blogger, professor, and Director of the Center for Social Reflection and Action at Alberto Hurtado University, argues that the quake exposed major social problems, and that it brought down the facades and appearances of Chilean society.
Here, Carbone refers to the facades of people who looted non-essentials and worsened an already difficult situation:
A township government in Sichuan Province is being called “China’s first completely nude government” after township officials issued salary and expenditure information online.
The reference to nudity recently found in many Chinese publications denotes an unprecedented level of transparency in local government.
The government of Baimiao Township in northeastern Sichuan disclosed its proposed 2010 expenditure Mar. 12, along with the salaries of local officials and 2009 expenditure information, reports Southern Weekend.
According to the Sichuan Daily Post, the online information includes items ranging from cars, entertainment and dining fees, to paper cups, stationery, and envelopes, and is posted on the townships website.
Officials at all levels of government in China have a reputation for running up high bills while wining and dining guests and other higher ranking cadres.
According to sources in the Chinese media, these transparency measures may help local citizens monitor the spending habits of their government.
This development comes at a time when counties across China begin to experiment with a similar system requiring officials to report their family income and investments.
Altai County in the western province of Xinjiang implemented an income-reporting system for officials in January 2009.
But Baimiao Township is the first governmental unit to post a comprehensive yearly expenditure, thus earning the name "completely nude government".
According to online opinion, such developments may pressure other townships or higher levels of government to issue expenditure statements and increase transparency.
Some have labeled the move as hype.
A post at Qingming and Guyu calls the “naked government” move daring although still in need of more thorough reform.
If social media is changing communication patterns in the West, it sure has not fallen short of touching interesting places on the African continent.
During the 2008 Ghana Presidential elections, many Ghanaians took to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to share concerns and opinions about the process.
When the winner of the race was announced, these same sites became spots for jubilation – at least for supporters of the winning party.

Online celebration events have been scheduled, for instance, after the 2008 U.S. Presidential elections, and thousands of people from all over the world have signed up to attend, virtually.
So it is no surprise that people from this same digital era have decided to take advantage of the techno-crazed lifestyle and jump on an Accra Twestival in Ghana.
Well, this time it will take place offline.
MacJordan, one of Global Voices’ own, is collaborating with Rodney Quarcoo, a recognized Ghanaian photographer to bring this seemingly entertaining event to the people of Ghana.
But this is no ordinary affair.
As MacJordan coined it in a post about the event:
is aimed at supporting a great cause; that is securing Educational materials for children in deprived areas in Ghana.
He further elaborates in the post:
On Thursday 25 March 2010, people in hundreds of cities around the world including Accra will come together offline to rally around the important cause of Education by hosting local events to have fun and create awareness.
Twestival™ (or Twitter Festival) uses social media for social good.
All of the local events are organized 100% by volunteers and 100% of all donations go direct to projects.
Where will the funds go?
The same thread provides this information:
Each city hosting a Twestival will be given the opportunity to select an area of education to support.
This will be recognized with a special icon on their website once they have set a goal.
For as little as $28USD they can provide the uniform, books, pencils, and paper a child needs to attend one year of school.
Concern Worldwide is able to guarantee that 100% of Twestival funds will go direct to project costs.
This means that the money would be used for material purchases (curriculum, desks, pencils) as well as project activities such as construction of schools; rehabilitation of classrooms; teacher/management training; PTAs; HIV/AIDS school clubs; water and sanitation in schools; health education in schools; education advocacy; vocational/life-skills training for youth, farmers and women; and curriculum development for secondary school/university.
The vibrantly designed logo for this event, created by Quarcoo, does a great job of evoking excitement about the festival.
A February 9th tweet on Quarcoo’s Twitter page in response to the announcement of the event read:
Education gives people a voice in their communities.
It also makes people aware of their rights and opportunities.
Indeed.
Education is an area with much need of intervention on the continent, especially rural Africa.
It would be interesting to see how much need is met with Accra’s Twestival.
From March 29 to 31, Global Pulse 2010 aims to gather over 20.000 individuals and representatives of organisations in an online conversation dealing with topics ranging from human development to science and technologies.
The event is sponsored by US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the goal is to give world citizens an opportunity to voice opinions and share ideas for innovative solutions to social issues.
According to USAID, the inspiration for the online event is a speech President Barack Obama gave in Cairo in June 2009 in which he said he would promote partnership with the rest of the world.
Ten topics of discussion
The event will start at 0 am (GMT) and will last 72 hours non-stop, and participants will be able to follow and comment in several live discussions simultaneously.
All discussions will be led by featured opinion leaders, decision makers and NGO members, including Youssou N'Dour , famous Senegalese singer, deeply engaged in the fight against malaria, Iqbal Z. Quadir, founder of Grameenphone in Bangladesh, and even Ethan Zuckerman, co-founder of Global Voices Online.
Innovative technology
Gathering thousands of people online at the same time could be tricky.
Fortunately, the forum technology that will be used, IBM Jam, has been already been tested in previous events.
Bill Tipton took part in Habitat Jam - a three-day online event in 2005 to solicit ideas on urban sustainability.
In a blog at the Global Dialogue Center he shares his experience:
I know this can work from participating in such an event in 2005 Tens of thousands of individuals – including government and business leaders, NGOs and specialists — came together to discuss real issues and concerns facing the world’s urban communities.
I still meet and work with people I met in that truly remarkable Jam and expect to meet other extraordinary individuals in Global Pulse in 2010.
Participating
To join the Global Pulse event, you only need a computer and internet access - and you also have to register in advance (for free).
Before March 29, you can follow @globalpulse2010 on Twitter as well as the hashtag #gp2010.
There is also a Facebook page with almost 700 fans, where suggestions have already been posted.
One idea by Oliver Mupila goes:
Query: Can Global Pulse suggest effective indicators for tracking the progress of grand corruption cases from referral to the investigating agencies, through to the Director of Prosecutions, onward to the courts and progress while they are in court without compromising the individuals right to a fair trial/hearing or reputation before they are convicted?
What is considered good practice in this area and are there any countries that do this particularly well?
And why are news writers in Africa not in good books the government?
According to Dr. Rajiv Shah, Adminsitrator of USAID, the online summit will gather "individuals who are not normally seated at the table with key decision makers".
Could this be a move towards the future of democracy?
It should at least be interesting to find out.
Exclusive #iraq10 picture from polling station in #Baghdad: www.mict-international.org/1a.jpg
It's election day in Iraq and the Twittersphere has been abuzz with updates since the early morning.
To keep tweeps updated, a special service is up at @iraqelections where "30 correspondents from across Iraq will twitter report on election events from 10am hour by hour as they witness them on the ground." It is a project coordinated by German media development organization MICT - Media in Cooperation and Transition.
@iraqelections urges readers to:
Follow our coverage of #iraqelections on Sunday, live here on Twitter.
40 Iraqi journalists #tweeting regular election updates!
Another announcement reads:
We're live - translations are on their way!
Follows us for live tweets about the #iraqelection from inside #Iraq.
Join the debate #iraq10
Updates by observers on the ground are typical of many elections around the world, except that Iraq is a special case.
Bombs went off throughout the day and clashes were reported between various factions.
On @iraqelections, the reporters who toyed with Twitter did a fantastic job keeping us updated using social networking tools.
In one update, Laith reports: Laith: Baghdad: Tens of families from the AlKaradah region denied voting because their names are not on the voters register
From Sulaimaniya, Jamal writes:
#SULAIMANIYA, Jamal: Voting stations are closed.
Press is not allowed to enter and monitor the counting of votes. #iraq10
Elsewhere on the Twittersphere, @iawia1 notes:
American @jeffmeyerson is positive:
Celebrate with freedom-loving Iraqis as today they make their case for democracy. #Iraq
And Miguel Marquez, ABC News' correspondent, sums up the day saying:
#Iraq elex: 38 killed,73 injured.
Nearly 40 explosions.
Still the Iraqis turned out to vote.
Looks like vote cnt will be higher outside BGD
In 2009, the Dominican people stood up to fight against a cement factory that would be installed in the Los Haitises National Park.
In 2010, it appears that another cause is mobilizing thousands of young people and adults - the presence of the mining consortium Barrick Gold in Cotuí, the head municipality in the province of Sánchez Ramírez, which is home to one of the largest gold mines in the world: Pueblo Viejo (Old Town), with estimated reserves of 24 million troy ounces of gold.
Activists are concerned about the terms of the agreement with the Dominican State, as well as environmental impacts on the region.

The contemporary history of the Pueblo Viejo gold mine, which produces gold oxide at the top and gold sulfide at the bottom, begins in 1975 with Rosario Resources Corporation, a company that later passed into the hands of the Dominican State under the name Rosario Dominicana, and whose operations ceased permanently in 1999 because of economic and environmental factors.
In 2002, the mine found a new leaseholder, the Canadian company Placer Dome, which signed a 33-year contract before being bought by another Canadian company, Barrick Gold, in 2006.
Barrick Gold has been in the sights of the Dominicans some of the details about the signed contract were made public, a contract which was approved at the end of 2009 in Congress by the vast majority of legislators.
Marihal, of the blog Desde la República Dominicana , emphasizes the following details about the renegotiated contract:
STE Research Camp under water
At dawn on Thursday, 4 March 2010, a massive flash flood hit Samburu in northern Kenya destroying 6 tourist lodges, some wildlife research camps and leaving thousands marooned on roof tops and on trees.
This wave of rushing water came from the Ewaso Nyiro River which has burst it's banks following heavy rain around Mount Kenya.
The Ewaso Lions blog writes:
Around 5am this morning , a giant flashflood came down the Ewaso Nyiro river, washing away lodges and camps.
Our friends at Elephant Watch and Save The Elephants managed to reach high ground, but the camps were wiped out.
Elsewhere, people were on treetops and roofs waiting for help.
The British Army, Tropic Air, and others spent the day evacuating people out of the area.
Paula Kahumbu shares on the Baraza blog a communication from the Save the Elephants whose research base was destroyed:
Today we woke up to reports from our guys at the research centre that Samburu is under water!
The whole of Samburu is flooded!
All our tents have been washed away!
Our research camp as we know it is gone!
Luckily all our guys are safe but hanging from trees and at hilltops waiting to be rescued by helicopter!
Paula's blog post says, "As of now the flood waters are apparently receding but all the camps in Samburu and Shaba have been evacuated." This is in anticipation of more rain that is likely to come. The Ewaso Lions bloggers say, "What’s especially frightening is that a lot more rain is expected."
The Ewaso Lions posted some photos - together with an appeal - which were sent by their blogger, Shivani, who's currently in Samburu.
The appeal urges people to donate through the blog or to contact their Nairobi office (for those in Nairobi and wishing to give food and clothes).
WildlifeDirect has also posted an appeal using the same photos.
"When a maid runs away from her employer's house, the police station is unable to act because there's no law criminalizing runaway maids.
So the police station officer tells the Lebanese employee to say that she stole money," writes Ethiopian Suicides.
Through videos, we see and learn about the cultural importance and economical boost that working with fabric is giving some people and organizations in Mali.
From a women's group which claim to have placed Mali as a power in the cloth dying industry, to artists who have decided to make Bogolanfini or mud dyed cloths their medium, to the touristic industry that has grown around this art.
On Sunday March 14th, all French citizens including those in the four French overseas departments (Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Reunion) were asked to vote for the regional elections and the regional assembly in charge of devolved powers such as planning adult professional training, building and funding public high schools, financing and promoting cultural projects.
The vote took place in a very busy electoral period: Martinicans were asked to decide for more autonomy in their department, only in January.
Two major elections in a three-month period may have been too much for the 55.55% of Martinican voters who decided to stay home and not vote, as shown by Bondamanjak's post .
Blogger Evolution Martinique comments on this high abstention figure:
After the new Qatari administration announced that 250 employees in the widely read IslamOnline news website (IOL) would be laid off, hundreds of employees, editors, and journalists started an angry sit-in.
The situation escalated rapidly when the administration threatened to call state security to break the sit-in, but employees confirmed they will continue their open strike till their demands are fulfilled.
It is worth mentioning that this strike may be the first instance in which strikers use new media efficiently and effectively to draw all the attention needed to support their cause, from continuous Twitter updates to Live streaming.
Nadia El Awady, an ex-journalist for IOL, was closely following the situation and posted a statement issued by IslamOnline striking employees on her blog:
The situation has miserably escalated inside IOL HQ in Cairo, after the Qatari management sent lawyers to take over the building, with all its properties and papers, and investigate with 250 employees who sent a statement to Sheikh Qaradawy, Chairman of the Board, complaining from unjust actions by the new management.
Some sources said that the hidden reason behind investigating with these employees is to fire then, and so ban them from all their financial rights.
Well-informed sources within the institution said that the aim of the investigation with employees is to arbitrarily dismiss them and therefore deprive them from all their financial dues.
While Tadamon Masr mentioned that the dispute may be because the new Qatari administration wants to move the HQ from Cairo to Doha, AbdelMoniem was skeptical and wondered if it was all about extremists who want to silence moderate voices on websites like Islam Online.
Zeinobia expressed a similar opinion to AbdelMoniem, saying:
The new Qatari administration is said to be a very conservative one that believes the Website should stick to conservative religious issue and removed other sections
On Twitter, Mohammed, another former journalist in IOL, broke the news saying:
@MohammedY: To journos in Egypt & Arab world: Journalists @ #IslamOnline r being bullied by new management into silence against bad company practices
@MohammedY: So when workers sign a petition stating their problems, the management puts the workers under investigation.
WTF is wrong at #IslamOnline ?
Abdullah El Shamy and Muhammad Ghafari, who are among the strikers, were working on the live stream, continuously updating their Twitter accounts and posting pictures from the place.
@Ghafari : For those who are concerned, Live updates on #IslamOnline employees' strike here: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iol-on-air
Nadia El Awady was also updating through her friends on Twitter around the clock, where she mentioned:
@NadiaE : Female employee at #Islamonline talking about staying overnight at the office in her sleeping bag to continue her strike @NadiaE : #islamonline employee @mos3abof calls on audience to backup website content
Egyptian blogger Ahmed Shokeir expressed an opinion that nearly everybody felt, commenting on how new media tools are used differently this time: أعتقد أن إعتصام إسلام اون لاين هو الأول الذي يتم بثه مباشر من موقع الحدث فيديو ستريم على الإنترنت - لاشك انها ستصبح وسيلة فعالة ومنشرة قريبا I thinkthe IslamOnline sit-in may be the first to be live streamed online.
I believe it will be an effective and widely spread tool in the near future.
It is worth mentioning that a rumor spread on Twitter that EL Qaradawi might resign, as per Mohammed:
@MohammedY : #IslamOnline management in Qatar have been evading Al-Qaradawi's calls bec he wanted to take sides with employees (through Fathi at IOL)
And was supported by another Tweet for Nadia:
@NadiaE: Motaz Al-Khateeb producer of Sheikh Al-Qaradawi's Aljazeera show spoke with Sheikh's secretary who says he is still considering resignation
Before sleeping, Ghafari concluded his updates saying they will not stop their strike unless all these demands are fulfilled: Employees strike will continue till the morning, till decisions are issued to grantee our rights officially.

Saying goodbye to some of the orphans (photo from the Village of Hope official website)
Last week, 20 staff members of the Village of Hope, a small orphanage in a small town in rural Morocco, were deported from the country without warning, under charges of proselytizing.
The Village has quietly existed for the past ten years, and is staffed mostly by Christians from Western countries.
Staff members claim they have always been transparent about their Christian identities to Moroccan authorities, without incident.
For many of the children, the orphanage is the only home they have ever known.
The Village of Hope's official Web site hosts a statement, endorsed by all of the staff members who were asked to leave the country, which reads:
On Monday 8th March, all 16 overseas workers, including 10 parents, and 13 natural-born dependents, were told they were to be evicted from the site and country.
The reason given was that the parents had been proselytizing, with no explanation of who, when, where or how this was alleged to have occurred.
No charges concerning the welfare and care of the children have ever been raised as a concern by the Moroccan authorities in the 10 year history of VOH.
The Moroccan authorities have not produced any evidence of the alleged offence and they gave only a few hours for the parents to pack up belongings and explain to their children that they might never see them again.
Few media outlets have picked up on the story (the official Moroccan news agency is one), but a number of bloggers with personal connections to the Village have begun to spread word about the incident, some with hopes of returning the staff to Morocco.
Blogger Elizabeth Shelby, a Christian worker who volunteered at the orphanage in the past, is calling for prayer from her community, but also is hoping to find explanation from the government as to why the sudden change of heart occurred.
She writes:
It has been over 24 hours since 20 workers (most, parents) at the Village of Hope were taken from their children, unexpectedly by Moroccan officials.
They were given thirty minutes to pack their belongings and leave the country, with no guarantee of ever seeing their Moroccan children again.
The Village of Hope has been in compliance and worked with the Moroccan government for 10 years, and have had very few problems.
As of January 4th, Morocco has a new Minister of Justice (ironic) Mohammad Naciri, one who feels he must exercise his power in order to shut down the Village of Hope because he believes "Christians are proselytizing."
Shelby is also leading a campaign on Twitter, using the hashtag #MoroccoOrphans and has started a Facebook group.
The Moroccan Dispatches has written a thoughtful piece exploring the various aspects of the government's decision, as well as the operations of the orphanage.
In respect to both, the blogger writes:
As I mentioned, it's hard to know what really is permissible and what is not in Morocco since a rule on the books does not necessarily mean anything.
So perhaps, the Moroccan authorities turned a blind eye for the past few decades just as they do with alcohol, hashish, prostitution, and speeding.
Or perhaps The Village of Hope hid some of their activities.
I do not know.
An American blogger in Morocco writes in with support for the Village:
honestly thought they were complying with regulations, but were interrogated and deported with almost no time to pack or to say goodbye to the children.
Orphans have a particularly hard lot in Islamic countries, where, even if adopted, they don't have the same rights as biological children, and even the Muslim Moroccans who worked with these kids got kicked off the premises, so there is not a single familiar face taking care of them right now.
Please be in prayer for the children, for those who were deported, and for those who may still be deported.
Its a rough situation, especially since Morocco has been considered a moderate nation which encourages peaceful relations between peoples of different faiths.
Keep the people of this beautiful country in your prayers.
On the anniversary of the coup d'etat of March 17, 2009 in Madagascar, individual sanctions are about to be imposed upon the current leaders of Madagascar for not respecting the resolutions of Maputo that were previously agreed upon by all participants.
This decision come after a warning a month earlier from the African Union and the International Contact Group and follow several annulments of international trade accords that have affected the local industries.
They also come on the heel of reports by Amnesty International and the US State Department that document multiple human rights violations and ongoing illegal international trafficking of precious rosewood from Madagascar rain forests.
According to a Malagasy insider, the individual sanctions would result in a freeze of the financial assets of the people present in the list and possible arrest if they travel outside Madagascar (fr).
The government remains defiant in the face of the impending sanctions, arguing that only national elections will provide an effective exit to the crisis.
The organization and monitoring of these elections are not clearly defined yet and parliamentary elections have already been postponed from the initial proposed schedule.
The political deadlock is compounded by humanitarian concerns caused by Tropical Storm Hubert that killed 14 and left 37,891 homeless after making landfall earlier in the week.

Reflecting upon the upcoming sanctions on national Malagasy leaders, Citoyenne Malgache, a blogger based in Madagascar, has mixed feelings about the possible consequences for the everyday Malagasy citizens.
She is torn between satisfaction and fear (fr):
People in Ilafitsignana are now deprived of their farmland...
As a result, there are many more people living off fishing, and resources are no longer enough... Ambatsy and sâro are almost non-existent. fiambazahaare still around but not as many...angora lo and varavarà were so easy to catch in the past but are almost non-existent now... tofoky are also hard to find (author's note: names in italics are species of fish in Malagasy)
According to the World Bank, the struggle of the Malagasy economy has already forced the government to slash $200 million USD for the public service from their national budget.
Achille52 explains that the educational system is the first to suffer and that this budget cut will have dire consequences on the future of the nation (fr):
In Jos, conflict seems to recur in ever-narrowing cycles: deadly riots rocked the city in 1994, 2001, 2008 and -not even two months ago- in January 2010.
Like the previous riots, the current conflict in Jos has been fought along sectarian lines – Jos lies on the border between Nigeria's Muslim-majority North and Christian-majority South.
Access to land and resources is often determined by whether one is a native, or “indigene”, of the historically Christian city, or a “settler” from elsewhere (“settlers” are most often Muslims from the North; see a Human Rights Watch report on the subject here for more on the subject).
Many sources have placed the death toll in the hundreds: Al-Jazeera and the BBC both reported more than 500 casualties, although one government source put the figure at 55 official deaths. Quick burials make it difficult to accurately assess the total dead, while political considerations also lead to discrepancies in the numbers.
Shuaibu Mohammed of Reuters gives one explanation:
Death tolls have been highly politicised in previous outbreaks of unrest in central Nigeria, with various factions accused of either exaggerating the figures for political ends or downplaying them to try to douse the risk of reprisals.
In the blogosphere, horror, shame and empathy were the prevalent emotions.
Linda Ikeji posted a photo on her blog which graphically displayed the carnage.
She wrote:
NO, I won't take the picture down.
This is our shame and failure as a country.
Let's all stare at it!
A commenter on her site agreed with her decision:
Thanks for leaving it up because we have to stop pretending everything is alright...it is time for these things to stop....
Several bloggers drew parallels between the earthquake in Haiti and the violence in Jos.
Tywo, another commenter on Linda Ikeji's post wrote:
God has blessed Nigeria so much.
I mean, we rarely have natural disasters and things like that.
We only have deaths that are caused by heartless humans.
The truth is we are not moving forward.
Babajidesalu shared a similar view:
As the world is experiencing natural disasters, Nigeria is experiencing self inflicted disasters.
The latest massacre in Jos attests to this observation.
In the aftermath of the January 2010 riots, one blogger started a site, We are Jos, to help the victims of the rioting.
She explained her motivation as follows:
It was the effort of wyclef jean that made other stars come together to give towards Haiti.
I noticed some Naija bloggers even gave towards Haiti while at the same time decrying what happened in Jos, VERBALLY while saying God should help Nigeria.
I've often wondered why we Nigerians complain and proffer no explanations or solutions to the problems that herald us.
In whatever small way I can, I try to solve a problem or even make an effort.
F, another commenter on Linda Ikeji's post, saw the problem as broader than religion, and endemic to the country as a whole:
The nonsense will stop in Jos when the nonsense stops in Abuja.
All this shadowy politics needs to cease so that the people can have access to basic amenities.
They say a hungry man is an angry man.
It is the same in the Niger Delta.
If everyone was well-fed, had access to quality education, power supply, clean water and a decent standard of living, who would think of trying to kill off another religious/ethnic group seen to be "competing for space"?
...We will continue to express anger/disgust at these killings- this will not stop them from happening.
Dealing with the root cause is the only solution to this on-going tragedy.
Adeola Aderounmu expressed a similar view, laying the blame with Nigeria's leaders:
The Jos issue is not a local issue.
It is a reflection of the lack of democracy and failure of the system.
We have no defined system and the country is built on very useless people instead of strong institutions and good principles of governance.
But a commenter on his post disagreed:
You are always separating the elite from the masses.
At one time or another the elite emerged from the masses.
So you can’t really separate them. (Many members of the masses are striving to join the elite).
The failure of Nigeria and Nigerians as a people collectively has to be shared all round.
Nigerians will have to look at themselves as a society and question why they have systematically over 50 years done nothing to arrest the slide into oblivion and hopelessness?
Why is it when the get a sniff of power, they do all the wrong things?
The fact is that most of society is corrupt, as such corrupt practices are condoned, in some cases celebrated...
Since the violence began on Sunday, army and police forces have taken control of the city, making more than 100 arrests.
SolomonSydelle reported on the possibility that the International Criminal Court may step in to bring judicial resolution to the situation and avert a spiral of future reprisals.

There is a disturbing rise in child abuse cases in Pakistan.
According to UNICEF Local Officer Shamshad Qureshi the reason is lack of proper law enforcement, negligence of parents and lack of awareness among the children and the society.
He also said that the major factor for pedophilia in Pakistan was the easy access of people to children due to the negligence of parents.
Faheem Haider at Bangladesh Foreign Policy Blog discusses about the abuse of children and child workers in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
He doesn’t mince as he shows us another very common side of child abuse:
“Unable to feed a growing family, desperate parents farm out their children to affluent homes to serve as servants, maids or nannies (child-keepers is the more proper sense in which these children are employed in those house-holds).
These children then become, effectively, the wards of their employers and are often treated like personal property.
The birth parents remain out of sight, perhaps hundreds of miles away, unaware that their babies are just so much flesh and burdened bone for the caprice and rubbed temper of their unbecomingly unkind lords.
Justice has been put aside for these children.
They are the flotsam of unsettled poverty and the repackaged gifts of unhinged circumstances.
Opportunity does not avail them; outcomes remain unmarked and the appropriate ends to which they might be working are unknown to them.
Justice is for these children an inattentive teacher.”
Fatima Bhutto is not only a influential political heir but also a humanitarian.
In a blog post in The Daily Beast she doesn’t leave much to be said by painting a grim picture of child abuse:
“The brutal murder of a 12-year-old maid, believed to have been killed by her powerful employer, has stunned the country.
But from the corrupt government to the honor killing of a wealthy woman, the country's rich always get away with it.
Shazia Masih, a tiny 12-year-old who looked years younger than her age, was laid to rest last week after a Christian funeral at Lahore's Cathedral Church.
She had been employed by the wealthy and influential former president of Lahore's Bar Association, and for a generous $8 a month she cleaned her employer's toilets, the cars that filled their suburban garage, and the filth that collected on the floors of their home.”
The term ‘child abuse’ covers a wide array of very diverse kinds of crimes subjected towards the minors.
It signifies physical as well as mental pain.
When an adult tries to use a child as a sex toy it is child abuse.
When an adult tries to appease his labour needs at a lower cost it is also child abuse.
When a child is exploited as a commodity and traded for monetary or non monetary produce it is child abuse.
When an adult forces the child to push himself beyond his strength overlooking all health guidelines for children it is child abuse.
Pakistan is a country that does little in protecting its young worlds from the many horrors of child abuse that they are exposed to in and around the green pastures.
A think tank for Japan's Cabinet, the Economic and Social Research Institute (内閣府 経済社会総合研究所) (ESRI) published a study that quantified the present status of lifetime employment and seniority-based wage (i.e. the Japanese employment system).
They used the data (1989-2008) from Basic Survey on Wage Structure (賃金構造基本統計調査) (BSWS) of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
The empirical results and commentary indicate a rare rebuke of the traditional employment system by the Government.
The study is published here.
One of the results that they quantified was the "wage curve."
This is basically standardized median wages of workers according to the their age.
ESRI showed that the wage curve "flattens out" gradually with time.
This indicates that when young workers sacrifice some pay for a stable lifestyle in the future, they do not get as much value in the current state of affairs.
The following is the graph: (please click to enlarge!)
Now the second result comes from data of the share of lifetime workers for a company.
The data shows a significant declining trend in young lifetime workers.
This indicates lower retention rates of young workers and older workers staying in their old jobs since it is too risky to find another job.
In particular, we see a large dip at year 2004 for the large firms, as that was the year the Government made it possible to use temp. workers in the manufacturing industry.
This indicates that the continuance of the status quo may be unsustainable.
The following is the graph: (please click to enlarge!)
Blogger, author and business consultant Jo Shigeyuki thinks it is significant that the Government finally admitted to the "collapse" (崩壊) of Japan's employment system.
But he is also disgusted with the apathy and the patchwork solutions (like a cap on temp. workers) shown in an attempt to fix the system.
Below he warns against a possible misunderstanding of ESRI's results:
Inspired by Ellen Miller's post on the Sunlight Foundation blog, which profiles the work of women who use technology to promote transparency in the United States, we decided to add to the list by profiling several women from around the world involved in the use of technology to make government more transparent and accountable.
The following profiles were written and researched by Renata Avila, the lead of Creative Commons Guatemala, the Director of Primer Palabra, and our researcher for Spanish-language Latin America on the Technology for Transparency Network.
It is important not only approve good laws to promote transparency and openness but also protect a free country from becoming less transparent.
An activist from Germany, Franziska Heine, initiated the most successful e-petition in German history, aimed to prevent a law which would give the German police the right to create and maintain censorship lists with websites to be blocked by German ISPs.
It was signed more than 134,000 times.
Franziska is part of the anti-censorship movement and is engaged in several activities and organizations which fight against surveillance, data mining, censorship and other threats to civil rights.
But good laws and proactive citizens are not enough; tools are also important to enable women around the world to take action and promote transparency.
Margarita Padilla, an IT engineer and the former director of the magazine Mundo Linux is making a difference.
She creates and maintains systems with a social approach and also promotes openness with her website Sin Dominio.
Mercedes de Freitas from Venezuela is the Executive Director of Transparencia Venezuela, the local chapter of Transparency International and is former Ashoka Changemaker Fellow for her work in promoting civic participation to increase government accountability.
These are surely just a few examples of women around the world who are using technology to challenge corruption, improve the performance of institutions, and create better policy to engage citizens and hold public officials accountable.
As a recent article by Alexandra Starr notes, both the fields of technology and government have long excluded women from participation despite their impressive track record for approaching both policy and technology with more realism and tact than their male counterparts.
Software companies and parliamentary buildings around the world are still mostly dominated by men, but this is changing quickly thanks to a new generation of women technologists, activists, and politicians.
I would be remiss to not highlight the work of our female researchers and research reviewers who, it must be said, have proven themselves to be the hardest working members of our team on the Technology for Transparency Network.
Renata Avila, who wrote the profiles of all of the women above, is a lawyer, human rights activist, the country lead of Creative Commons Guatemala, and the director of Primer Palabra.
She has worked with the Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation, Harvard University, the Public Voice, and Women in International Security.

Do you know other women working in the fields of technology and transparency?
Please link to their websites, blogs, and Twitter accounts in the comments section below!
In a December 2009 Global Voices article titled "ICT4D: Past mistakes, future wisdom," Aparna Ray points out that many technology for development projects have "started with a bang and later died with a whimper."
According to a recent article in the Financial Times, such is the fate of a multimillion dollar World Bank plan to supply Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan, with computers and Internet access.
According to Laurence Clarke, who heads the World Bank's program in the country and was interviewed for the article, the failure was not due to a lack of equipment or support.
Instead, the problem is a lack of will:
Laurence Clarke, head of the bank's south Sudan programme, explains that fund money was used to buy computers, software and equipment for satellite links in Juba, the south's threadbare capital.
But then "all kinds of problems came up," he says....
"Some of the ministers apparently decided they were too old to learn to use a computer, and so they showed no enthusiasm."
In some cases even their younger assistants did not know how to log on.
The recent surge in availability of mobile phones and Internet access in Africa has prompted considerable enthusiasm regarding the use of these technologies for everything from marketing and e-commerce to tracking crop diseases and reminding HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis patients to take their medicine.
But the news from Southern Sudan forces the question: is the hype surrounding information and communication technology (ICT) justified?
And how can those of us who work in this field make sure that our efforts don't result in moribundity?
As a researcher for the Technology for Transparency Network, I'm particularly interested in the way that ICT can help engage citizens in the governance of their country and encourage governments to be both transparent and accountable.
Many projects are successfully using technology for transparency; David Sasaki's recent review of the network's first eight case studies shows as much.
But, as the situation in Juba shows, technology does not magically lead toward better governance.
Sudanese blogger and Global Voices author Drima believes that Internet and mobile phones are not enough.
"ICT is merely that, a technology.
Its real usefulness is ultimately something that can only be realized if the users utilize such technology skillfully towards a good goal," he writes in an e-mail.
If technology is to have an impact, Drima says, support must come not only from donors, but from within:
"When it comes to attitudes and goals, this is something the Southern Sudanese need to fix.
And before we can even get into this whole idea of ICT as some kind of 'silver bullet' we really need to address many underlying concerns, beginning with corrupt leadership and destructive tribalism."
As Sudan moves towards elections in April, technology has the potential to play a major role in both engaging citizens and in monitoring the political process.
Sudan Votes, a bilingual web site sponsored by German organization Media in Cooperation and Transition along with Sudanese organizations Teeba Press and the Association of Inter-Media, hopes to "enhance the quality of media coverage on the elections" and "promote a better understanding across language barriers."
The site features articles on topics ranging from politics to health and culture, as well as a Sudan Electionnaire to help citizens learn more about the country's political parties.
Sudan Votes
Sudan Vote Monitor, led by the Sudan Institute for Research and Policy, plans to use Ushahidi to enable citizens to monitor and report on the elections.
Sudan Vote Monitor
In an election where "many citizens are unfamiliar with basic election processes, are opposed to multi-party competition and have doubts about whether the vote will be fair," these projects may play critical roles in educating people and documenting possible problems with the voting process.
In order to be successful, however, they must first find a way to convince citizens of their usefulness.
Both Sudan Votes and Sudan Vote Monitor appear to have substantial Sudanese involvement at the ground level, which may help them succeed where the World Bank program has failed.
As the elections loom nearer, I'll be watching closely to see how these organizations unfold.
Will they fall flat, ignored and unused by Sudanese citizens?
Or will they manage to translate technology into true civic engagement?
The March 12 anti-government rally ended peacefully with the Red Shirts vowing to return to the streets this weekend as they continue to push for the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of new elections.
The Red Shirts are planning to stage a "million-man march" on March 14, Sunday, to topple the current administration.
Many Red Shirts are supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra but not all of them are fans of the fugitive leader who was recently found guilty by the court of corruption charges.
The Red Shirts view the incumbent Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva as being illegitimate and undemocratic.
The March 12 rallies in Bangkok and in the rural north marked the beginning of a series of protests that are scheduled to take place this weekend.
The government estimated the crowd at 6,500 but rally organizers claimed they mobilized more than 30,000 people in the streets.
The Red Shirts have promised not to use violence in the rallies but this youtube video shows a scuffle between a Red Shirter and a motorist
The D-Day is still two days away but many Bangkok residents have chosen to stay away from the major rally sites.
Banks were closed; dozens of countries issued travel advisories against going to Thailand this weekend; and residents were told not wear red or yellow which are “politically charged colors” in Thailand.
The Yellow Shirts are supporters of the government.
Christopher Moore identifies the new media as alternative source of information about the situation in Bangkok
In Bangkok, at the best of times, it is difficult to get a static free signal.
In the worst of times, it is impossible.
There is too much noise rattling around inside the system.
TV and radio is still under the control of the government and the information broadcast is generally pro government.
But there is no longer a monopoly on broadcasting information.
The Internet, Twitter, cell phone text messages are running hot with information, rumors, threats, warnings, and fear.
The clash of messages has led to uncertainty and confusion.
What we have at the moment is fear, passion, anger, hatred and distrust.
The information and knowledge is being filtered through these emotions
Newley observes that no extraordinary event took place on March 12 in Bangkok
Many people here in Bangkok expected the day to be chaotic.
Businesses closed early.
Schools cancelled classes.
And while there were small demonstrations in some parts of city, it was largely a day like any other in central Bangkok.

tulsathit: "They expected thousands at each gathering point, but protest leaders only managed to gather hundreds at each spot," the source said
Richard Barrow @michael_sp34 I did not feel threatened at any time today.
In fact they were mostly friendly and keen for us to take their pictures.
Richard Barrow: They are saying many of the #redshirt pickups and buses are being stopped and searched by police checkpoints which is delaying them Hundreds of photos of the Red Shirts are accessible online courtesy of Richard Barrow.
Two separate tragedies struck Kampala, the capital of Uganda, on Tuesday: students at Makerere University rioted after the shooting death of two of their peers.
And the Kasubi Tombs, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the burial location of the king of one of Uganda's largest ethnic groups, burned to the ground.
Riots at Makerere University
According to Ugandan newspapers, the riots at Makerere University, Uganda's largest university, began after two students were shot dead and another critically injured by a security guard Monday night during a meeting about the current Student Guild elections.
The Daily Monitor reports two versions of the events:
Police say many students had gathered at the Hostel for the final leg of the Guild election campaigns when the watchman, suspecting one of the students could have intended to damage a vehicle in the parking lot, opened fire.
Earlier reports suggested supporters of Simon Kamau, one of the contestants in the guild presidential race, clashed with those of NRM's John Taylor, prompting the shooting of the Kenyan students.
The New Vision suggests the shootings were a result of a disagreement between one candidate and the supporter of another:
As the group prepared to leave, they were confronted in the compound by Nyongesa, who is believed to belong to the camp of John Kamau, one of the two Kenyans in the guild race.
He reportedly tried to hit Teira with a bench when the group rejected his calls to leave the hostel.
A brief commotion ensued, which, according to eyewitnesses, compelled the guard to fire the bullet that hit the three students.
Students responded on Tuesday by marching through Makerere University grounds, carrying signs and a coffin to protest the killings.
Both newspapers report that the protests turned violent and that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds.
Ole Tangen Jr, a journalist living in Kampala, was one of the first to blog about the Makerere riots.
He wondered why more students weren't using social media networks to spread the news:
Last night two Makerere students were shot by an armed security guard leading to widespread riots near the university today.
However no one thought to utilize Twitter to get the story out.
Searches for #Makerere all day on Twitter Search resulted in nothing more than news reports.
Is it ignorance of Twitter?
Is it the high cost of an internet connection?
What has led to this?
A Twitter search for "makerere" largely supported his claim, with most tweets consisting of links to newspaper articles.
Still, some Twitter users in Kampala were able to add some context:
@arthurnakkaka (18 hours ago): Gunshots being fired.
Or its tear gas? #Makerere
@arthurnakkaka (18 hours ago): Students screaming and running.
Situation getting bad #Makerere
@aspindler2 (18 hours ago): Demonstrations at Makerere Univ. Kampala uganda after shooting of 2 stdnts last night by security guard.
Police firing teargas disperse crwd @mirembe_maria (14 hours ago): The makerere University Strike has left two dead and one in critical condition, what is the way forward for the Government about all this??
Kasubi Tombs Burn
On Tuesday night, in an apparently unrelated incident, the Kasubi Tombs, the burial site of the kings of Uganda's Baganda ethnic group, burned to the ground.
The current king of the Baganda people has been in the news recently for his clashes with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.
In September 2009, the tension between the two led to deadly riots in Kampala, and citizens fear that the fire could lead to future unrest.
Ugandan blogger 27th Comrade writes:
Usually it is arson when a place like that burns down. They are made of grass thatch, the tombs, so the fire will be absolutely devastating.
Already, some f***wits around me are saying "Government!"
I'd be more-likely to say "Opposition!" But I guess it is more-likely some staffer who was careless with fire.
Let us wait for news.
Blogger and journalist Rosebell writes:
This relationship between President Museveni’s government and Buganda Kingdom is far from rosy and this has already given fertile ground for many to think there was some foulplay.
Many people seem to expect riots to breakout at dawn.
We only hope there will be a thorough investigation into the burning of the tombs and that no people will lose their lives and property.
This is crucial time for Buganda leadership too.
The Kasubi tombs are equally a heritage for the country so i hope both sides deal with this issue with maximum restraint.
Ugandans on Twitter are equally worried:
@daphnzempire (6 hours ago): kasubi tombs is on fire..oh my God where are we headed
@Kakazi (6 hours ago): Kasubi tombs burnt down about 2hours ago..
I honestly pray it wasn't arson!!
A great loss to our heritage..:-( @mugumya (6 hours ago): I fear there might be some kind of disturbance 2moro after Kasubi tombs are gutted in Kampala
Lauren, an American who formerly lived in Kampala, remembers taking friends to visit the tombs:
The Kasubi Tombs are more than important cultural and historic structures to me.
When we lived in Uganda, they were my neighbors.
Our apartment was at the bottom of Kasubi Hill, and we passed the Tombs every day to and from downtown Kampala.
We took numerous visitors to see the tombs to learn more about the Buganda tribe, its history and culture.
I always loved passing the guards of the Tombs; dressed in the traditional saffron-colored robe and leaning against the big tree out front, they waited patiently to greet the next set of visitors.

Santiago After the Earthquake by pviojo CC-By
As the day comes to a close, more videos crop up of the devastating 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile at 3:30 am.
The earthquake, which not only affected the mainland through the ground movements, also generated tsunami waves that set out an alarm throughout the Pacific as different nations prepared for the waves to hit their shores.
Some videos were made during the earthquake itself, as this amateur video found on YouTube.
It starts with a shot of a computer in a room, and as the earth moves the rumble of the earth can be heard, then the lights go out and we are left in the dark, hearing only the voices of a woman and a man we assume to be the one holding the camera trying to calm her down.
As daylight came, more people went out to the streets and recorded the damage they observed: Netprox drove through the highway, and had to squeeze under a fallen bridge to get through.
Rafael Vial also went out to the streets and recorded a collapsed bridge in Llaillay, Chile, which he streamed through his mobile phone on Qik.
At the exact moment of this post's publication, over 1,735,000 people had already signed a petition supporting the Ficha Limpa (No Criminal Record) bill, which seeks to prevent politicians who have committed serious crimes, such as misuse of public funds, corruption, murder and drug trafficking, from running in elections.
It may be hard for the international reader to understand why a law is needed to regulate something like this, but in Brazil, there are a good number of politicians in office with a criminal record.
For example, the Congressional Deputy Paulo Maluf, whose name recently made it to the wanted list of Interpol, for conspiracy and appropriation of public funds.
(Malufar is a neologism invented by Brazilians, a verb meaning "to steal public money".)
The goal of the campaign, which included Avaaz.org in recent weeks, was to gather 2 million signatures before today Wednesday April 7, the day the project is to be decided on in the Chamber of Deputies.
If approved in the Chamber, the bill goes to the Senate.
With the tagline "A vote has no price, it has consequences", the Ficha Limpa campaign was launched in April 2008 by the Movimento de Combate à Corrupção Eleitoral with the goal to improve the profile of candidates running for office in the country:
Calling for “national unity” in Concepcion’s main square on March 27, exactly a month after the devastating earthquake that hit Chile, President Sebastián Piñera announced “Plan Manos a la Obra” (Plan "Let's Get to Work") , an initiative of the Chilean government to reconstruct the country’s infrastructure and housing.
Two days later, on March 29, Piñera also announced a plan to provide a subsidy of US$2,543 each to assist 195,950 families.
In Concepcion, he explained that the necessary measures to reconstruct bridges, roads, ports, and airports were already underway.
He also announced that emergency health posts will correct the deficiencies of the health care system starting in April, and that emergency ferries and bridges in the Bio-Bio River will allow for the transport of heavy loads of materials and supplies to San Pedro de la Paz and Talcahuano.
Finally, the President highlighted a special fund that will distribute $8 billion Chilean pesos (US $15,107,160) through vouchers given to more than 200.000 families to provide them with construction materials.
Julio Segovia, a reader of the La Nación newspaper article that informed about this announcement, criticized the special fund for housing:
Colombian Presidential candidate Antanas Mockus, of the Green Party , sealed an alliance with the Medellín's ex-Mayor, Sergio Fajardo, who will be his Vice-Presidential running mate for the May 30, 2010 elections.
Both men were mayors of Colombian's two largest cities, Bogotá and Medellín, respectively.
Many Colombians believe that they led transparent administrations during their time as Mayors.
This alliance has been met with approval by many Colombians, as demonstrated in opinion polls.
However, the virtual world in blogs is also not alien from this.
Here are some reflections on how this alliance is seen online.

To begin, Álvaro Ramírez in the digital magazine EquinoXio writes about the importance of working as a team:
The Laguna del Tigre National Park - a critical reservoir of wetlands and tropical dry forest habitats - is currently threatened by human encroachment, out-of-control fires, and oil exploitation.
While the 25-year contract expired, the company Perenco Guatemala LTD is seeking its renewal, but environmentalists and activists are opposing to it strongly, organizing campaigns on Facebook and other websites.
On behalf of Guatemala, the The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) for Guatemala with the representation of the Environmental and Social Legal Action Center (CALAS for its initials in Spanish), filed an Environmental Submission before the Secretariat for Environmental Matters stating that the country is failing in the implementation of its protected areas and not respecting the laws with the extension of the 2-85 contract for oil operations in the Laguna del Tigre National Park in the Mayan Biosphere Reserve.

In other words, many are concerned about the destruction of the homes of many living creatures, as explained by the blog Guatemalan Birdwatching :
Guatemala has like 19 ecosystems, 300 microclimates, more than 37 volcanoes, rivers, lakes and beaches that are united in our ethnic diversity forming a destination of mystical magic and adventure.
Biological diversity has enabled Guatemala to stand among the 25 countries with the most variety of natural resources in the world.
Millions of species living in its varied ecosystems, more than 700 species of birds, mammals like the jaguar, tapir and a variety of reptiles and insects.
Savia, a school for learning how to respect and protect the planet created a video, where the story of the Laguna del Tigre is told and why they feel it is important to protect it (with English subtitles).
It is still uncertain whether he will extend the contract to the oil company, which may go against the will of members of his own Cabinet, as is the case with Luis Ferraté, the Minister of the Environment who is not in favor of extending the contract.
The park is considered a Scarlet Macaw Sanctuary for birdwatchers, and is one of the reasons why Guatemalan birding School blog expresses its concerns.
It is estimated that there are only 300 Scarlet Macaw families left in the Mayan Biosphere.
Dayamn shares the sad story of Poc Duck, now extinct:
Maybe it is a name most of the people in the world haven’t and will never get to hear.
This beautiful kind of duck became extinct a long time before a lot of us were even born.
It inhabited one of the biggest lakes in Guatemala. n 1966, the Ecologist Anne LaBastille started a campaign to save the duck from extinction but her efforts were in vain.
Her natural reserve wasn’t enough to counteract the damage we did to their environment and finally in the year 2004 after a study made by the UICN with the sponsorship of BirdLife International, the bird was officially considered extinct.
For the lake in Atitlan, the place where Poc duck disappeared the story is different.
Alan Mills points out that the lake did not collapsed overnight but it was the result of the irresponsible hippie-chic tourism development that took place there, and all the empty beer bottles and rubbish left behind by wild parties, neither improving the living conditions of the extremely poor people from the villages around, which did not increase the environmental friendly tourism.
For Guatemala Solidarity Network, the Lake is crying, too:
The writer, Aldous Huxley, famously wrote wrote of Lake Atitlán,"Lake Como, it seems to me, touches on the limit of permissibly picturesque, but Atitlán is Como with additional embellishments of several immense volcanoes.
It really is too much of a good thing." While, I’ve never been to Lake Como I have been to Lake Atitlán and it is stunning.
However, there is a fear that the lake is dying and will become marshland through man-made interventions.
These interventions include, for example, farming, tourism, and the lack and/or breakdown of public services to manage human waste.
While there are opinions saying that there is nothing left at the Laguna del Tigre National Park, archaeologists working in the region with communities clarified that a substantial amount of forest canopy remains intact within the enclave zone.
The governor of Petén regrets that they did not act before to protect our jungle.
However, it is not only about preserving the environment.
One of Laguna del Tigre's greatest treasures is a 2,500-year-old city of the ancient Maya world, called Waka´(500 BC) or El Peru.
It host among other treasures, the tomb of a Mayan Queen.
¿Que te pasa Guatemala? reported that CALAS filled a claim against the Ministry of Energy, who is in favor of extending the oil exploration contract in the middle of the rain forest.
The blogger Tokoloshte suggests visiting Laguna Lachua to be "industrialized" by the government (they will create a highway across the reservoir).
Manuel Boloma a young Maya Q’eqchi’ Social Anthropologist from the North (near the reservoir) strongly rejects the President's attitude and the apathetic role of people, doing nothing to rescue our future.
He saids that it is not an economy-environmental issue but rather the government distorted priorities, a suicide for Guatemala future.
He asks Guatemalans to open their eyes and see how they are destroying a valuable tomorrow.
The Shoaib Malik and Sania mirza wedding controversy has been an awakening for people on the both sides of the India, Pakistan border.
With the media blitz, it seems people of both the countries are witnessing a desi version of "papparazzi" as TV channels, print media and other agencies have hounded, gleaned and extracted any bit of information possible about this impending wedding.
Past skeletons have crept up on Shoaib in the form of his "ex wife" Ayesha Siddiqui, whom he had to officially divorce to end the controversy.
The allegations and the judicial case on him in India have now been taken back by the Siddiqui family for an alleged Rs. 150 million in alimony.
The twists and turns of the story have been pure mayhem for media and obviously the bloggers are not far behind.
The blogsphere in India and Pakistan have literally lit up with views and debates, some think its a sign of peace to come while others cite this marriage as a source for future acrimony.
Syed Zaki Ahmed at Pak spectator thinks that the marriage and the noise is good for businesses:
Now in this situation how could businessmen lag behind.
Businessmen in Pakistan have joined the party as they are getting orders for hundreds of thousands of T-shirts featuring Shoaib and Sania ahead of their wedding that is expected to take place next week on 15 April.
They call me muslim blog comments on the rationale behind the decision Sania Mirza took to marry Shoaib Malik:
What can Indian Muslims learn from Sania’s very personal decision?
It is this: never be apologetic about Pakistan.
Do not be needlessly cynical about that country out of fear of being dubbed a traitor.
You are not.
The Hindu right wing parties, from Bajrang Dal to Shiv Sena, did make a meal of Sania’s decision.
Yet, the bouncy tennis sensation took the plunge.
Why?
Simply because, deep in her heart, love for a Pakistani and being Indian need not necessarily be a conflicting experience.
However, Capricious thinks the marriage is going to fail:
* Sania Mirza got all the fame, popularity, wealth and iconic status in a very young age.
She became a darling of India, pampered and loved by all Indians and projected by Indian and world media.
She is a independent girl.
Unlike majority of Muslim girls of the subcontinent, she doesn’t need a husband for the bread and butter. The sense of providing livelihoods to the family is some thing on which man’s character, attitude and his authority develops.
It gives the typical Pakistani Muslim mediocre mindset.
This mindset always demands some thing extra and undue favor from the wives.
Which will be absent in the marriage.
The luxury of being “husband” could not be availed by Shoaib Malik.
Whilst every day brings new news like the Pakistani PM sending a special gift for the couple, the diatribe continues elsewhere.
Sunni Ulema Board, a group of religious scholars, reportedly issued a 'fatwa' (religious edict) against Sania and Shoaib for mingling freely and living together before the marriage is solemnized.
There has even been a term coined on twitter for this union with the hashtag #shoania
We have seen rumor mongering reports that the actual nikah (marriage registry) took place on the 9th of April.
But nothing is over until Sania and Shoaib say it's over.
It seems the media is feeding the mania and millions of people in both the country remain engrossed with all these.
Obviously this will continue till the 15th of April, as two very emotional nations watch a movie like story transforming itself in real life.
Last month, Sony Arianto Kurniawan or Sony AK from Mega Kuningan, Jakarta in Indonesia was threatened with a trademark infringement lawsuit by Japan’s Sony Corporation if he does not close his personal website whose domain name is www.sony-ak.com.
Thankfully, Sony the person was supported by the online community and Sony the corporation finally realized the folly of pursuing the case.
Sony Corp. has since then dropped the charge and has already apologized to the blogger.
The personal website of Sony AK was established in 2003 and it was awarded the best website in educational category for 2003, 2004 and 2006 by PC Magazine Indonesia.
Multibrand reminds Sony Corp. that the website of Sony AK provides only free information to the public and does not sell anything
In my humble opinion, Sony Corp. have been over confident in making the said demand, because protection given by trademark registration is limited to certain types/kinds of products covered by said trademark.
In this case, Sony Corp. is a manufacturer of electronics products, whereas the website: www.sony-ak.com is only a personal website of its owner that provides free information.
talking points affirms the popularity of Sony AK’s website in the past six years
This suit has upset many Indonesian onliners, especially those who have been blogging and are into IT for several years.
Sony AK’s site has been known for being the knowledge sharing center for IT enthusiasts in Indonesia, and has been up for approximately 6 years.
Website of Sony AK
Whispurr's Blog points out that there are many Indonesians named Sony
And mind you again, there are thousands of people here in Indonesia with the name Sony.
I have some friends with the name Sony, one of Indonesian Badminton star is SONY DWI KUNCORO, one of the most famous actor in Indonesia is SONY TULUNG.
Well then SONY CORPORATION, why don’t you sue those guys and thousands of Mothers who named their child with SONY.
finally woken wonders whteher Apple Inc. would sue actress Gwyneth Paltrow for naming her daughter Apple
Maybe Apple Inc. should sue Gwyneth Paltrow for naming her daughter Apple as she might have a blog called apple too in the future… Seriously this is beyond ridiculous.
Colson describes the issue as a battle between David and Goliath
The sympathy naturally is with David (AK) in his fight against Goliath (Corp).
Actually it is bizarre if an innocent citizen uses a name which remotely is the same as the one of a multinational, in a strictly personal context, is being sued for that reason only. Yet I'm afraid Goliath has a point here - because the legal system is to a large extent the product of the interests of the Goliaths.
And because the legal power Goliath is able to organizie is n-th time as huge as the limited funds a David has at his disposal.
Before the withdrawal of the case, bloggers were planning to launch a boycott campaign against Sony Corp. Yari NK is happy with the decision of the firm to drop the case It is wise for Sony Corp. to drop the claim since it does not make sense in almost any way that one has to stop using his own name for his personal non-commercial site.
By dropping the claim, Sony wouldn't hit the negative consequences in public opinion that, at worst, could lead to boycotting its products by the Indonesian public that backed Sony AK becuase they know that Sony AK had nothing but good intentions when he initially set up his blog or site and he is not eating into Sony Corp's profits....
Eleven Iranian bloggers and media professionals representing different parts of the political spectrum have answered a questionnaire about the changing dynamics of Iranian citizen media since the election.
Before the June 2009 presidential election the most dynamic pillars of citizen media in Iran were YouTube and blogs.
The election and the crisis that followed introduced Facebook and Twitter as two new primary channels of online citizen expression.
For a short time during the election, the Iranian government blocked access to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and several other websites.
Some, including one leading Islamist blogger , called it a miscalculated strategy that helped the Iranian opposition dominate in the virtual realm.
Despite the regime's attempts to filter social media websites, they became a powerful communication platform for the Green Movement.
So did the Iranian presidential election change the dynamics of citizen media tools and channels?
Are Facebook and Twitter the dominant players?
Are blogs gradually become a second hand channel for sharing ideas?
What are the channels political activists use the most?
I asked one leading Islamist blogger; three Green bloggers; one leading environmentalist blogger; five media people; and one active blogger, to participate in a short multiple-choice survey.
A group of eleven netizens could never represent the entire Iranian blogosphere, but it is a small step to gain insight.
1-Which are the sites you visit frequently since the presidential election?
Facebook was the favorite with six points, Twtter is at the bottom with one point.
Blogs got two points and FriendFeed and YouTube three each.
2-In your opinion which sites do political and civil society activists use?
Blogs are still king with six points, Facebook gets three points, you Tube two points, FriendFeed one, Twitter got zero, and None gets one point.
Six of our netizens believe the importance of the blogs after the presidential election did not diminish, two think blogs became more important, and three believe their importance was diminished.
Of the latter group, two think that blogs became less important because of Facebook's growing popularity, and one thinks the reason is that bloggers became less active.
3-What is/are the site/s you prefer to discuss your favorite topics:
Blogs are mentioned 4 times, Facebook, 6 times, FriendFeed 3 times and Twitter one time.
In sum, reading this survey shows that after presidential election Iranian netizens have gone more visual and that Facebook has become a place to be for many of them including political leaders.
The survey also shows that the so-called 'twitter revolution' (at least for our 11 participants) may have been more a phenomenon of western media than one of lasting consequence in the Iranian virtual world.
Blogs still remain a valuable place but are losing the ground to the newcomers.
Probably there is one certainty that after presidential election, nothing remained the same in Iranian community, the virtual as well as physical one.
On April 6th, Kyrgyzstan a mountainous country in Central Asia, was hit by mass protests which eventually led to the overthrow of the government.
Regional administrators were seized by protesters, and the army and police switched sides to the opposition, leaving President Kurmanbek Bakiev with almost no support.
The riots have not been bloodless - the recent unrest has so far left almost 74 people dead and more than 500 wounded - unlike a previous peaceful "Tulip revolution" in 2005.
The two uprisings are not dissimilar.
Only five years ago, it was Bakiev who came to the Ala-Too square in the center of Kyrgyz capital demanding the resignation of former president Askar Akayev.
Now, it is Bakiev himself who has had to flee the capital amidst roaring crowds led by opposition leader Roza Otunbaeva.
Kyrgyzstan cultural-political divisions, map source: Wikimedia
The roots of the present revolution are various: South vs. North clash (Bakiev is from the South, the rebels are from the North), corruption and suppressive government (in recent years Kyrgyz people witnessed all forms of oppression from closings of the newspapers to independent journalists' murders , Russia's Great Game interest, Ortega-y-Gasset'ian "revolt of the masses", etc.
Whatever the real reasons of the Kyrgyz revolution of 2010 are, it is important to note that it was overwhelmingly immediate, furious, bloody and... well-documented.
The role of the new media changed slightly this time compared to other dramatic events (like the protests in Moldova or Iran).
Blogs and Twitter didn't serve as serious means of public mobilization since the Internet penetration rate is relatively small in Kyrgyzstan ( just 15 percent in 2009).
However, new media were agile enough to cover all the main events giving detailed footage of initial protests in Talas, rampage in Bishkek and looting that followed.
At the same time, new media were efficiently used by the opposition attracting the attention of international community and shifting public opinion to the side of the protesters.
The opposition leader Roza Otunbaeva (@otunbaeva), for instance, registered her account as soon as she became the head of the provisional government.
On the other day, son of president Bakiev, Maxim opened a LiveJournal account to express the pro-government point of view.
Bloggers who both knew the region and were outside the country to see the big picture and collected the photographs, videos and Twitter confessions.
Two most informed bloggers in this situation were people outside the country: US-based Yelena Skochilo (a.k.a. LJ user morrire) and Kazakhstan-based Vyacheslav Firsov (a.k.a. lord_fame).
They managed to assemble the most complete collections of photos, videos and timelines.
Another "winners" in the coverage are the local blog-portals namba.kz, kloop.kg, issyk-kulpress.kg (as well as traditional news sites like internews.kg, neweurasia.net and 24.kg), forum diesel.elcat.kg and a wordless webcam showing Ala-Too square (its screenshots were captured and transmitted by many bloggers).
Twitter hashtags #freekg (the major hashtag of the event), #bishkek, #kyrgyzstan and #talas, although filled with re-tweets and various provocations, made it possible for English-speaking audience to follow the events as well.
Despite nation-wide problems with the Internet on April 6 and 7 (the government forces blocked several popular websites "Azattyk" (RFERL), 24.kg, ferghana.ru, LJ user sabinareingold reported), the Kyrgyz revolution came out to be very well-documented.
Registan.net, comparing the events with Andijan massacre, wrote:
The information coming out of Kyrgyzstan is not always reliable.
It is often biased, short-sighted, confusing and contradictory.
But it is giving us a view of Kyrgyzstan that demands our attention — not only now, but in the months and years to come, when we look back on these events and try to piece together what happened
Since the information was so vast, so there was a systematized list of events and materials gathered and published by the bloggers.
April 6th, Talas
The revolution began on April 6 in Talas , north-western Kyrgyzstan, where the local people stormed the local administration.
The same happened in Naryn a couple of hours earlier.
On the next day, almost all regional capitals except Bishkek in the North of Kyrgyzstan were controlled by the opposition.

April 7th, Bishkek rampage
The most important events happened on April 7 in Bishkek.
The opposition meeting turned to an open conflict.
When protesters (who somehow acquired arms) started to storm the Presidential palace after defeating police forces, the presidential guards started firing at them in an attempt to stop the attackers.
Witnesses said several snipers killed at least 20 people (others were killed by grenades and open fire).

Video of the storm:
Another video:
The police was unable to stop the protesters and left the building.
President Bakiev left for the unknown location on his plane.
On April 8, there was information that he landed in Osh (south of the country), and moved to his native village near Jalalabad.
He refused to abdicate.
The Osh region is among those that aren't controlled by the opposition so far.
It is still unclear what will happen to Bakiev.
April 8, Revolution aftermath
After the opposition forces won Bishkek, they confronted another serious danger: the looters.
Various bloggers reported omni-presence of looters (sometimes armed).
In the evening, the looters were stopped by newly established police and volunteer brigades with white bandage on their hands.
The last messages from the blogs said that the situation in Bishkek stabilized.

In early March, observers watched as around 20 long-time Christian orphanage workers were expelled from the country they called home.
The incident, and others which followed it, have brought to light the debate surrounding Christianity in the Kingdom.
While the official Moroccan line is that 98.7-99 per cent of the population is Muslim (the remainder being approximately 1% Christian and 0.2% Jewish), that statistic includes ethnic Europeans residing in Morocco.
Proselytizing is illegal, as is conversion away from Islam.
Still, foreign Christians are allowed to practice freely, and a number of churches, mostly from the era of French colonization, remain.
In contrast, the country's tiny Jewish population is almost entirely native, and is also allowed free practice of their faith.
Despite guarantees of freedom, it would appear that the government is taking a stronger approach of late to proselytism, both real and perceived.
The Moroccan Dispatches shares a recent incident in which an Egyptian Catholic priest was expelled from the country:
Evangelicals have operated for years in Morocco, with their main purpose being the conversion of Muslims.
Catholics have operated for longer, but purposefully have not engaged in proselytizing.
So it came as a surprise that a Catholic priest was also detained and then exported during last week's crackdown.
The blogger shares a message he received from a Catholic priest working in Morocco:
On Sunday the 7th of March, five minutes before mass began; the police in the city of Larache entered our friary and arrested one of our confrères, Rami Zaki, a young Egyptian friar still in initial formation who was spending a year with us.
He was ordered to go with the police, had no possibility to collect anything, and was given no explanation for his arrest... ...When Rami was put on the plane, his passport was taken from him and given to the pilot who later surrendered it with Rami to the police in Cairo.
He was detained by the police in Cairo for another seven hours for interrogation before he was permitted to telephone his community of friars.
From Sunday, the morning of his arrest, to Tuesday afternoon, when he was released – a total of more than 50 hours – Rami was deprived by the police in Morocco and Egypt of any of his human rights.
In another post, the blogger demonstrates that the public has joined in the crackdowns, citing a recent incident in which a cross was removed from its site of many years:
Where a cross once hung in Meknés
This is the place where a cross used to hang in Meknes' medina.
The Catholics who teach Moroccans languages and career skills in this building do not engage in proselytism but have caught up in the anti-Christian sentiment following the recent expulsions of Christians.
Last week, the cross was knocked down and beaten into pieces.
On a positive note, Moroccans who have benefited from their services have volunteered to reconstruct the cross.
In a more recent post, the same blogger assesses a TelQuel article on the situation, and says of it:
In the main article, it points out that most Moroccans convert to Christianity more as a result of Arabic media and not from foreign missionaries.
This jives with my experience: a number of Moroccans I know have had long conversations with Christian missionaries about religion and none have converted.
Some defended Islam while smoking hashish just to piss off the Christians, it that gives you an idea of how many Moroccans understand their Islamic identity.
This observation about foreign missionaries, of course, undermines the rationale behind the recent expulsions of many foreigners.
To conclude, the blogger notes the recent media crackdowns and laments:
Other media critical of the government have been shut down recently.
And the same could happen to Tel Quel.
But as long as they are still around, there will be at least some debate and critical thinking about current events.
The blog translation project High Peaks Pure Earth has recently focused on "music with a message" by translating the lyrics of Tibetan songs from music videos that have been uploaded onto the internet.
On March 10 this year, the blog presented a hip hop video titled "New Generation" by the popular group known as "Yudrug" in Tibetan ("Green Dragon" in English).
Yudrug had first released the video on their blog the previous month.
According to High Peaks Pure Earth:
This bold new style of musical expression heard in "New Generation" has been quite controversial in Tibetan cyberspace, with Tibetan bloggers praising Yudrug for their outspoken lyrics, but some also criticising Yudrug for adopting a style that is seen as “too western”.
Whatever your musical taste may be, the song is undeniably powerful and energetic with a rousing chorus:
The new generation has a resource called youth
The new generation has a pride called confidence
The new generation has an appearance called playfulness
The new generation has a temptation called freedom
Indeed Yudrug's "New Generation" is a demonstration of an upsurge in online activity by and about Tibetan identity, as described by an earlier blogpost in High Peaks Pure Earth.
The music is full of pride and confidence.
Here is the video with English subtitles:
"New Generation" by Yudrug (Green Dragon) from HPeaks on Vimeo
Apart from Yudrug, High Peaks Pure Earth also introduced a young Tibetan singer, Tashi Dhondup, to its readers.
Tashi Dhondup is from the Amdo area of Tibet and is currently serving 15 months of re-education through labour for "crimes" related to his music.
His 2008 CD "Torture Without Trace" sold out in thousands in Tibet.
Below are his music videos:
"Unable To Meet" by Tashi Dhondup from HPeaks on Vimeo.
"For That I Shed My Tears" by Tashi Dhondup from HPeaks on Vimeo.
"Torture Without Trace" by Tashi Dhondup from HPeaks on Vimeo.
"No Regrets" by Tashi Dhondup from HPeaks on Vimeo.
In his customary funny style, Sead Dzigal provided a list of similarities between Facebook and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY):
Facebook - social networking
CPY - socialist networking If you are not a Facebook member - you are a nobody
If you are not a CPY member - you are a nobody Everybody on Facebook are your friends, even though you don't know half of them.
In the CPY everybody are your comrades,* even though you don't know half of them.
On Facebook you support various actions and causes without lifting a finger.
In CPY you are a member of a zillion committees, boards, assemblies, without lifting a finger.
On Facebook you've got FarmVille,
in CPY you've got zadrugas and land reform. On Facebook you've got "Like,"
in CPY you've got "Long live comrade...!!!" Facebook - often invading your privacy,
CPY - often invading your privacy.
.aNTI reacted through a comment , using a phrase often attributed to Vaclav Havel:
This post is filled with cliches and anti-communist propaganda.
The only thing worse than the communists are the anti-communists.
Recenzent agreed, and trying to prove wrong the current anti-communist prejudices about how things changed, he noted :
The media used to be run by the political party.
Today they can be pro-government or anti-government, but are still run by political parties.
You can get a job much easier if you are a political party member. Regardless if it was CPY, SDSM or VMRO-DPMNE.
He also noted that passive "support" for various actions remains a staple of current political parties too, as well is fighting dissenters using conspiracy theories.
* The words friend and comrade are synonyms in most South Slavic languages, such as Macedonian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian...

Today's announcement that the Polish presidential couple killed in the tragic aircraft accident over Smolensk last Saturday would be buried on Sunday at 2PM in Krakow's Wawel Castle raised a lot of controversy.
Lech Kaczyński's family was given a choice of three burial locations: the Wawel Castle in Krakow, as well as St. John's Cathedral and the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.
Stanisław Dziwisz, the Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow, announced today that they had decided in favor of Wawel, and this announcement later sparked a series of public protests.
Some 400 protesters gathered in front of the Metropolitan Curia of Krakow tonight to voice their concerns: the authorities' failure to consult with the nation; the fact that Wawel is a resting place of kings, military leaders, representatives of the Polish literature and other historical personalities considered heroes of the nation; the fact that none of the spouses of the heroes resting there had been buried along with them.
The protest was organized through several Facebook groups, such as this one (currently 2,143 fans), this (23,369 fans) and this (11,782 members).
Nearly 1,400 people have signed this online petition related to the protest as well.
The scale of the protest on Facebook did not go unnoticed in the Polish mainstream media .
To understand the sentiments of the protesters, let's look at some of their posts on Facebook.
Maciej Sadkowski expresses the dominant opinion of one of the groups opposing the decision :
Not only that suddenly the person everyone laughed at suddenly becomes a national hero, now this...paranoia...maybe we should bury , and others in Wawel, too? they died as well...
Paula Rettinger believes that the president's place is in Warsaw:
I protest against the burial of in Wawel.
Brother of my grandfather died in Katyń.
As well as my mother's uncle.
The topic is close to my heart.
The only reason to call Kaczyński a hero is his accidental death.
It's an irresponsible, foolish decision taken under the pressure of a constant propaganda flow of condolences to the deceased couple.
The Warsaw Cathedral is a necropolis for presidents, and it is where the president should rest.
Izabela Wójcik refers to the image of Poland abroad:
I also oppose it, as all my friends I've talked to.
But it is not only our internal matter because now the entire world will see how after a short period of unity the Polish nation divides and argues again.
Try to look at this image: the cortege with guests from all around the world and a demonstration in the back of it.
How will it look like to the world?
Why multiply conflicts with decisions of this type?
Eh...
Piotr Tomula points out the past sentiments of the Kaczyński family towards Krakow:
He did not receive the honorable citizenship of Krakow, so now his brother pushes him in through the back door for even more, this is exactly how the duckies , NO HONOR, only VANITY...
Kuba Bielecki speaks with irony:
If my family decides where we should be buried, I will tell my brother that I want it to be Wawel, but hand in hand with Sobieski, well actually Mickiewicz would satisfy me, too.
Agata Kol is one of the few voices supporting the decision, though:
Kaczyński was a head of state, just as kings from the Piast or Jagello dynasties.
He was also chosen democratically.
Gazeta.pl posts a survey on the topic, asking the public for their opinions.
Here are the current results (as of 11PM):
What do you think of the plans to bury Kaczyński in Wawel?
63% Should be buried in Warsaw
26% Brilliant, is is exactly his place 11% It does not matter, his family should decide
Piotr Kowalczyk's tweet sums up the general direction of the discussions:
Wawel will not unite the Poles, but divide them.
On the night of the 3rd of April 2010, the leader of the Afrikaans Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), an Afrikaner resistance movement, Eugene Terre'Blanche, was murdered.
This has happened in the time when issues of race relations are hotly debated following the singing of 'kill the boer', an old apartheid activist song, by the ANC Youth leader, Julius Malema.
Let's see what digital citizens in South Africa are saying about his death and the future of race relations in the county.
From the Old has been following the entire fiasco so far and here's what he's posted on the South African Scouts Association: "Statement by the Verkenners Beweging van Suid-Afrika about the murder of Eugene Terreblanche"
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A ROUGH TRANSLATION FROM AFRIKAANS TO ENGLISH, PROPER VERSION WILL BE UPDATED IN A FEW MINUTES.
The Scouts Movement of South Africa has learned with sadness of the brutal murder of the elderly Eugene Terre'Blanche.
Mr. Terre'Blanche devoted his life in bondage to his people whom he loved had. It is sad that his life was lost, for his bondage.
It is instructive to note that the murders are less than a month after Mal-emma the first time the commission had sung "shoot the farmer."
This follows two days of court order against Malema and can rightly be asked whether this court order an influence on the killing of our uncle Eugene.
Whether there is a connection between the death of the communist Hani Paassaterdag in 1993 and the murder of Uncle Eugene Paassaterdag in 2010 for the Scouts Movement irrelevant.
The fact is, a vulnerable elderly farmer in his bedroom on barbaric way with sticks and PanGas beaten to death and the regime of the day, the climate created for this genocide being committed against our people are.
The link between Julius Malema's provocative statements and the Murder of Eugnene Terre'blanche is a consistent theme when looking at the list of blog posts on the subject.
DBS on MyDigitalLife calls the event a big opportunity:
The murder of Eugene Terreblanche is a big opportunity for South Africans.
This is a great opportunity to take a big breath and show the world that we are able to be sensible, think before opening mouths and talk to each other before doing anything physically rash.
The hatred stirred up by different leaders in the past months is not good for the country.
Let us use this man's death as a turning point to reconcile ourselves to the different views of the people in the country rather than lying the blame with someone singing a song.
Can we do that?
Yes we can!
Will we?
Well sadly I suspect not.
Obviously having a bone to pick with the AWB.
KickMugabeOut hopes the former AWB Leader suffers eternal torment.
He does cover the story with some very interesting pictures and comments.
One of the pictures shows a guy wearing a T-shirt with the old Apartheid flag as well as an Israeli flag on a fence.
South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, has made a statement on the murder of Eugene Terre'Blanche.
One is covered here by the Times Live Blog.
And another perspective on Jacob Zuma's statement by From The Old:
Today Jacob Zuma will speak to South Africa at 2pm.
He will most likely tell South Africans to forget about the event and that we should move on, however many claim this is not possible and that the boers are under attack.
Jacob Zuma also said today that "South Africans not to allow agent provocateurs to take advantage of this situation by inciting or fuelling racial hatred”.
However he seems to forget that in the past few weeks white South Africans have been constantly attacked by Julius Malema that cant seem to stop the racial hatred and blaming of white people.
From The Old also covers another statement, this time by the AWB, claiming the murder was political:
The AWB came forward and said in a press conference that the murder was in fact political and that they will retaliate against Julius Malema whom they believe is the cause of the murder.
Julius Malema in the last few weeks incited hatred against white Afrikaners and Boers by insisting on singing the "kill the boer" song.
As tensions grow in South Africa just as the World Cup is heading this way.
In under two months South Africa will hold the biggest sport event Africa has seen while polarization and racial tensions are peaking.
Continuing on this line, Common Dialogue asks, "Is Terre Blanche’s blood on Malema’s hands?":
Eugene Terre Blanche died a violent death allegedly at the hands of his farm hands.
Is this as a result of Malema singing “kill the boer”?
Terre Blanche was allegedly hacked and bludgeoned to death on his farm near Ventersdorp, in the North West province, allegedly by farmworkers during an argument over R600.
Emotions are inflamed with some rightwingers even threatening to avenge the killing.
The question is just how “miraculous” was South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy?
And just how dangerous are the racial utterances by people like Malema and other politicians who are fond of racial political posturing?
From The Old, covering many aspects of the case on his blog, says this yet again from the AWB's perspective agreeing with a perspective revealed on Facebook:
"The BWB sympathizes with the family of Eugene Terreblanche and wants to point to the fact that this deed was politically motivated by Melama as revealed on Facebook"
White farmers all over South Africa are still under attack, now one of the biggest known boers have been murdered on his own farm because of a wage dispute allegedly.
Many find it hard to believe that a normal pay dispute could lead to the death of Eugene Terreblanche the leader and founder of the AWB.
Eugene Terreblanche is said to not sleep at his farm at all and the fact that it came out that he was "sleeping" also brings up more doubts about the reality of what happened.
Whether or not this is politically motivated is another story, a white farmer employing black people on his farm gets murdered.
The first thing that comes to mind is the song the ANC is so desperate wants to get unbanned.
The same song Julius Malema was gagged not to sing but continues to sing in Zimbabwe despite court orders.
Tony Lankester puts up his opinion in "What Would Malema Do?":
So Eugene Terreblanche has been murdered.
And although it is probably unrelated, the fact that it happened while the country debates the appropriateness of struggle songs like “kill the boer” is going to put the whole debate in stark relief.
And while it is unlikely that a tubeless rendition of the song inspired anyone to put a bullet into a sleeping Mr Terreblanche, it will be interesting to see what Julius Malema does next.
Will he back down and stop singing it?
Will he publicly condemn the murder and say that actually doing it is not what he meant?
Or will he stick to the principle he’s been holding forth and sing it at the next opportunity?
FliMflaMfLiK argues that instead of focusing on "kill the boer" the song, and we should focus on this facts: "Terreblanche = White Earth":
Everyone seems to be focussing on "the song" but nobody is looking at "the facts".
Getting knickers in a twist is what people do best and what they should be doing is sitting back and looking at the logical:
1
They were 16 and 21 respectively - very young.
2
They did not run, they waited for the cops.
3
They were angry about not getting their monthly salary of R300.00 each (shocking).
4
Apparently Eugine treated them very badly in the past (this I can well believe).
He had threatened to kill them before.
5
Given the above, could these young lads have thought (in their minds), that they were acting in self defense?
Just because Eugine was famous, it's an issue?
These young men may not have known anything about any song in their parts.
We don't know.
Perhaps it's wise to wait and see what other facts present themselves?
And finally, in a satirical twist, Azad Essa uses the Terreblanche event to pick apart issues and stereotypes in the South African Muslim Community in his post on Thought Leader "Was Terror’Blanche a Muslim?"
Overall, one of South Africa's leading figures of the "Afrikaner Resistance" movement has been put to rest in violent circumstances.
Tunisian bloggers used to avoid expressing themselves in English (the third language in the country), writing in Arabic (sometimes in Tunisian dialect) or French instead.
This has, in some way, limited their foreign audience and hindered the access to their thoughts and opinions to non-Arabic and non-French speakers.
But lately some bloggers are using English in their posts.
Here's a look at some of the blogs in English.
In his post entitled:AlJazeera.net inaccessible in Tunisia , Amin Zayani exposes the controversial censorship of AlJazeera.net: Tunisians can watch Al Jazeera freely whereas the website is censored.
He writes:
You switch on your TV and satellite receiver in Tunisia and you can watch Aljazeera, Aljazeera English, Aljazeera Children, Aljazeera Documentary, Aljazeera Live, Aljazeera Sport all day.
But you type the web address in your browser and you can not access it.
Strange, isn't it?
Under the title: Tilikum The Killer Whale, Foetus.me jotted down a small story about freedom:
Remind ‘em who you are.
Remind ‘em how free and wild you really are.
These people forgot you’re the apex predator of the oceans.
Don’t bear with them, they dreamed of power, wicked as they see it, food related and cruel.
Tell them that true power is to respect others freedom and build up on that.
Show them that they are responsible and accountable.
Nature will prevail my friend.
Amor blogging his world wrote a post about China's new rules concerning the media coverage of the conflict with Google:
A new set of rules and instructions from the Chinese government itself suppresses China media outlets from reporting almost anything about Google’s recent pull out from China.
The instructions, nabbed by China Digital Times, outline a series of rather disturbing edicts to media outlets that are covering the Google story.
While this is nothing new, the Chinese government’s broad and suppressive mandates are still striking.

Sula7fet, an English language student and a newcomer to the Tunisian blogosphere shared with us extracts from a book he read :
The Paranoid Style in American Politics by Richard Hoftasadter , when reading the title I first thought that the issue s discussed in the book will be mainly addressed to the American reader , I remember taht i took a moment , hesitated for a while , and then asked how much ?
Hopefully, this new linguistic orientation towards the use of the English language, will give the Tunisian blogosphere a new fresh breath and will introduce it to readers from all over the world.
Moscow's Monday morning routine was broken today by two subway suicide bombings , which took the lives of at least 38 and wounded at least 70 people (many victims were students, aged below 40).
The suicide explosions were carried out by two women allegedly affiliated with the North Caucasus rebels .
Bloggers were among the first to spread the word about the tragic event, becoming the only stable media while major news websites stopped responding due to high traffic and TV channels were too slow to prepare any material on time.
As Twitter user Krassnova noticed , Twitter hashtag #metro29 had 40 tweets per second while TV channels managed to prepare just 4 stories.
In less than a couple of hours a website metro29.ru has been installed to cover the events.
One of the first bloggers to tell the news was Marina Litvinovich (aka LJ user abstract2001), an opposition blogger, who posted photos from Lubyanka subway station , where the first blast occurred:
Temporary information and transportation collapse followed.
As terrified Muscovites started to check if their friends or relatives were alive, cellphone network in the centre of Moscow went down.
LJ user offnet complained that one of the reasons for the cell phone network blackout was a bureaucratic routine that required mounting an extra re-translator cell stations even in extreme situations.
Habrahabr user rubyrabbit made a complete log of the major news website blackouts.

TV channels were not only slow but have also been accused for the lack of adequate attitude in their coverage of the event.
Another popular blogger, Anton Nossik (aka LJ user dolboeb), wrote :
The World Cup will kick off in about three weeks and bloggers across the Levant have already been busy using their keyboards and camera shutters trying to capture the hysteria that engulfs the world once every four years.
Syrian and Lebanese national teams have never qualified to the World Cup finals, yet that does not stop people from being hardcore fans and showing their admiration to their favorite teams in any way possible.
While Lebanese blogger Rami from the +961 blog was content with certain aspects of the football fever, he was not impressed by some of what his compatriots are doing.
people are getting those mini flags for their cars and balconies, it might seem silly but it’s cool as long as it makes people deviate a bit from the political discussions.
Still, it really is pathetic when you get a flag that is more than 1 meter in width or length!
I’m pretty sure you could have put that spent money for a better use!

From Syria, Nasdaq on the other hand was occupied with analyzing the different reasons people get behind a certain team, highlighting religion as a factor:
You're a girl, so it's only normal that you're cheering for Italy.
When my nana (grandmother) was young, she also cheered for the Italian team and they were even more handsome than they are now according to her.
And Independence '05 blog , from Lebanon, publishes more photos of the "flag industry" that flourishes due to World Cup:
Flags for sale in Beirut - Courtesy of Independence '05

And like the others, she dwells a little on the reasons of the somewhat excessive expressions of excitement for world cup, but reaches the same conclusion:
the result?
It's FUN FUN FUN.
Mozambique relies on money from other governments that give aid directly to its State Budget, making possible essential services like health and education.
The relationship between the "donor" countries, and the Mozambican government, which has remained in the hands of the strong ruling party, has had its ups and downs over the years.
And the donor countries are diverse, from Europe, North America and Asia, and they have rarely acted with a unified voice.
Since the late 1990s, most donor countries have repeatedly demanded proof of improvement in "governance" - in what relates to corruption, improvements in accountability and the rule of law.
These demands were made concrete in written agreements between donor countries and Mozambique.
The murders of two high profile figures investigating corruption in 2000 and 2001 continue unresolved in the eyes of donor countries.
The recent trial of managers of Mozambican Airports, a state enterprise, for embezzlement of millions of dollars of state monies reminded that corruption continues to occur at a high level.

Yet, it is safe to say that, until Sweden decided that it would reduce its support to the Mozambican budget last year, most of the tension between donor countries and the receiving government remained behind closed doors.
Additionally, last year's presidential election also elevated public tensions, as donors challenged the administration of elections.
Joseph Hanlon, long-time Mozambique analyst, journalist and Professor at Open University, offers up a full section on his website documenting the "donor strike" of 2010.
He summarizes
Budget support donors (G19) sent two letters to government in December 2009, demanding rapid moves on electoral law reforms, corruption, conflict of interest, and the overlap between the Frelimo party and the state.
Budget support was suspended.
On 5 February 2010 Aiuba Cuereneia, Minister for Planning and Development and the main government negotiator with the donors, sent a reply to the G19, setting out the government position and making few concessions.
Negotiations in early March led to an agreement announced 24 March and a resumption of the flow of money.

Nelson Mandela Source:www.ambassadors.netMany people know that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years of his life in a prison on Robben Island in South Africa.
What most people don’t know is that Madiba (as he is affectionately known in South Africa) spent 67 years in the fight against racism and poverty.
South Africa’s former President will turn 92 on Sunday, 18 July 2010.
For the past 16 years, South Africans have been celebrating Madiba’s birthday with fervor and enthusiasm.
In 2002, however, Nelson Mandela himself used this day to launch his global HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention campaign, 46664.
In 2009, the success of the 46664 campaigns and celebrations evolved to what is now known as “Mandela Day”, a day in which people around the world dedicate 67 minutes to making the world a better place for all.
The organisers explained:
It was decided that there could be nothing more fitting than to celebrate Madiba’s birthday each year with a day dedicated to his life’s work and that of his charitable organisations and to ensure his legacy continues forever.
2009’s Mandela Day was a roaring success in South Africa.
So much so that 2010 will be the first Nelson Mandela International Day as Joburg reports:
It will be the first Nelson Mandela International Day, as the United Nations passed a resolution on the day in November 2009, declaring 18 July an international day set aside for humanitarian activities.
It is the first time the organisation has dedicated an international day to an individual, recognising him as a symbol of hope for those who are oppressed and marginalised.
Although the day will be celebrated worldwide, Madrid, in Spain has been chosen as the host of the first official Nelson Mandela International Day celebration concert, at which BB King is billed to perform.
New Yorkers will also host its own celebration concert.
Staying with New York, an installation celebrating the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela was put on display in Grand Central Terminal in New York in honour of Mandela Day 46664.
The installation features six illuminated 3-D action words: act, listen, lead, unite, learn and speak.
The front of each word shows key messages that reveal Nelson Mandela’s values and inspire visitors to act.
The Nelson Mandela Foundation reports:
In Italy, the Firenze City Council, in conjunction with the Mandela Forum, have arranged for a video about Mr Mandela, the movie Invictus and Mandela Day, to be aired at the Mandela Forum as well as at an open air cinema in Florence.
The Firenze City Council has committed to supporting Mandela Day and encourages all citizens of Florence to get involved in the global movement for good by signing a resolution in support of Mandela Day.
Mandela’s call to action was also heard by Cuba:
The Foreign Relations Commission of the Cuban parliament agreed today in an extraordinary meeting to commemorate every July 18 as the International Day of Nelson Mandela.
South Africans have also heeded the call to spend 67 minutes of their day to improve lives in the country.
Activities have been set up around the country whereby people may volunteer their time.

A blogger at Hope Blog says that we should not consider Mandela Day a holiday:
Each of us can make a small difference and our collective efforts can truly change the world.
Nelson Mandela Day is not a holiday – it is a day for all of us to all come together through action.
Help us to share Nelson Mandela’s vision of a better future for all, take action this weekend, and tell us about it on our Facebook Page.
Need some inspiration?
Our staff will be sharing their individual volunteer efforts for Nelson Mandela on Facebook as well, and here are 67 ideas on how to change the world.
This is how farm workers in Stellenbosch, South Africa, will honor Mandela Day:
Farm workers in have urged volunteers to spend 67 minutes with them on Sunday, in celebration of International Mandela Day.
The group "Women on Farms" has set aside a piece of land for unemployed female workers, giving them a chance to put food on the table.
The initiative aims to alleviate gender discrimination within the agricultural sector.
Tanzanian blogger, Simba Deo, emphasises the value of self-sacrifice:
It in giving that we receive
In loving that we are loved
In sacrificing that others do sacrifice for us
Self sacrificing for others is key to improving peace, sustaining development, sustaining freedom and justice.
The opposite would be seeking for personal glory.
Whatever we do, we should do it because we believe in it and that it is for humanity and not for personal glory.
Dorin and the Bush Warriors Clan want us to honor Mandela by protecting wildlife and the environment:
The amazing things Nelson Mandela has done reaches far beyond humans, as he has done many things for wildlife and the environment as well.
Much like his dreams for human rights, Nelson Mandela has also dreamed of African wilderness being unified in peace across many countries.
He once told National Geographic journalist, Peter Godwin, “I dream of an Africa which is in peace with itself…I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent.
I dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all our great wildernesses.
We must never forget that it is our duty to protect this environment.
Transfrontier parks are a way we can do just that.”
We recently brought you the story about his plan to save southern Africa’s elephants with the implementation of Elephant Corridors.
It is through his involvement with his organization, the Peace Parks Foundation, along with Sir Richard Branson, Mike Humphries, and Virgin Unite that this dream will become a reality.
There is also “Bikers for Mandela Day” – a group of 21 motorbike riders (and Morgan Freeman) who are on a six-day road trip around Cape Town in spread the word about Mandela Day.
And if you’re still not convinced, have a look at this passionate plea by The Elders
Madiba said on his last ever international visit in London, June 2008:
It is time for the next generations to continue our struggle against social injustice and for the rights of humanity.
It is in your hands.
Market in Luanda by Flickr user BRamirez37, CC
The Roque Santeiro Market, a name that comes from the famous Brazilian soap opera that was a hit among the soap-opera crazed Angolans, is known for being the biggest open-air market in Africa, for transacting thousands of dollars a day, and for being the main stage for the sale of every imaginable product.
Fortunately or unfortunately, the market’s days are numbered.
The Luandan government plans to move the market from the Sambizanga to Panguila, located nearly 30 kilometers to the north of Luanda.
The date has yet to be decided.
The Roque Santeiro Market was established in its current venue in the 1980’s, at a time when the country was still beaten down by war and provisions were scarce.
Initially designed like the Boa Vista Market, the commercial area was perhaps the only location where it was possible to find a little bit of everything – albeit through hidden means, including guns and arms trafficking and both adult and child sexual services.
Currently, the Roque Santeiro Market is means of survival for many Angolan families.
At the same time, the market is also a haven for criminals who have given the commercial area its bad name.
In an old article, taken from the blog entitled Angola Drops, the Brazilian blogger describes the market:
The recent assassination of a woman by the alleged father of her baby, and a promising young Brazilian goalkeeper, has been on the media spotlight, shocking the country for the level of violence involved in the crime.
At the same time, Instituto Sangari , a non profit for social awareness on scientific culture based in São Paulo, published its 2010 Map of Violence in Brazil stating that 10 women are assassinated everyday in the country.
Inevitably, the blogsphere put the two together and condemnation of such crimes became a hot topic beyond the sensationalist broadcasting of mainstream media, which has been limited to the footballer's crime.
According to Nilcéa Freire, minister of women policies, violence against women is in fact largely ignored by the media :

A plagiarism scandal broke out in March in Chinese academic circles when Nanjing University literature professor Wang Binbin charged that Wang Hui's dissertation on Lu Xun -Resistance to despair - contains a number of passages lifted from other books without citation.
(More background information from Granite Studio and ChinaGeeks)
Wang Hui is honored as the spokesperson of the Chinese "New Left" intellectual circle and in spite of the scandal, in May he was nominated by Tsinghua University and successfully received a scholarship award from the highest government authority, the State Council.
While Wang Hui kept silent and expected the matter to be “clarified within the academic community”, many scholars and public intellectuals have commented on the issue via local media outlets.
Some defended Wang Hui; some pointed out that the dilemma is one of non-standard citation rather than of intentional plagiarism; some have suggested a thorough investigation be led by an independent academic committee.
The whole debate has mainly taken place within the local academic circle and online public sphere until very recently (July 7) when a local media outlet (ifeng.com) disclosed a joint letter signed by "an international community of scholars, translators, editors, historians and cultural critics" in support of Wang Hui.
Backup from international academic community
The open letter, signed by many prominent western scholars such as Tani Barlow, Arif Dirlik, Gayatri C. Spivak and Frederic Jameson, frames the plagiarism charge as an "attack from the popular media in China" and defends Wang Hui's academic integrity:
The charges have been contested and discredited in the careful analyses given by Zhong Biao, Shu Wei, Wei Xing and others.
Among the signatories to this letter are also translators and they are without doubt closest to the work of Wang Hui.
Each translator has checked and double checked all the footnotes in the vast bibliographies of Professor Wang's publications over the last thirty years.
None has found any indication of plagiarism no matter how loosely this word is defined.
Second, among us are many Asia specialists in Chinese studies and we attest to Professor Wang's scholarly integrity and his importance in international Asian studies.
Interestingly, the two accounts of Zhong Biao and Wei Xing, quoted in the letter, were set up for the purpose of this debate but quoted as if the two individuals were well-known public intellectuals.
In addition, their “careful analyses” have yet to clear Wang Hui of his technical mistakes.
In Zhong Biao's article, he explains the background of Wang Hui's book and criticizes Wang Binbin's unreasonable charge:
The state broadcaster CCTV revealed in June 28 that China is expected to receive 8 trillion yuan ($1.18 trillion) in financial revenue by the end of 2010.
Such figure will turn China into the second-largest country in terms of revenue income after the United States.
It seems that China has realized its dream of being a strong country, however, netizens have been rather skeptical about the news because of the uneven distribution of wealth.
"Great Leap Forward" in financial revenue
Online current affair commentator, Hou Jinliang, says that such kind of "Great Leap Forward" is unbearable.

I was a bit sad when I saw the bold headline at Modern Ghana website yesterday; “Rawlings Homeless”.
Jerry Rawlings is the former president of Ghana.
I became totally shocked after reading just part of the story. In February, 2010 an intense fire described as "rapid and fast" razed to ashes the residence of former President Jerry Rawlings with nothing to salvage from the debris.
The fire was said to have started at about 0420GMT during a heavy rain characterized by intermittent power cuts.
While no life was lost, the disaster left behind “the depressing spectacle" of the ruins of a house which firemen had tried in vain to salvage in three hours.
The fire burnt nearly every valuable item and by the time the fire service personnel were done putting out the inferno; everything was down to ashes except the concrete walls and pillars.
According to the Modern Ghana website Ghana's former president and his wife are homeless and urgently looking for an accomodation to rent in Accra.
It is also reported that the former president had to travel from a “small village house” at Tefle in the Volta Region to Ghana’s capital; Accra for meetings when the needs arise whiles his wife is currently putting up with her mother at the Nyaniba Estate residency; a situation which is affecting their marriage.
According to the former first lady, Nana Konadu; when their Ridge residence got burnt on February 14, 2010; government promised to find an alternative residential facility for them but 5 months later, that promise from government is far from being fulfilled.
She also complained that the Ridge residence might have been saved from the fire if the house had a constant flow of water because when the fire fighters arrived, they had little water in their tanks and thought they could get some more water from the house.
Let's look at the opinions of Ghanaian bloggers and their readers on this issue.
Obed Nanayaw Sarpong does not understand why the former first family wants a new house from government:
Earlier last week, the former first lady, Nana Konadu Agyemang Rawlings granted an interview to Joy fm in Accra in which she spoke widely about how her family life has been affected after they lost the ridge residence.
I couldn't help laughing.
I hated that my almost 5-month old prophecy that the former first family would demand a new residence from government, and the people of this country, was coming to pass.
The rest, we all live to see.
As a country, we should wipe off the letters in the constitution that give those 3 or more houses plus cars etc to people who have served this country.
My opinion is that if they love this country well enough like I do, they would allow those monies to be used in ensuring the people of this country get good and safe drinking water, a place to 'ease' themselves (if they get to eat at all), schools etc.
Things they couldn't provide while they had access to the resources to do so!
Mike reacts to Obed’s post saying:
So they lost their Ridge residence?
Why not live at their Adjiringanor house?
What about the one off the Volta River near the Sogakope Bridge?
They don't own those anymore?This is why I'm excited about Ghanaians blogging.
Those that are full of crap will be noted.
If Rawlings had a blog in 1978, 1979, we would have evidence of what drove him to power and what he stood for.
The hypocrisy in some ranks has hurt the country and apparently is still crippling us.
Obed Nanayaw Sarpong responds to Mike's comment:
@Mike, they say the house is not completed-there is a 10m high wall around that residence.
The wife says Mr. Rawlings lives at the Tefle residence and it's a challenge for them.
I get disappointed when these men and women shamelessly want to feed on us
Ghana’s Most Irreverent; Ato Kwamena Dadzie says, "Get a mortgage, Mr. Rawlings":
Almost everything Mrs. Rawlings said in that interview seemed calculated to deceive Ghanaians into thinking that her family was in a very dire situation and to force the hand of government to do her bidding, knowing very well that she had rejected government offers of alternative accommodation.
I foolishly fell for her trickery.
I sat on radio and said government had no excuse for its failure to provide the Rawlings’s with alternative accommodation – five months after something (or someone) set their house on fire.
I wasn’t alone.
Others were also incensed and government had no choice than to come out to quickly rebut her claim that nothing had been done yet to provide her family with a home."
With that, one question was foremost on many Ghanaian minds.
“Ah, Rawlings paa,” one man asked.
“After 19 years in power as a dictator, is he saying that he hasn’t built a house for himself?”
Ato advises Rawlings to go to Ghana Home Loans to get a mortgage:
That’s just about as far as we should go.
It’s a good salary Rawlings gets.
If his East Legon mansion is not fit for his royal revolutionary habitation, he should go to Ghana Home Loans and get a mortgage.
Last time I checked, his son, Kimathi works with Fidelity Bank.
They also offer mortgages.
He should go and take one.
George Bush’s retirement home was not provided by the American government.
Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are living in their own homes.
So is Kufuor.
It’s not beyond Rawlings to move into his own place.
He’s even lucky that his so called “village house” in Tefle is on the banks of a river.
Gordon Brown would kill for that.
If you become president of this nation, take a monthly salary and several other perks that make it virtually unnecessary for you to use your own money and you can’t build a house of your own and you turn around expecting the state to provide you with accommodation upon retirement, then you are nothing but a big fool.
There were 40 readers who have left comments at the time of writing this post.
Following are some of comments readers have left:
Banske considers Rawlings the most deceitful and laziest Ghanaian:
Hmmmmm!!!
Kwaku Baako says Rawlings is the luckiest Ghanaian and it's true and in addition I say he is the most deceitful and laziest Ghanaian.
For those of you who continue to be fooled (if is real or pretense)by the rawlingses, now that their hypocritical acts are exposed,don't you agree that he is the worst personality to have surfaced on the Ghanaian political scene?
What is he doing with the money sitting his swiss account?shameful imbecile.
He who burns a house will be consumed by fire!!!!
Anna G says:
To me, it doesn't make sense at all for the little taxpayer’s money to be used to provide accommodation for ex- presidents.
In the first place, where were they sleeping before they became presidents?
Look at the ridiculous things that Kuffuor proposed that should be given to him when he became e- president.
To me, they are all the same: selfish, because they know very well that the tax that is collected in this country is not enough.
If our politicians and leaders continue to be this selfish, then I’m afraid Ghana's bad economy will never recover and we will continue to be a third world poor country.
Frank Anderson supports Ato's position:
Ato I couldn't help but absolutely agree with you.
I find no sense in using tax payer's money in building houses for ex presidents simply because they have once been heads of state.
It sucks and pathetic.
And this issue has dominated public discussion for weeks?
Jesus Christ!!!
It is the cliche of African leaders.
Even young guys at the ages of 23yrs begin thinking or taking steps to build their own homes how much more a former president.
The Rawlings' should save themselves this embarrassement and complete their own home.
Kweku Diyifo says says this is self-deception:
When I first heard Mrs. Rawlings say on radio that they are looking for a place to rent, I asked myself, "What kind of self deception is this?" After staying in power for 20 years?
After paying GHC90,000 import duty on two cars, instantly?
After getting friends to pay for their children's education aboroad?
The list goes endless.
Many Ghanaians would even believe, and rightly so, that the Rawlings have more than the two mansions they have struggled to admit they have.
I know from my little experience in business that, with their kind of influence both home and abroad, it would take just a phone call for the Rawlingses to acquire a respectable and appropriate freehold residential accomodation anywhere in Ghana.
If you have and say that you do not have, that's your own problem.
But I, and many like me wont be fooled.
Sero summarizes the whole issue in one word:
....in one word,rubish
Sokari writes about a racist World Cup Ad by German car rental SIXT: "The above advert was sent to me by a friend from Germany which she explains as follows: It is playing various eurocentric, afro-pessimism clichés in relation to the coming Ghana/Germany soccer play."
On Tuesday July 13th, the blog of Le Nouveau Courrier , reported that they received an unexpected police visit after publishing that morning the first installment of an in-depth series that was to last the whole week on alleged corruption in the cocoa and coffee trade in Côte d'Ivoire (see original in French here).
they had not seen such methods used by the authorities in Côte d’Ivoire for many years.
The theft charge does not stand up.
It should be borne in mind that protection of the confidentiality of sources is a fundamental principle of journalism, one that is particular appropriate for such a sensitive issue as corruption in the coffee and cocoa trade.
In the Facebook group some colleagues have pointed out that the first article in the official Code of Ethics for the Ivorian Journalist published by the Ministry of Communications (see original in French here) states the rights of journalists in Côte d'Ivoire:
Since Buddhism is a state religion guaranteed by the Constitution and the fact that nearly all Cambodians are Buddhists, the recent reported decline of monk morality in the country is a cause of concern.
On several occasions, monks have been found of engaging in violent behavior or misconduct including having sex or watching pornography.
There was a case where a provincial chief monk reportedly got drunk and beat a clergymen who didn't file a complaint for security reason since the bully monk is recognized as the king monk in the province.
Recently, a monk was caught making a video of naked ladies who went to his monastery for religious watering, a belief that the water provided by the monk will release all bad incidents or bring luck to people.
The investigation which led to an arrest was followed by an enormous sharing of that nude video via bluetooth from phone to phone.
This apparently raised a question over the emerging development of technology infrastructure in Cambodia where people can widely access porn materials more easily.
However, as suggested by Chan Nim, the issue is left to the conscience of the people on the proper use of technologies.
On the other hand, there are many well-behaved monks who understand the role of technology in promoting religious teachings.
While it is now common to see many blogs initiated by young people who discuss social, technological or personal issues, there are now Buddhism-themed blogs such as Bodhikaram, Saloeurm, Khmerbuddhism.
An extensive teaching of Buddhist philosophy is now accessible online in the form of short commentaries, dictionaries, podcasts, or textbooks in both English and Khmer.
Moreover, there are a number of monks who are effectively maximizing the internet in order to reach a wider audience.
Venerable Saloeurm Savath, for example, has been rigorously sharing many Buddhist teachings via face-book which acts as a natural linkage with his laypeople who can easily reach him for more explanation on certain Buddhist Principle or issues.
Pagodas and monks are part of Cambodia's cultural and educational heritage.
They continue to contribute a lot in society.
It is hoped that monk morality can be strengthened to encourage the people to affirm their trust and faith in Buddhism which has hugely contributed to national reconciliation and psychological peace, such as the case of survivors of the Khmer Rouge Regime that kept applying Buddhist teachings to transform their revenge and anger to hope and peace of mind.

Shortly after the recent harassments incidents in Lebanon, the term "The Rule of Dinosaurs" started to be used by cyber-activists in their campaign against this invasion of their cyberspace.
Lebanese blogger Tony explains what it means in his post entitled "How to Tame Dinosaurs": “الديناصورات” هو اللقب الذي أطلقه بعض الناشطين اللبنانيين مؤخراً على أقطاب السياسة والأجهزة الأمنية في لبنان بعدما تركوا كل مشاكل البلاد وتفرّغوا لقمع الحريات وكمّ الأفواه واقتحام المسرحيات ومنع الكتب والأفلام السينمائية واعتقال الناشطين وممارسة العنصرية ضد الأجانب. اللقب هو على سبيل المزاح طبعاً، لكن إصرارنا على إسقاطهم لا يدخل أبداً ضمن إطار المزاح، بل هو ضمن إطار التراجيديا التي لا مفرّ لهم منها. “الديناصورات على أشكالها تقع” هو عنوان معركتنا
"The Dinosaurs" is the name given by some of the Lebanese e-activists to the politicians in Lebanon recently.
This came after they left the country's real problems to focus on suppressing freedoms, silencing people, banning books, plays and movies, arresting activists and being racist against foreigners.
The name is a joke of course, but our determination to bring them down is definitely not a joke, it is inevitable.
"Dinosaurs of a feather flock together" is the title of our battle.
The largely under-reported food crisis in Sahel has taken worrisome proportions as about 2.5 millions of people in Niger are currently affected by food shortage.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has decided to scale up emergency operations to protect the population at risk. Bloggers in Niger reflect on yet another food crisis after the one in 2005, a food crisis this year that is the result of shortage of rainfall last year.

D. Evariste Ouédraogo wrote the following about they way politicians always try to spin food crises in Niger in a way that would put them in a more favorable light :
Niger is a country of contrasts.
Rich in newly found uranium and oil but its people crushingly poor.
Food is readily available in the market – but at an inflated price few can afford.
Families are selling off their livestock at reduced prices to buy food.
Mohammed Gusnam was one of these people: "It is difficult.
As herders we were like princes, proud.
Now the pasture land is disappearing and we are stuck in the village.
The village is like a prison to me."
The current response to the food crisis, however, seems to be speedier than in 2005.
Cyprien Fabre, head of the regional bureau of the European Commission Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) offers the following assessment :
David Ajao discusses Nigerian president Facebook page: "Through a Facebook page opened on 28th June 2010, he has systematically been sharing his belief in Nigeria and his dream for Nigeria."
Nigeria is not a country known for its responsive leaders. High-level politicians rarely engage with the electorate, and it's commonly complained that the voice of the people goes unheard.
But newly-confirmed President Goodluck Jonathan may be changing that: a few weeks ago he opened a Facebook account, and two days later reversed a controversial decision after hundreds of fans posted disappointed reactions on his wall.
The decision in question followed on the heels of the Nigerian national football team's dismal performance at the World Cup.
After their elimination from the tournament, Jonathan announced the team would be suspended for two years while plans were carried out to eliminate corruption.
"The problem of Nigerian football is structural," the President's communication adviser told the press.
"There is need to withdraw from all international football competition so that we can put our house in order."
But many fans were displeased with the news, complaining that the suspension was unfair.
I read your comments and took them into account in the government's decision to rescind the suspension of Nigeria from International Football.
I had a meeting with the NFF today and conveyed my disappointment and those of Nigerians on this page and received assurances that there will be positive changes ...
FIFA, the international body governing football, also disagreed with the suspension, and gave the President a week to reverse it. Jonathan's decision to reinstate the team fell exactly on the deadline set by FIFA, leading many to wonder if it was the powerful football organization – rather than the Nigerian people – that made him change his mind.
SolomonSydelle writes:
This now gives the impression that Jonathan bowed under pressure to an international sporting organization.
That perception can be harmful for Jonathan who only has a few months in office before presidential elections...
Furthermore, the snafu between Jonathan and FIFA raises questions about the behavior of the football agency, which challenged the decision of a sovereign leader in an avoidable way.
Venezuela's Hugo Chavez famously joined Twitter in April; Chile's Sebastián Piñera tweets, along with his entire cabinet.
But the question remains whether leaders will use platforms like Twitter and Facebook interact with their constituents – or merely as one more way to disseminate an already-fixed agenda.
Nigeria is approaching an election year and it is anticipated that Jonathan will want to stand candidate; popular moves like joining Facebook and reinstating the Super Eagles may merely be a ploy to win over support in advance of the election.
“Is this not another play of words? is this not another design to flatter Nigerians?” wrote My pen and my paper.
For Mr. President to go back on his decision looks to me like an attempt to throw his words around for the sake of speaking.

Palestinian refugees are one of the biggest displaced populations in the world, with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) providing assistance for some 4.7 million registered refugees in the occupied Palestinian territory, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
Millions more displaced and emigrant Palestinians live around the world.
However, their attachment remains strong to the home they, or their parents or grandparents, left behind.
Two bloggers in Gaza have written about the pain of exile.
Earlier this week the Libya-sponsored aid ship Al-Amal ("hope") attempted to sail to the Gaza Strip (but was forced to change course for Egypt).
In Gaza, blogger Kalam was thinking of someone he wished were on the ship: هي هلا التي لم تكمل سنتها الأولى في الحياة بعد، ولكنها تحمل بالوراثة كل مشاعر الفلسطيني المغترب، فهي ابنة للاجئ لم من يرى من أرضه شبرا واحدا طوال حياته، ولأم تعيش مشتتة الفؤاد بين الوطن والغربة بين الأهل والزوج بين الأم والبيت بين الأخوة والأبناء، فعقلها وجزء مهم من قلبها هناك وأهلها وبقية قلبها وذكرياتها هنا.
She wears a prayer scarf and holds prayer beads between her hands, and asks God – or maybe she is just doing what she has seen her parents do when things get tough for them – she appeals to God to make real her wish or more accurately her grandmother's wish to see her and hug her and kiss her.
This is Hala, who has not yet completed her first year of life, but she carries the inherited feelings of every Palestinian exile.
She is the daughter of a refugee who has seen not a single inch of his land his whole life, and of a mother who lives with her heart split between her homeland and a foreign country, between her family and her marriage, between her mother and her home, between her siblings and her children.
Her mind and an important part of her heart are there, and her family and the rest of her heart and her memories are here.
Hala Kalam continues: هلا تنتظر وكلها أمل، أمل أكبر من السفينة الليبية القادمة إلينا هنا، والتي كم تمنيت أن تكون معهم لأقبلها، حين يصلون سأرى في كل واحد منهم جزء من صورة هلا، وسأسألهم لماذا لم تأتوا بـ هلا معكم؟؟؟!!!
Hala is my young niece who lives in Libya and cannot come to Gaza – which has become everyone's focus these days.
Praise God and ask him to allow her to come to Gaza… She is unable to come because of the difficulty of getting residence in Libya, which means she cannot be sure of returning there where her father who is a displaced person – he does not have an identity number – and the rest of her family are.
Hala is searching for someone to say, "Welcome to your country", and is searching for someone to put her in reach of the affectionate embrace of her grandmother, who adores any picture of her or any video clip in which she appears.
Hala is waiting full of hope, a hope larger than the Libyan ship coming to us here, which I have wished so much she were on so I could embrace her; when they reach I will see in every one of them a piece of Hala's image, and I will ask them why they did not bring Hala with them.
Also in Gaza, Kawther Abu Hani listens to her mother reminisce: "I would love to know what happened to our small house which we left in Nazareth years ago… What do the hills look like now?
And perhaps the scent of thyme has changed… How old my friends have grown, and I have become just a story for their children… Goodness me, I didn't even attend their weddings.
I wanted to live through the stages of my life with them, and most of all I was waiting for the day on which we would learn about love and forget about games, when we'd fall in love until we became depressed.
Oh dear, but the worry of love is not like the worry of occupation.
Now I remember…" She is always remembering.

Rwanda's strides to build a regional ICT hub:
Rwanda has positioned itself as a regional hub for information and communication technology (ICT) with a robust ICT industry, including e-commerce, e-services, applications development, and automation.
It is believed that ICT will be harnessed to generate wealth and be a key economic driver.
As part of its policy goal to progressively transform Rwanda from a predominantly agriculture economy to a predominantly information-rich, knowledge-based economy (PIKE), the Government committed itself to the implementation of the envisaged four rolling NICI/ICT4D Plans over the 20 year life-span of Vision 2020 and the ICT4D Policy.

There were fears that the administrator may have passed away without the knowledge of his followers:
Mukiza I have this feeling that the anonymous admin for this page may have silently met his or her creator without our knowledge.
For what explains the fact that this page has gone non-updated since august of 2009.
That is a hell of a long time for a live person to be that un-responsive.
If my worries are founded,then my sincere condolences are guaranteed.
The administrator joined the discussion explaining his silence:
Paul Kagame Still kicking, I'm afraid ;)
I recently moved cities and have been largely without the internet for the past 3 months as well as splitting up with my partner of over a year.
I'm sorry for neglecting you, but I still check in whenever I can.
Unfortunately even admins are human.
If anyone has any complaints all they have to do is make a topic and I'll see it.
As for the page, well it seems to take care of itself pretty much, or so it seems to me.
But I'll do some spring cleaning.
But maybe I've grabbed the wrong end of the stick here, is this a coup?
Would the community like me to step down? :) ~ The Administrator
Kagame supporters are also on the popular microblogging site, Twitter.

Regulating internet content today is viewed as an anti-democratic practice but Southeast Asian governments seem able to justify it by invoking the need to save the young from the scourge of indecent sexual behavior.
Indonesia’s plan to filter web of “bad” content through its Multimedia Content Screening team was shelved last February after it was opposed by the public.
Today, the proposal is being revived in the wake of a celebrity sex tape scandal which continues to shock both the young and old in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation.
After enacting an anti-pornography law two years ago, Indonesia now wants to enforce an internet blacklist in response to the demand of conservative voices to protect the morals of the young.
A similar celebrity sex scandal hounded the Philippines last year which paved the way for the passage of an anti-voyeurism law.
The internet was also blamed for the instant dissemination of the sex tapes which prodded lawmakers to craft a cybercrime bill.
In Cambodia, the government is proposing to establish a state-run exchange point to control all local internet service providers which is intended to strengthen internet security against pornography, theft and other cybercrimes.
The draft regulation is not yet final but it is expected that the government will seriously pursue this measure especially after it recently became almost helpless in stopping the cell phone and internet uploading of an illegally taped video of nude ladies bathing in a monastery.
Southeast Asian governments do no always need sex scandals to censor the web since they can always cite other reasons, like national security, to filter and monitor internet content.
For example, Thailand became the first country in the world to shut down 100,000 websites for containing “dangerous” material.
It punishes bloggers, writers and website administrators for violating the lese majeste law.
Vietnam was accused by Google and McAfee of launching cyber attacks against some websites, specifically websites that advocate opposition to bauxite mining, a controversial issue in the country.
But politically-driven internet regulation often encounters strong opposition from internet users and it always elicits condemnation around the world, especially from media groups and human rights organizations.
Governments can always ignore the noisy critics but they will also lose credibility.
Governments with democratic trappings cannot afford to censor the online media for an extended period.
But regulating the web to stop pornography and other immoral acts somehow generates only a whisper of protest.
It has become the safest ruse to block “harmful” websites.
Myanmar’s internet regulation policy has been identified as one of the draconian measures imposed by the ruling junta but its decision to ban two weekly journals for posting photos of female models in short pants didn’t draw the normal level of opposition from democracy groups.
The aggressive drive to eliminate sex and sexual imageries in the online domain may be a symptom of the rising tide of conservatism in many Southeast Asian nations.
The morality card is being played to produce desirable attitudes, sentiments and behavior among the population even if this strategy disrespects the diverse cultures in the region.
When Indonesia passed the anti-porn law, the Bali governor protested since the law is contrary to the local tradition where making historic nude statues and erotic dances are sometimes still popular.
When Cambodia blocked websites showing pornography or sexy images, it included reahu.net for containing artistic illustrations of ancient bare-breasted Apsara dancers and a Khmer Rouge soldier.
Another problem is the vague definition of what constitutes images and actions that are pornographic, indecent, immoral, and obscene.
Filipino activists are worried that the cybercrime bill would now make it unlawful to publish or upload materials that contradict the official state interpretation of what is decent, moral, and proper.
Governments have mastered the tools and techniques of censorship in the traditional media.
They are now testing the limits of online regulation.
Indonesia’s plan to enforce an internet blacklist should be monitored because of its impact in the region.
Indonesia has more than 40 million internet users and it is acknowledged as the Twitter capital of Asia.
If Indonesia succeeds in filtering web content, other countries in the region are expected to follow this model.
Web censorship does not only cut access to information; it also weakens the power of internet users to form online solidarities.
To really protect the young and innocent, the best solution is to give them, their parents, and the community in general, the proper education and relevant information about the potential and risks of surfing the web.
On December 18, 2008, millions of Thai mobile phone subscribers got this text message from the newly installed Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva:
"I, Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Prime Minister, realized that you fellow citizens are suffering, and are under stress.
Therefore, I'll concentrate in exerting all my knowledge and ability to help the country.
But I can't succeed if Thai people are not together in harmony.
So I beg you all a chance."
sms from the PMAccording to Democrat Party officer, the text messaging was an idea of Abhisit himself, and was coordinated by Korn Chatikavanij, the country's Finance Minister.
Korn allegedly called Thailand's three major mobile phone operators, AIS, DTAC, and True, for a cooperation to send out the message to their subscribers.
The meeting for cooperation was held in December 16, one day before Abhisit Vejjajiva got officially appointed to be the Prime Minister.
And the reason for requesting for 5-digits postcode is to evaluate the demographic of those who replied.
The subscribers will then be listed in a database.
Sending a text message to a person without the person's consent is considered a violation of a consumer's privacy rights, said consumer rights advocate Saree Ongsomwang.
She said Abhisit should opt to keep contacts with the people via television and other public communication outlets in order to avoid infringing on the consumer's rights.
Saree, who is also part of the committee of the Telecommunication Consumer Protection Institute, added that under Thai telecommunication law, mobile phone operators are not allowed to release the list of subscribers without their consent.
When the three mobile operators sent the controversial text message to their subscribers, free of charge, in behalf of the Prime Minister or the Democrat Party, it brought some legal and political complications.
Under the 1999 Anti-Corruption Law (amended 2007), state officers, including cabinet members, cannot receive any gift or benefit that is worth more than 3,000 Baht.
It is estimated that the sending of the Prime Minister's text message cost more than 10 million Baht.
Abhisit could be charged in the courts, as argued by Pheu Thai Party spokesman Prompong Nopparit, urging the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) to investigate the case.
If Abhisit and Korn are found guilty, they will be impeached and suspended from holding any political position in accordance with the Constitution.
Comments in the Internet were quite mixed at that time.
In general, many agreed that this may be a violation of privacy and personal data, and the Prime Minister doing too much PR on media.
But at the same time they feel that if it's a good intention, it should be ok, and he should have a chance to work for the country.

On July 16, 2010, NACC has again postponed its ruling on the case, and did not yet set a date for the handing down of the final decision.
Soccer fans gathered in bars and restaurants around the globe to watch the final game of the World Cup last night.
In Uganda, these celebrations were interrupted when bombs exploded at two popular nightlife spots in Kampala, the country's capital.
Ugandan media are reporting over 40 deaths so far, with dozens more injured in the explosions.
Ugandan police have suggested that Somali militant group al-Shabab was behind the attacks.
One of the group's commanders recently called for attacks against Uganda, which contributes troops to the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia.
The group has praised the attacks but has not claimed responsibility.

Ugandan blogger Gay Uganda writes:
Uganda attacked.
Really, it is humanity attacked.
Who has the gall to be happy at such atrocity?
Apparently, Somali insurgents are happy.
Because they are fighting African Union troops in Somalia, who have stopped them from establishing an Islamic state under Sharia law. ....What I see are country mates, human beings who were doing nothing worse than watching a football match who were killed and maimed, in the name of ideals that they may have no real thought about, actions that they cannot control in the least.
Ernest Bazanye cautions against jumping to conclusions about who set off the bombs too soon:
It’s too early to say who is responsible or why, and even though it is whispered abroad that it was a pair of suicide bombings staged by Al-Shahab, the Somali terrorist organization.
We should know by now that the truth doesn’t get here that soon and that any conclusions now would be premature.
Trevor Snapp, a documentary photographer living in Kampala, was at Mulago Hospital, where many of the victims were taken, after the bombings. He writes:
Family members milled around the front reception area while doctors and bodies covered in blood were rushed in and out of surgery.
In the surgery hallway a man’s body lay in the floor bleeding by his head, it was impossible to know if he was dead or alive.
A few feet away in a small storage locker, staff had created a makeshift morgue, 6 bodies lay on the tiles, some had their clothes blown off.
They were all young.
Many bloggers are shocked that the bombings happened in Kampala, widely known as one of Africa's safest capital cities.
Joshua Goldstein, a former Global Voices author who used to live in Kampala, describes the locations where the bombings took place:
Kampala's Rugby Club is a sprawling bar, adjacent to the pitch, where many of Kampala's college students come to hang with their buddies.
If Uganda had fraternities, this is where they would throw their parties.
Here the smart set drink Nile Special with reggae and hip hop blasting in the background.
On weekend days the same crew watch rugby, collars popped to block the sun. ....Across town Ethiopian Village, down the street from the American Embassy, is in the dead center of Kabalagala, the Las Vegas of Kampala.
The restaurant, the most high end of the half dozen or so Ethiopian restaurants within 500 meters, sits at the intersection of Ggaba Road and Tank Hill Road.
In the afternoon, Ethiopian dissident journalists pass their exile by chewing miraa and discussing the day's news.
At night, the neighborhood lights up with bars and dance parties.
Sleek writes:
To give this a little perspective, I’ll point out that up-til now, Kampala has been one of those places where at 03:00 AM, one can walk from one end of the city to the other.
And that we are the kind of people to complain about rising fuel prices, high Pay As You Earn taxes, impossible airtime charges…basically a very high cost of living.
But in all this, we’ll still go to that new hangout place and pay UGX 5,000 for a beer.
And we fill the place to the point that you literally have to fight your way to the bar to get a drink.
And that’s the average hangout.
And then you hear about bomb blasts...
There’s no doubt that crime is a blot on South Africa’s achievements since the dawn of democracy in 1994.
It is a matter that affects all South Africans, irrespective of where they live and who they are.
Therefore, it came as no surprise that the trial and subsequent conviction Jackie Selebi, former national police commissioner and ex-president of Interpol, would draw a great deal of attention.
As reported by Bloomberg:
Judge Meyer Joffe found Selebi, a former president of Interpol, received hundreds of thousands of rand in payments between 2000 and 2005 from three businessmen, including murder suspect Glen Agliotti, that “made no legitimate business sense” and were intended as bribes.
Selebi was also accused of having links to a syndicate that trafficked people, drugs and stolen goods, according to the charge sheet.
The conviction ended an investigation of almost 5 years by the now disbanded, elite crime fighting squad in South Africa known as the Scorpions.
South Africa’s former president, Thabo Mbeki was accused by some of dragging his feet throughout the process.
It would ultimately take a further 2 years and a lot of political fallout before Mbeki was prepared to formally charge his top cop.
This prompted many to ask why South Africa’s National Police Commissioner was being protected by his president.
The saga elicited many opinions and even further questions from all corners of South Africa.
South Africa’s opposition parties also hailed the conviction as a positive development.
The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance highlighted however:
The outcome of the Jackie Selebi corruption case is certainly a positive development, because it demonstrates that not all senior ANC politicians are above the law.
However, the case must in retrospect serve to highlight two particular issues: firstly, the essential role that was played by the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions), which was controversially disbanded last year, in instigating investigations of politicians; secondly, the chronic failure of the ANC's policy of cadre deployment.
Some, like Ray Hartley are skeptical:
Selebi’s conviction is, on the face of it, strong evidence that the criminal justice system is once more showing its steel when it comes to crimes by senior political figures.
But it is not quite so simple.
Selebi is yesterday’s man, a Thabo Mbeki appointment who no longer enjoys the political protection offered by those in high office in government and the ANC.
Pierre de Vos also sheds light on other matters arising from this trial:
The conviction must place a question mark over the actions of former President Thabo Mbeki, who appointed Selebi, at first took steps aimed at protecting Selebi and claimed that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Selebi even after Mbeki was briefed by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) about the evidence against the former top cop.
Why was Mbeki so adamant that Selebi should not be arrested?
Why did Mbeki ask us to trust him on Selebi and why did he maintain – in the face of overwhelming evidence provided to him – that there was no evidence to suggest that Selebi was a crook?
Why did he appoint this guy in the first place?
Does it not show- at the very least – a spectacular lack of judgment on the part of our former President?
Sarah Britten expressed similar sentiments:
The Selebi conviction is another nail in the coffin of Thabo Mbeki's credibility
Iluvsa asked:
The most pressing issue facing this country today in the wake of the Selebi trial and his conviction on corruption charges is this: who will follow him down to jail?
Even more pressing is this: who will bring that political bigwig to trial?
Perhaps that is the most pressing issue now.
South Africa's fledling democracy is at risk of failing if the issue of corruption is not addressed.
The country's justice system has shown that it can work if there is political will.
Pierre de Vos once again asserts:
Political will is key to fighting corruption.
If we see more high profile cases of private and public corruption brought to court, we will know the Zuma administration is serious about stamping out corruption.
If we do not, we will know that it is rotten to the core.
There is a group of Cape Verdean citizens who occasionally organize meetings in Lisbon to discuss the relations between youth and politics, as Suzano Costa explains in a video republished by Amilcar Tavares.
In their blog - Tertúlia Crioula - one can read the notes taken from "Cape Verde in Debate" as well as other discussions on important issues.
Indication that China's economy is close to second largest in the world came today with the release of Japan's growth figures for the second quarter.
Where's all the money going, Sohu economics forum member BRY seems to ask in this post from last week, "Why do Chinese always save so much?", starting first by comparing the health care systems of Australia, Sweden and Thailand with that of China:
More than 70 Iranian university graduates and academics are calling for the release of Hamed Saber, an Iranian photo-blogger and computer scientist who was arrested for unknown reasons on 21 June 2010 in Tehran.
A friend has informed us that it was the first time Hamed was arrested.
The same source said several of Hamed's photos of the Iranian protest movement have been published in foreign magazines without his knowledge.
Hamed is also the developer of "Access Flickr", a Firefox internet browser extension that bypasses filters on the photo-sharing website Flickr in Iran, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, China and other locations where it is banned.
One of Hamed's friends posted a letter in a discussion forum on Flickr seeking support for Hamed:
As some of you might already know, it has been nearly a month since Hamed Saber our dear friend and artist and the founder of Iranian group on Flickr has been arrested for no apparent reason.
There has been no news of him except for two telephone calls from an anonymous place.
A group of his old friends, university class mates and professors from well-known universities around the world have issued a letter requesting Hamed’s release.
All of us know him for quite a long time, since our first days of membership in this group or maybe in trips we went together with him.
Many of us started photography in Flickr and specifically this group and even made life-long friends here.
I myself feel indebted to him for finding many artist friends here and in this group.
Today he is imprisoned for no clear reason and this is an opportunity to show our friendship and appreciation.
I thought we could write a letter or statement and defend his position as an artist and an old friend and ask for his release.
I am not that good at writing, any comment or idea or any suggestions for a solidarity gesture by anyone of you can be of help, so drop a line in the comment my friends , we have to take action as soon as possible.
Hamed's friends on the "Free Hamed Saber" blog wrote :
Saber, the winner of a Bronze medal in an international science competition, had the possibility to emigrate but he preferred to stay in Iran and work for its "independence and economic progress."
The statement calls on Iranian leaders to give Saber a fair trial.
While the recent WikiLeaks experience reveals aspirations to build "information freedom zones" with some help from Iceland , the Italian government seems to be heading in the opposite direction.
A Media and Wiretapping Bill that was under consideration by the Italian parliament for two years (harshly criticized by the United Nations) would have introduced a "gag rule" by restricting journalists from publishing wiretapping records during investigations, possibly in the public interest.
Thanks to sustained protest by citizens and journalists, these restrictions were formally removed from the text of the bill on July 21.
Yet somehow the new version still includes a small clause aimed at directly restricting online free speech,the so-called "blog-killing" provision (par.
29 of art. 1).
As the group blog MAVAFFANCULP explains it:

South Korean bloggers grieve for a Vietnam bride who was killed by her Korean husband a week after she landed Korea.
Thach Thi Hoang Ngoc (age 20) was stabbed and beaten to death by her husband Jang Du Hyo (age 47) who had a mental illness.
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak passed his condolence to the victim's family via Korean ambassador in Vietnam.
Korean bloggers, while expressing their grievances to the murdered bride, urged the government and the police to clamp down the unwarranted marriage agencies who often lead marriages into tragedies by hiding the husband's mental history, characters and status.
A screen shot image of a portal site after entering a search word: Vietnam brides.
When you enter a search word 'Vietnam brides' in the Naver.com, Korea's most widely used portal site, almost nine out of ten are the marriage broker sites, alluring young Korean guys that they can get a Vietnam or other foreign bride in a reasonable price.
The murdered young bride, Ngoc was the one on the market.
She arrived in Korea on July 1, got married and found as a cold body on 8.
She could not speak Korean and knew nothing about her husband and about his mental instability.
The husband later told the local police that he was instructed by a ghost to kill his wife.
Many Koreans were appalled by the news, most of them calling the incident as a national shame.
A lawyer blogger Springlaw commented in a posting that starts with a sentence ‘I am posting it, hoping such incident never happens again’ that the marriage was wrong from the start and it got ‘festered’ by the miscommunication, ignorance and late response.
Which country is the odd one out?
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Malaysia.
Okay, let's say I am an obnoxious author who wants to insult your general country knowledge and you try to impress me with what you know.
So Malaysia is economically more prosperous in South East Asia region, has better developed infrastructure, with substantially lower poverty rate, hmm... you may even say more democratic.
But odd one out indeed, Malaysia is also languished way below Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia in press freedom ranking.
As recent development of press freedom in Malaysia unfolds, there are 3 key outcomes that can be observed:
1) Opposition parties will continue to fight the hardest through online media, after being granted limited access to print and electronic media
2) Despite claims or evidence of supporting free media, government continues to hold the leverage in controlling media with information and printing acts. 3) Information censorship is ineffective as long as Internet remains uncensored.
Rising number of Internet users and independent online contents will shape major opinions and put government under pressure.
When latest press freedom index was released earlier this year, opposition politicians were quick to react through their own online party information portals and personal blogs.
Their online criticism intensified when government delayed decision in renewing opposition newsletters, and the banning of satirical political cartoons offered another opportunistic moment to fuel discontent and speculation through online media.
A citizen, Lai responded:
The reason that government gave, believe it or not, was that 'the contents can influence the people to revolt against the leaders and government policies'... Cartoons can cause the people to revolt?
Newly found weapon eh?
Interestingly, apart from online media strategy to criticize censorship, one opposition-led state actually took the unprecedented move to table the Freedom of Information bill to disclose information of public interests to every individual.
Anil said while chiding a state government representative who rejected the bill:
Today is something of a historic day for the country in our quest for a more accountable society...
As independent news portals and citizen media contents proliferate in the country, Gopal Krishnan predicted:
Despite these heavy-handed responses to alternative voices, the government must surely appreciate the futility (not to mention the political consequences) of continuing to restrict the space for independent journalism and commentary to exist.
As of 2009, it is estimated that over 65 percent of Malaysian homes were connected to the Internet.
Beyond this, not only have we witnessed the mushrooming of various online news outlets and sources competing for our screen time, there has also been an explosion of online citizen journalism and social media, which has – among other things - truly created a new political reality in the country.
Well ultimately, press freedom is not something that the government or opposition parties whimsically decide, but it is about citizens who demand the truth and reporters who want to report the truth.
Like Attan said:
Like I said, no matter what, we journalists lose - Najib's government suspends newspapers, Guan Eng (DAP party leader) bans them, and Anwar sues us.

When Salma first started keeping a blog in 2008, she was just 6 years old, probably the youngest Moroccan blogger.
She greeted the world back then with these words:
The use of national media as an instrument of propaganda has been fairly well documented in Tunisia.
Tunisian citizen media have been well adept at tracking the numerous instances of fabrication of information and censorship of publications critical of the government.
The latest evidence of media manipulation was identified by Tunisian bloggers on August 20 when newspaper Le Temps and its Arabic version Assabah published reports on fundation Zeitouna sending of humanitarian food supply to the victims of the floods in Pakistan.
To illustrate the report and the involvement of businessman and the president son-in-law Sakhr El Matri in the initiative, Le Temps published a photo showing Sakhr El Matri inspecting the materials before they were loaded into the aircraft:

The community blog Nawaat describes features on the images that suggest that they have been doctored:
In a space of a month, Singapore authorities caused a major uproar when they banned a film of an ex-political prisoner and arrested a British author who wrote a book about the death penalty in Singapore.
Picture taken from The Online Citizen
On 12 July 2010, the Media Development Authority announced its decision to ban a film (starting from 14 July 2010) depicting Dr Lim Hock Siew speaking publicly on his experience being detained under the Internal Security Act.
The film was filmed by Director Martyn See.
Mr See was also asked to remove the film from YouTube.
You can read the transcripts of the film here.
Singaporean blogger, Lucky Tan called for the truth to be told:
Basically what MICA is saying is they banned this film because they want only the truth to be told and this film is full of falsehoods, lies and distortions.
Dr Lim Hock Siew was detained for 20 years without trial.
During that period, the PAP govt had all the time to show the evidence and tell the truth so that we can all see how wonderful a job the ISD has done to protect us from evil.
We are all still waiting.
Picture taken from Jacob Geroge
On 18th July, British author Alan Shadrake was arrested by Singapore police in his hotel on charges of 'criminal defamation', a day after his book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which was critical of the Singapore judicial system was launched.
His book was also taken off major bookstores in Singapore.
He was detained for two days in which Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders called for his release.
Singapore socio-political blog, The Online Citizen wondered why Mr Shadrake was charged with criminal defamation:
Alan Shadrake’s book “Once a Jolly Hangman” makes for uncomfortable reading.
The book might have made those in power uncomfortable enough to arrest Mr Shadrake on the rarely used draconian charge of criminal defamation.
A Singaporean blog, Chemical Generation Singapore, wrote:
With the arrest of Shadrake, the whole issue is less about the death penalty, and more about where we draw the line on supposed foreign intervention.
Cracking down on local politicians getting foreign money and logistics is fine with me.
But turning the screws on a foreigner in his book launch, although the foreigner is like a taunting Oliver Fricker and asking for it, is a bit too much in my book.
Unless there is more than meets the eye here
Political Activist, Chee Siok Chin accused the Government of having 'dirty secrets':
Now, which authoritarian regime would want to have it’s “dirty little secrets” blown opened in a book?
The same goes for Dr. Lim Hock Siew’s speech that was put up by Martyn See on Youtube.
Of course Martyn had to comply with the MDA who required him to take it down.
After all, Dr. Lim spoke about his unlawful 19-year detention without trial by the ISD.
Again, which oppressive regime would want to have the truth told about how it entrenches its power blown open in a video clip that can be accessed by all?
A bee pollinates a flower in Baguio, Philippines - copyright Jay Suasin on Flickr (used with permission)This school year, the Philippine government is implementing a United Nations-backed sex education program in public schools for children and teenagers.
The sex education program is being piloted in selected schools around the country and will include topics such as reproductive health, HIV/AIDS prevention, and family planning.
The Catholic Church has expressed strong opposition to the program.
Bloggers comment on the issue.
Tom Martin asks if sex education should be done "in the classroom or behind a tree?"
No parent is going to have absolute control over the places their children are going to learn about sex and it seems to me that a wise parent would at least want his or her children to be exposed to proper sex education by trained teachers in a controlled school setting rather than learning about sex from a peer behind a tree.
The Pinoy Catholic echoes the official stand of the local clergy and adamantly suggests that sex education should be left to the parents.
A Filipina Mom Blogger points out that not all parents may know how to discuss sex with their children:
"We can’t assume parents know how to discuss sex openly.
Some might be uneducated to understand the anatomy of reproduction and thus fail to grasp natural birth control methods."
The Catacomb recommends that sex education should be given to the parents instead. Why not leave these children alone for now..
Or maybe government should try to impose a law of proper parenting, where in parents are given some constant trainings or symposiums that will equip them with proper knowledge in giving their children the right guidance as they grow up.
This will prevent not only the exposure of children to the sensitivity of sex but it will also give the parents a better chance to bond with their kids, spending quality time, giving the necessary attention, love and care...
The x-piles believes that those against the sex education program should go after the mass media instead.
The church could have overlooked the real culprit for the alleged generation of sexual perverts – the mass media.
Violence and sex are prevalent on many T.V. shows and movies and these are all absorbed by the youth and children as well.
All of these have the capacity to change the moral perception of the youth’s developing minds, bringing them to confusion on what is right or wrong.
Meanwhile, Quod Dixit Dixit questions the government's motives for implementing the program.
It is not clear to me whether the government’s move sprung from its idea that overpopulation is one of the root causes of grinding poverty in the Philippines and hence, it must be put into a lower gear. (N.B.: I always assume perhaps with precision that the main roots of poverty in the country are graft and corruption and the unabated abuse and destruction of the environment and natural resources.)
The women's group Gabriela see the program as a step in the right direction.
The Department of Education (DepEd)’s Memorandum No. 26, allowing the use of teaching modules on sex education, could be a positive step, granting that DepEd will conduct an intensive process of consultation with different stakeholders before full implementation.
This will ensure that the program is not implemented mechanically, and all arguments are heard.
In our part, GABRIELA, Gabriela Women’s Party and SALINLAHI are willing to become part of the consultation process and share our extensive experience in gender and sexuality education with children and parents.
Ducky Paredes, however, believes that the program is as good as dead with the appointment of Brother Armin Luistro FSC to the post of Secretary of Education by the new Aquino administration.
Is this the end of the UN-funded program for sex education for lour public schools?
Probably.
One cannot see how a Christian brother can support sex education for elementary and high school students considering that many in the Catholic Church believe that exposing students to learning about sex and sexuality will surely lead to unwanted pregnancies.
That African Girl is a blog with a series of posts written by Africans around the world about their childhood.
It is a blog about growing up in an African family and learning to live in two worlds.
The bloggers sharing their memories have lived both in Africa and the West.
The blog was started by Makafui Fiavi and Adey Teshome.
Makafui was born in Togo and grew up in the United States and Adey is young Ethiopian-American.
This is Makafui's introduction:
During the college years, many people take the time to better understand themselves and their place in the world.
Most people do it by trying out different identities, or exploring different social circles and ideologies.
For me, the 4 years brought an exploration of my various sub-identities and a strong desire to learn how to live between 2 worlds.
Born and raised in Togo and growing up in the United States has given me the desire to explore and understand various cultures, to listen to stories and to learn about what brings people together.
That African Girl (TAG) is the culmination of ideas, conversations and a desire to continue learning and sharing.
Here’s where I share about things, people, places, stories, dreams and passions that inspire me.
Adey Teshome considers the blog as "a place for the cultural hybrid, multi-interest, eclectic children such as ourselves to air our thoughts":
When I first agreed to contribute to this blog, I was super-inspired by Mak’s idea–a place for the cultural hybrid, multi-interest, eclectic children such as ourselves to air our thoughts.
And as I like to say, this is why we’re friends.
She has such an eye for self-expression and such cool views to share.
And I loved the thought of being part of that.
So that’s who I’ll try to be for this blog– a young Ethiopian-American, recent (well, in the works) college grad, trying to figure out my place and get my grounding in life, who can put in her two cents every now and then.
Liz A. is a contributor from Uganda/Kenya living in the United States. These are her childhood memories:
1) Being beaten as punishment.
I always found it interesting when my White or Asian friends would talk about being told to sit in a corner, or were sent to their room as a form of punishment.
For us, we were beaten.
My mum would usually get very thin branches that had fallen off the trees in our compound and my dad would get the thick ones, sometimes we would be sent to get them ourselves, and we would be given a few lashes on the calves of our legs.
In America, it seems that such a thing can result in social services being called in to review the situation or children here feel some sort of resentment towards their parents for it.
But I have
School children being told to chant candidates’ names by their teachers.
Civil servants getting sacked for not campaigning for their political bosses.
Zinc roofing being traded for votes.
The public wholesaling of voters’ personal data to campaigners.
Death threats to those who denounce electoral crimes.
Welcome to the unpleasant side of Brazilian electioneering.
These are just some of the reports coming from Eleitor 2010, a "crowdsourcing" project aiming to facilitate citizen reports of abuses of the electoral process in Brazil.
In the largest democracy in Latin America - with over 120 million voters - this year, voters go to the polls they will be choosing the successor of one of the country's most popular Presidents in history (Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva) but also voting on governors, a large portion of Congress.

Every country has its own unique political culture and oddities.
Even the most minimal democracy has its own rules around electioneering, the mechanics of the vote, and ensuring that the state regulates the electoral process.
Brazil was one of the first democracies of its size to use electronic voting machines.
It also has compulsory voting.
But other aspects of its electoral process are unique, including attempts to strictly regulate of online campaigning, vote buying and what are called "showmícios" (concert-rallies).
Brazil has very clear and comprehensive laws regulating elections but the problem is enforcing these laws.
There is a real culture of politicians subverting the law, maintaining a privileged position as patrons of voters in Brazil.
This stems from a distant colonial past and continued persistent inequality, where entrenched elite interests have maintained themselves.
The idea behind Eleitor 2010, which is a purely volunteer, non-partisan project run by a virtual team with zero funding, is to engage the voter beyond the day of the election.
According to Paula Góes and Diego Casaes, its creators - who met via Twitter and now collaborate on Global Voices Online, the project is to promote critical and active citizenship, that challenges some of the arcane and undemocratic practices mentioned above.
Eleitor 2010 runs on the open source software Ushahidi, a web-based platform which received much attention for its utility in mapping incidents after the Haiti earthquake, driven by SMS reports from the ground.
Ushahidi has yet to reach its full potential as an election monitoring platform, say Góes and Casaes.
With an estimated 25% of the country online every day, and one of the highest mobile subscriber rates in Latin America, they hope Brazil could be the place where it comes of age this year.
Four weeks away from the election, Eleitor 2010 already has 230+ reports, from every state in the country, and from the most remote areas.
However, it is an uphill battle to get the message out about the platform, in a country where broadcast and print media are still strong, held in the hands of a privileged elite bent on defending its interests.
Despite this, the communications team at Eleitor 2010 has generated some media attention, and networking with other online transparency initiatives has been crucial.
Google recently featured Eleitor 2010 on its page dedicated to the Brazilian elections.
Góes and Casaes hope that with their awareness campaign - on social networks including Orkut with over 40 million users, partnerships with networks of internet cafés, NGOs, and social movements - Eleitor 2010 will break through and change the way thousands of voters engage in the electoral process.
Through the plaftorm, some entertaining anecdotes have already come to light, well in advance of the October 3 vote.
Voters caught one man in a small town in the interior selling off Twitter accounts with 40,000+ followers for the sickeningly low price of US$125. This is illegal under Brazilian electoral law.
When confronted, the man in question gave more incriminating evidence and then threatened to sue Eleitor 2010.
The evidence, including screenshots and transcript of a chat with him, were delivered to the Electoral Courts.
Another comic report from São Paulo, where teachers at a school illegally encouraged children to chant for two candidates, one for mayor and one for President, and it backfired with children instinctively chanting "Lula!"
"Lula!"
The video circulated widely, and has had over 70,000 views.
Another video that raised eyebrows was one by blogger Ricardo Gama of a VW bus owned by the City Hall being used for a campaign in Rio de Janeiro.
The blogger shouts “Are you carrying electoral propaganda in the car of the City Hall?
This is an electoral crime!
I filmed it.
I am going to denounce you.”
From the north of Brazil, in the state of Maranhão, word reached Eleitor 2010 that a network of evangelical churches was offering to “trade” 3,000 votes for “support” after the election.
In the state of São Paulo, one Bishop implored the faithful not to support President Lula’s chosen successor, Dilma Roussef.
These examples indicate how this platform and online, participatory tools will be of use in years to come. No matter whether it goes “viral” and becomes a household name, Eleitor 2010 and other transparency initiatives have already become game-changers this election year.
Early on Thursday September 23, Colombians woke up with the news: the day before, 30 airplanes and 27 helicopters of the Colombian Air Force raided a camp where Víctor Julio Suárez, better known as Jorge Briceño or Mono Jojoy, one of the top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), was hiding with dozens of guerrillas near La Macarena, Meta.
Suárez, 57, was killed in the so-called "Operation Sodom", as president Juan Manuel Santos confirmed from New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly.
Five members of the State security forces were injured and a female police dog was killed .
Other top guerrilla members might have been caught in the 300 square-meter camp —which reportedly included an underground bunker— and the Colombian Armed Forces (mostly members of the Colombian Army and the Colombian National Police which landed after the combats ended) are identifying them as this post is being written.
On Thursday afternoon unofficial sources claimed that FARC leader Henry Castellanos, Romaña, had also been killed in the operation
Mono Jojoy, who was tipped off by an informant, was considered the leader of the hard-line military wing of the FARC and was the commander of its Eastern Bloc.
Regarded as "one of the most blood-thirsty" guerrillas , he had 62 arrest warrants against him, had been sentenced 5 times, and the United States had asked for his extradition for drug-trafficking related charges, offering a reward for his capture.
A controversy arose when El Tiempo, the daily newspaper with the highest circulation in the country (and partially owned by President Juan Manuel Santos' family), posted a series of tweets regarding the news:
@eltiempocom
Rajesh Jain at Emergic criticizes the ban on all bulk SMS and MMS in India to prevent mass mobilization of people before and after the Ayodhya verdict.
A reliable source has told Global Voices that Tehran's prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for jailed Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan (also known as "Hoder").
The presiding judge, named Salavati, has not yet ruled in the case.
Derakhshan has been accused of “collaborating with enemy states, creating propaganda against the Islamic regime, insulting religious sanctity, and creating propaganda for anti-revolutionary groups.”
He was arrested 22 months ago, and his trial began in June 2010.
The reasons for Hoder’s initial arrest upon his return to Iran from Canada in 2008 remain unclear, but many speculated that his two (highly publicised) trips to Israel were the primary reason.
Derakhshan holds a Canadian passport, but Iran does not recognize dual citizenship and visiting Israel is frowned upon by the government.
Confusing in this case, is that Hoder gained worldwide notoriety as a leading Iranian blogger and free speech activist (even blogging for Global Voices in 2004 and 2005).
Later he changed tacks and wrote favorably of President Mahmoud Ahmedinajhad's policies regarding the United States, nuclear weapons, Israel, and even intolerance for public dissent from human rights activists.
In April of 2009, Iranian president, President Ahmadinejad, issued a letter calling for Hossein Derakhshan’s case to be processed in a timely and legal fashion.
The Canadian government has not been publicly vocal on Derakhshan's case.
A Free Hoder blog was created by online free speech activists shortly after his arrest in 2008.
On Twitter, Sanam Dolatshahi tweeted the news of a possible death penalty, and a site in Persian called Kamtarin has also mentioned it, noting that despite previous rumors that Derakhshan was being held for "spying" in Israel this is apparently not one of the accusations for which the prosecutor seeks his death.
In a blog created by Derakhshan's family, Edalat Baraye Hossein Derakhshan (meaning justice for Hossein Derakhshan) there are still no reports or updates on this topic.
The last post on the family blog is dated August 15, and says that Hossein's trial ended weeks ago :
We are waiting for the verdict.
He had not got even one week vacation out of prison to come home...
It is the second Ramadan that he is not at home...
He told us the quality of food since last Ramadan became better in prison...
His mother is very worried...
It is said this month God answers the prayers easier...
Please do not forget our Hossein.
Iranian Blogger Z8tun summed up the situation about two years ago:
“Other Iranians have been caught visiting Israel, but were released after a few hours of interrogation.
Some speculate that Derakhshan, who in recent years became a supporter of President Ahmadinejad’s government, was arrested because he insulted some religious leaders in the country.
He has himself argued in Western media, despite multiple testimonies of jailed bloggers, that nobody goes to jail in Iran because of the content of their blog.”
The Islamic Republic has cracked down on the blogosphere in recent years, and there are several other bloggers sentenced to prison in Iran including human rights activist Shiva Nazar Ahari.
On 18 March 2009, Omid Reza Mir Sayafi became the first blogger to die in suspicious circumstances in an Iranian prison.
YardFlex.com is following the Buju Banton drug possession case which goes to trial in the U.S. on Monday.
In light of news that two co-defendants have turned state witnesses, the blog says: "The next couple of days will be crucial as Buju and his lawyers hunker down and prepare to tell previously untold stories."
Caribbean bloggers are mourning the loss of one of the region's soca music pioneers - Alphonsus Cassell, better known as "Arrow" - whose mega-hit, Hot, Hot, Hot is largely credited with taking soca to a global audience.
News reports confirm that the singer had been ailing from cancer for some time; bloggers' tributes have been both touching and personal.
One Tribe, Many Voices recognises that his music was a soundtrack to the lives of many Caribbean people, even posting a link for readers to take a listen:
For many people who are not familiar with Calypso, Arrow may not be a recognizable name but for those of us who have danced and partied from Brooklyn to Port of Spain that is not the case.
Arrow brought a distinct flavor to Kaiso, it was the flavor of Montserrat.
Arrow put Montserrat and himself on the musical map in 1982 with his gigantic hit: 'Hot, Hot, Hot'.
I can recall being drenched in sweat in Trinidad Carnival as Arrow sang 'Bills', 'Soca Rhumba' and 'Rub Up'.
His was a different take on soca, it had the feel of merengue and it seemed to crossover into a more Pan-Caribbean vibe.
The beat was hard and it reminded me of the French Caribbean and the Spanish Caribbean all at once.
The horns were very prominent, in your face.
The Caribbean Camera lists Arrow's musical achievements, but also offers a peek into another side of the man:
The title track became his first pan-Caribbean hit and the biggest selling soca hit of all time.
Arrow also established himself as a businessman in Montserrat, owning the Arrow`s Manshop store in Plymouth.
When it was destroyed by the Soufriere Hills volcanic eruption, he relocated to Salem.
He organized a fundraising calypso festival on the island in 1996, in response to the devastation caused by the volcano.
Arrow continued to be much in demand in the Caribbean and most recently performed at the Cricket World Cup 2007 opening ceremonies with Shaggy, Byron Lee and Kevin Lyttle.
Finally, from St. Vincent and the grenadines, Abeni says:
Born on the tiny island of Montserrat Alphonsus 'Arrow' Cassell's talent was anything but tiny.
He gave us hits such as 'Pirates', 'Long Time' and the monster hit 'Hot, Hot, Hot'.
It was to enjoy more success following Buster Poindexter's remake in 1987.
Years later, St Vincent's Kevin Lyttle was to enjoy unprecedented success with his hit 'Turn me on'. So, it is I think fair to say that Arrow paved the way for other soca artistes to realize that soca could be marketed to non traditional markets.
I think it was on the weekend I read that he was airlifted to Antigua for medical attention.
Today (September 15th) I learnt he had succumbed to brain cancer.
My condolences go out to his family and the people of Montserrat who are mourning his loss.
If it's any consolation he will always be 'hot, hot, hot'.

Yesterday rumors spread in Mozambique about a general strike via word of mouth, SMS, and even Twitter.
The motive: the "unjust" cost of living - rises in the price of bread, water and electricity.
Readers may recall that an increase the price of minibuses sparked riots and protest in February 2008.
So the city went to sleep on edge.
While the mainstream media is just starting to report this, this morning bloggers and twitters have already been reporting on events.
Eduardo Castro of Elefante News writes
Rioting in township areas.
Rubber bullets fired.
Burning tyres on the roads, and a smoke haze rising up over Maputo from the fires.
Update - 12:15 pm Maputo time:
A citizen media Ushahidi platform has been launched by Jornal A Verdade (@verdademz).
As of now, there are over 50 incidents among which reports of deaths, including of two children shot at Av. Acordos de Lusaka.
Update - 18:44 pm Maputo time:
A Verdade released a statement from the Government of Mozambique, appealing to citizens for calm, as the night fell.

Rakesh Katal recounts the joys and challenges of working with communities in rural Zambia.
Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has just concluded a two-day visit to Lebanon.
It was his first official since 2005 when he first took office.
He held talks with Lebanese officials and visited strongholds of Iran's ally Hezbollah in the capital's southern suburbs and south Lebanon, and received a hero's welcome.
Several Iranian bloggers reacted to this trip.
Meybodema has published several photos of Ahmadinejad's visit in Lebanon and quoted Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who praised the Islamic Republic and welcomed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The blogger quotes Nasrallah saying that contrary to all propaganda, "Iran is helping the oppressed".
Sayeh Azadi has republished (see above) a cartoon by leading Iranian cartoonist Nikahang from in Roozonline with the headline "Ahmadinejad's dreams for Lebanon".
Z8unak counts some reasons of why Lebanese people welcomed Ahmadinejad.
The blogger writes :
Why you were surprised that Ahmadinejad was greeted so warmly in Lebanon?
After 20 years of the Iran-Iraq war, border cities did not get constructed but houses in Lebanon were constructed by our money.
Many Iranians can not afford going to a doctor or hospitals and die every day as a result, meanwhile Iran constructs hospitals in Lebanon.
Mollah writes with irony:
Lebanese did not see any bad things from the Iranian government.
If we were Lebanese and got the money we would become Islamic Republic's supporters... They say, we don't care that they are in power after a 'coup' or that they torture people... just pass the dollars.
Whilst this story raises legitimate concerns over the violation of human rights by the Polisario Front and the Algerian regime, some bloggers expressed outrage over the indifference of local mainstream media and the Moroccan government over the fate of a young Moroccan, Fodeil Aberkane.
It is a more local, but way more horrifying story of a young man, whose most basic human right, the right to life, has been denied.
The victim was 37 years old and his brutal death in a police station in the old city of Salé, near the capital Rabat, is for many bloggers, reminiscent of the Years of Lead, the dark era of the previous regime of King Hassan II, when police brutality and torture perpetrated by state agents was a horrifying reality Moroccans had to live with.
Fodeil is arrested on September 11th, 2010, and charged with consuming cannabis.
After 48 hours spent in jail a judge decides to release him.
A few days later Fodeil goes back to the police station, to ask for the return of his belongings: a motorcycle and a cellphone.
An altercation follows and Fodeil ends up again in prison, accused of "insulting officers during the exercise of their function."
Two days after that he is transferred to the main hospital in Rabat where he is pronounced dead.
There is no doubt in the minds of Fodeil's family and friends as to what led to this tragic end : police brutality and torture.
An investigation is launched but no charges brought as of yet against any of the persons believed to be involved in the death of Fodeil Aberkane.
The story has grabbed the attention of bloggers and online activists as it comes amidst a climate of decline in freedom of the press in the country and, since, as writer and blogger Laila Lalami reminds us, it isn't an isolated incident:
Fodail Aberkane is not an exception.
Over the last few years, allegations of torture have been made against the police in Morocco on many occasions.
Two years ago, Zahra Boudkour, a 21-year-old university student from Marrakech, was arrested for taking part in a student demonstration.
She was stripped naked and beaten, but no one was brought to account for the violence that was visited upon her.
In his encounter with the Marrakech police, another university student, Abdelkebir El Bahi, found himself thrown from the 3rd floor window of a dorm.
He is now in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
Boudkour and El Bahi were abused and tortured because of their ideas and their ideals.
Fodail Aberkane was trying to get his moped back.
Bill Day writing on the a la menthe agrees:
Because the victims are not celebrities, they suffer and die unnoticed by the Western media — out of sight, out of mind.
While the Kingdom has broken very publicly with the "Years of Lead," during which there was widespread torture of political dissidents under King Hassan II, incidents such as those reported by Lalami are a chilling counterpoint to the current regime's bright face of prosperity, particularly when coupled with ongoing suppression of any kind of free press.
Blogger and activist Najib Chaouki created a Facebook group called "We Are All Victims of Torture," in which preamble he calls for the "perpetrators of this crime to be prosecuted diligently."
Blogger Larbi denounces the double standards of the Moroccan government .
He writes:
Tanzanians will go to the polls on 31 October 2010 to elect the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, President of Zanzibar, Members of Parliament and Members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives.
This is a roundup of blog posts about the elections.
Tom Rhodes reports that the Tanzanian government has threatened the press ahead of the elections:
Whether the Tanzanian press feel at liberty to cover this tight race is another matter.
Critical reporting on the government during this sensitive time appeared risky after Ministry of Information Permanent Secretary Sethi Kamuhanda toured print media offices earlier this month, threatening to shutter any media house that "put the government in a bad light," state television reported.
More than 50 human rights and media organizations issued a joint statement last week, claiming the government has threatened the press in advance of the forthcoming elections.
Since polling began, the Registrar of Newspapers, a government-run licensing agency, has been busy issuing letters to newspapers, warning against any negative coverage of the government, local journalists told CPJ.
Three private weeklies, Mwanahalisi, Raia Mwena, and Tanzania Daima have all been warned by the Registrar to avoid coverage deemed "inciteful" by the government or face suspension.
"Such kinds of threats have been common from the Registrar of Newspapers, whom the minister uses as a means to enforce self-censorship," the chairman of the Tanzania Editors' Forum, Absalom Kibanda, told me.
The country's leading Kiswahili daily, Mwananchi, received two letters from the Registrar recently threatening to suspend the paper for negative government coverage, Managing Editor Theophil Makunga told me.
ZanziBits says that the absence of violence in 2010 election campaigns in Zanzibar shows that people have embraced democracy:
In past election years, there was political violence in Zanzibar as people prepared for the elections, but not this time.
All of the campaigning has been peaceful and secure.
These are good signs for our country, because it shows that our people are embracing democracy and becoming involved in the political process.
Campaigning officially ends on October 30.
On October 31, the Tanzanian people will choose their new leader.
We all hope that it is someone who is fairly elected and who will bring development to our country.
Above all, we all hope that our elections are as peaceful as the campaigns have been.
God bless Tanzania and its islands.
Labda Hata Mimi writes about Tanzania election and the growing tech community:
There is now an Ushahidi Election Violence, Issue and Rioting Reporting Map instance up for the Tanzanian elections taking place next Sunday.
You can also apply as an ushahidi voluntia translator and verifier at this Google Form.
As of last week, one of four polls suggests opposition may have an edge.
I do not take a position for any party in the elections but I do hope that they are carried out peacefully.
I especially hope that my friends in country, Watanzania and Wamerikani alike, are safe.
Pernille announces the launch of Uchaguzi Tanzania:
UCHAGUZI, TZ is a platform that leverages on USHAHIDI's web and mobile-based technology software, enabling unprecedented collaboration between election observers and citizens to monitor elections in near-real time.
Check it out now - the Tanzania elections are on Sunday, and it will be interesting to see how the crow-sourching tool will boost information in this regard.
Kenyan blogger, Chris, asks, "Will there be trouble in Tanzania after election?":
On Sunday Kenya’s next door neighbours, Tanzania go to the polls.
The reality on the ground is that the Tanzanians have been watching with great interest and then envy as Kenya has gone through a very eventful two years or so.
Tanzanians are now asking why ordinary folks in their country cannot be like Kenyans who to them appear to be very much aware of their rights and willing to fight for them.
I was shocked beyond words recently when I overheard ordinary Tanzanians in a Dar-es-salaam surburb discussing Sunday’s polls and saying that it would be a good idea to stock up in food and stay indoors, expecting the worst.
He continues:
To most Kenyans (like the guys who never miss an opportunity to spew tribal hatred in this blog) it would be mighty difficult to understand Tanzanian politics.
Tribalism hardly exists in this country that is almost the size of both Kenya and Uganda put together and boasts of over 140 tribes (to Kenya’s 40 something).
Neither is there a history of certain tribes reigning supreme over others.
The one man who must take the most credit for this unity that is rare to find in any African country is the founding father the late Mwalimu Julius Kabarage Nyerere.
While Kenya’s Tom Mboya and Jomo Kenyatta prided themselves in national symbols based on strong animals like the lion, Nyerere quietly chose the unassuming Giraffe.
And there is plenty of proof in the man’s life that he was able to see extremely far into the horizon so much so that he still holds great sway even from the grave.
Nyerere unified the country by aggressively adopting the Swahili language into the fabric and way of life of Tanzanians.
Jerry Okungu advises Tanzanians not to fall into Kenya's trap of election violence:
Three different newspapers published in Dar es Salaam cannot be wrong especially if one of them, the oldest, belongs to the CCM.
They are all saying more-or-less the same thing; that there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.
They are all expressing fear that Bongoland’s elections may be rigged in favor of the ruling party based on the mood in the country that seems to be craving for regime change in the land of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.
Signs that all is not well are clearly brought out in the latest opinion results conducted by Research and Education in Democracy in Tanzania(REDET), a state owned research center housed at the University of Dar es Salaam, Synovate of Kenya and several online surveys conducted by Daily News, Uhuru Publications and ThisDay newspaper published by Reginald Mengi’s outfit.
In the run-up to the Kenyan elections in 2007, we had a similar scenario where opinion polls became the centre of vicious debates, claims and counter claims of doctored results depending on who or which party was favored or dismissed by the polls.
Whenever an opinion poll favored PNU, other parties and their supporters dismissed it as cooked.
On the other hand, if another pollster published results that favored ODM, other players routinely dismissed it as bogus.
VijanaFM blog lists technology initiatives that revolve around people-to-people reporting on election issues:
A few weeks ago we told you we started TZelect, an Ushahidi-based platform that aims to collect and discuss reports from East African youth about election events.
Recently we were contacted by a few organizations who have put together a similar platform, Uchaguzi Tanzania, which allows for reports to be sent in via SMS.
Both TZelect and Uchaguzi Tanzania are focussed on the immediete elections being held in Tanzania on October 31st of this year, as well as the long-term progress of elected candidates in office.
However, while Uchaguzi Tanzania is built to accomodate hour-to-hour updates from the general public on the ground in Tanzania, TZelect is built to collect continuous, analytical discussions about these election events, specifically from youth.
An American in Tanzania writes about her experience at a political rally for the main opposition party, Chadema:
On Thursday afternoon I attended a Chadema (Chama Cha Demokracia na Maendeleo, or Party of Democracy and Development) political rally for Doctor Slaa, the most popular opposition presidential candidate on the mainland.
Despite the fact that he never showed up (TIA, right?) and that I only understood about 40% of what various candidates yelled crazy-African-preacher-style over the loudspeaker, it was a really interesting and enlightening experience.
I made friends with two high school teachers and we discussed (in Swahili!) the election, the history of Tanzania, and the platforms and promises of various parties and candidates.
Tanzania will go to the polls on October 30, 2010 and the general election campaign is well underway.
As the campaigns heat up, presidential candidates and other candidates fighting for parliamentary seats are using new media tools to communicate with potential voters.
Along with campaign rallies, which target the majority of the population, a small number of politicians have started to use social media tools such as blogs, online videos, Facebook and twitter to create deeper engagement with voters.
It is hard to accurately comment on the impact of the ongoing online campaigns because of lack of up-to-date statistics on usage of social media tools in Tanzania.
The number of Tanzanians using the Internet is still small in comparison to the total population.
In a country of 41 million people there are only 676,000 Internet users representing 1.6% of the total population.
Among those with access to the internet there are only 141,580 Facebook users, with 74% of them aged between 18-34 years.
Whether created by fans or formal campaign officials, there are a few websites, blogs, facebook pages and twitter accounts running campaigns for presidential candidates and those fighting for parliamentary seats from the ruling CCM party.
The official website of the current president and the ruling CCM party candidate, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, has a link to a facebook page with more than 4,500 followers.
There is also another facebook page dedicated to Mr Kikwete with more than 13,500 fans.
Kikwete’s running mate who is also the candidate for the Vice President's post, Dr. Gharib Bilal, has more than one campaign websites.
One site is linked to Mr Kikwete’s website and Dr. Bilal’s twitter account, while the other website has a link to a facebook page dedicated to his campaign.
One of the opposition parties presidential candidates Dr. Wilbrod Slaa from CHADEMA party has a facebook page linked from his official website with about 910 fans.
Likewise there are more than two facebook pages dedicated to Dr. Slaa’s campaign with about 9000 people who ‘like’ Dr. Slaa.
He also has a twitter account with very few tweets.
Similar to Tanzania Mainland, election manifestos, pictures and videos of the campaign rallies are on display on the websites of the Zanzibar’s CCM presidential candidate Dr Ali Mohamed Shein as well as on his main opposition contender Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad from the Civic United Front (CUF).
The use social media platforms have made it possible for the campaign teams to interact directly with voters and to respond to their concerns.
These tools have also enabled Tanzanians leaving abroad to follow events happening back home.
When CCM refused to participate in elections debate, as explained here by blogger Shurufu Anasema, a twitter user Issa Mwamba challenged Kikwete:
Where Kikwete2010 replied:
I personally think CCM as an independent party has a right to select and choose the debate it can participate or not participate
Although there are doubts as to whether online campaigns will influence voters in a country with such low internet penetration, some bloggers such as Spotistarehe are hopeful:
On 31 October 2010, more than 19.6 million Tanzanians will make an important decision for the future of their country.
They will take part in the fourth general election since the introduction of multiparty democracy.
With only a few days left before the polls, Tanzanian blogosphere is following closely election campaigns conducted by various political parties.
One of the controversial issues in this year’s campaigns, it seems, is that most of university students will not be able to vote.
Senior Journalist Ndimara Tegambwage who blogs at Uhuru Hauna Kikomo writes about the issue:
...It is quite clear that Dr Wilbrod Slaa's decision to run as a presidential candidate has tilted the balance of power.
Now the debate is no longer about whether the ruling party's candidate will get a landslide victory - as in the previous election. rather, it is about how much that victory will be cut.
In Zanzibar, there are signs that there will be peaceful elections especially after the agreement to form a Government of National Unity in the Isles.
However, there are some nagging issues as described by Salma Said:
The meeting of Russia's top-bloggers with the Iranian Ambassador in Moscow three days after Hossein Derakhshan had been sentenced to 19.5 years of imprisonment for "anti-government propaganda" highlighted the clumsy attempts of the Iranian online diplomacy in Russia.
It also showed commercialization and excessive cynicism of some of the popular Russian bloggers.
On Sept. 30, 2010, LJ users tema, nl, sergeydolya and a few others visited the Iranian embassy to meet with "Iranian bloggers": Ambassador Seyed Mahmoud-Reza Sajjadi (aka LJ user sajjadi ) and Pavla Ripinskaya (aka pashili), author of the book "Incredible Iranians."
Sergey Dolya, a popular travel blogger and social media entrepreneur, posted this enthusiastic entry :
San Francisco-based physician and blogger Dr. Jan Gurley has visited Haiti twice since the January 12 earthquake to volunteer her services.
Her second visit coincided with the cholera outbreak that has claimed hundreds of lives and caused thousands more to be hospitalised since the first case appeared on October 19, 2010. "Cholera is a lethal infection of hurricane proportions," writes Doc Gurley (as she's known in the blogosphere):
You can die in as little as 3 hours, with your entire body’s amount of fluid coming out as stool.
Socially, in Haiti, I found in February that there was already tremendous stigma attached to diarrhea.
Not that surprising, really, if you think about the realities of living in a parking lot without a toilet while surrounded by hundreds of other people.
And now there are concerns that cholera may have been brought to Haiti by the very international workers who came to help. Besides the devastating toll on lives (with reports ranging from 200 to Russian reports of 500 dead from cholera), how much current, and potential, good-will could such an event destroy?
Doc Gurley looked around online for an instructional video on oral rehydration therapy (ORT) that she could leave with her Haitian colleagues and patients.
A knowledge of ORT basics could save lives, as most deaths from cholera are in fact caused by dehydration.
Doc Gurley reminds her readers that even in Haiti, video can be an effective tool for spreading information: "People there have cell phones and texts, and everyone has an email address.
Aid workers have smart phones that can show videos, and people there, just like here, love to gather ’round and watch the tiny screen."
When her online searches yielded nothing but a single Hausa-language video and a handful of others covertly advertising Gatorade-style electrolyte drinks, Doc Gurley got a few friends together and made the video below.
It's mostly wordless, making it suitable for use in any country, and depicts how to make oral rehydration salts "using only things that a person living in a sheet city would have", including PET water bottles and bottle caps:
4 caps sugar, 1 cap salt, 500ml clean water = life

This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. Her name is Marisol Valles García and she has been called the "bravest woman in Mexico" .
Valles García is a 20-year-old married woman studying her last year of Criminology; she is also the new chief of police in Práxedis, Chihuahua.
Práxedis is located around 100 kilometers (62 miles) away from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico's most violent city.
But, why was she given this important job?
Richard Grabman explained the situation in his blog The Mex Files:
The only candidate to step forward to command the public security force was Marisol Valles García, a twenty-year old criminology student.
The new sheriff in town (and the youngest police chief in Mexico) oversees a tiny department that at most can provide two shifts of patrol officers per community.
Cristhian García, a 21-year-old Mexican blogger, commented on the subject:
#HerooftheWeek Award goes to 20 yr old Marisol Valles Garcia, a criminology student that has become Police Chief in Guadalupe, Mexico...
Laura Ruíz (@YoSoyBereNice), from Veracruz, México contributed with her opinion:
20yr Marisol Valles Garcia is a real-life hero as police chief of Mexico's most violent town.
Let's show her support: http://bit.ly/ata0wm
Finally, in the blog Hermosillo at Periodista Digital , the case is addressed and Valles García is mentioned as someone her region is proud of:
She has been in prison for 15 years in the past 21 years, but now she is free at last.
Burmese pro-democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from detention by the military-backed government of Myanmar Saturday afternoon, a week after the holding of a nationwide election which was dominated by pro-administration candidates.
The Democratic Voice of Burma was able to document the first few minutes of her release.
This video shows Suu Kyi waving to supporters in front of her lakeside house.
AUNG SAN SUU KYI RELEASED from DVBTV English on Vimeo.
News spread out last Thursday that Suu Kyi will be freed this weekend on the date of expiration of her house arrest sentence.
It was reported that she has signed the paper for her release around 12pm on that day. Even members of the National League for Democracy (NLD), Suu Kyi's party, started cleaning the headquarter's secretariat office in anticipation of her release.
On Friday, there was a crowd of 500 or more people gathering in front of the NLD office in Yangon, all waiting for "Aunty Su's" release.
A banner in front of the headquarters reads "Today's the Day of Her Release".
More than 100 NLD members and supporters also donated blood at a local hospital to draw attention to her release.
Suu Kyi's impending freedom was later doubted when the Burmese top court rejected her final appeal against her house arrest this Friday, making the people anxious whether she will be released or not.
Meanwhile, Kim Aris, Aung San Su Kyi's son reportedly has gotten his visa approved to visit Myanmar.
Now that Suu Kyi is free at last, independent media site The Irrawaddy urges its readers to submit suggestions and other ideas to Suu Kyi
The world rejoiced when Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was freed from house arrest.
Twitter users used the hashtag #aungsansuukyi as they joined the global conversation in celebrating Suu Kyi's freedom.

Singer and composer José Carbajal, nicknamed "el Sabalero," was found dead in his house in Villa Argentina, Uruguay on October 21; he died of a heart attack at age 66.
José Carbajal is considered an icon of Uruguayan "canto popular" , as Martin Charquero (@MartinCharquero) explains via Twitter.
Throughout the day, Uruguayans have been reacting to the news of his death on social networks; and, as Mariu (@mariu070) said on Twitter,
Recently, it has been reported that an arranged marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 23-year-old teacher ‘has triggered a call for a fresh debate on child marriage’.
Under Malaysia’s Syariah Law, which has jurisdiction over Muslims, Muslims under the age of 16 would require the consent of the Syariah Court before a marriage is allowed.
In this case, the Court had granted permission for the couple to marry.
Glenda Larke believes that a child marriage is no different to paedophilia, even if it is legal.
A 14-year-old school girl is not an adult.
She's not a woman, even if she has started her menses.
She's still a child.
She looks up to adults.
Her religion and her culture tell her to obey her elders, especially her parents.
She is gullible and vulnerable.
A 23 year old man who marries her - an educated man, not some illiterate fellow whose society is still steeped in the 19th century idea that children should be working at 12 and married at 14 - is purely and simply a paedophile.
B.Joe is of the opinion that the rights of children and minors are not being upheld by the Syariah Court and the girl’s parents.
And the funny part of the whole deal is that the marriage was approved by the Syariah Court – what happened to the protection of the minor?
Why the parents could not wait for a few more years until the minor is able to decisions for herself?
Un:dhimmi also believes that it is morally wrong.
Study after study shows that girls subjected to sexual activity at such early ages suffer not only damage to their still-developing reproductive systems, but also lasting psychological trauma.
However, Fyzal took a more neutral stance on the issue.
In the situation above the consent of Syariah Court has been obtained.
That means we should have confidence in our Syariah Judges - they must have taken into account all circumstances before granting consent.
Such consent, I believe, had been granted on the confidence of the judges that the man can take care of the girl and the girl could grow up well under the care of that man.
If the judge doubted it, such consent will not be granted.
Thus, I submit that in the issue of the marriage of Muslim girls under the age of 16, lets the Syariah Courts do their work.
They know when to grant the consent and when not to grant the consent.
But I am of the view that open discussion is still required between the Government and the Syariah experts to deal with this issue.
The two hour session was also streamed online, allowing bloggers to participate via webcam through microblogging site, Twitter.
A range of topics were covered, including political reform within Brazil, abortion, education, corruption, and the country's foreign policy.
Media reform was particularly high on the agenda, with Lula affirming,
Secret US Embassy Cables Unveiled
While mainstream media across the Arab world gave the secret US Embassy cables released yesterday the cold shoulder, bloggers and Twitter users from the Middle East found much needed material to chew on.
The much anticipated release, by whistle-blower website Wikileaks, is expected to make more than 250,000 leaked US Embassy cables public - the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain.
From joy to skepticism, and sarcasm to cynicism, netizens broke down the cables related to the Middle East and North Africa, sparking discussions, questioning motives and seeking answers.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, tensions are rising following revelations that Arab states have discussed strikes on Iran with the US, amid rising concerns of Iran's nuclear ambitions; Arab and Israeli politicians sleep in the same bed; and other anecdotes on friction between the brotherly neighbours, who make up the Arab world.
Egyptian Sandmonkey describes the leaks as "glorious":
Just when the egyptian government thought it was done with the
elections headache, Wikileaks comes along and ******. It
was beautiful Karma in action.
Thanks to Wikileaks I felt like a child
who was allowed to listen to grown-up conversations for the first time.
And if that wasn’t sweet enough, seeing every foreign policy assessment I
have ever made become validated this way?
Gratification, defined.
For
years I have been talking about the Sunni-Israeli alliance, and how the
For
years I have been waiting for that moment when the Arab street rhetoric
catches up with reality and for the political status quo to get
rearranged as it should’ve a long time ago.
There is now evidence that Egypt is aiding Israel in isolating Hamas, that Mubarak has nothing but utter hatred for the Muslim Brotherhood and utter distrust towards Qataris and Syrians, that the entirety of the arab gulf region, including Qatar, are weary of Iran’s lies and would love to see Iran gone or disarmed, and that they all would secretly support a strike on Iran from either the US or Israel.
The dichotomy between their rhetoric and actions was finally exposed as
hypocritical and duplicitous to their people and to the world.
Told you it was Glorious!
there are two countries who are bound to enjoy them: Iran and Israel.
Israel must be relishing that its public knowledge now that everyone in the region wants Iran dealt and is on their side, and that the Sunni-Israeli alliance is now proven to be both real and inclusive of
For the Israeli public that may be relieving, but for the Netenyahu Government, it’s empowering.
They are no longer the war-mongering dog howling in the wilderness anymore; even their longest feuding enemies agree with them.
give their government reasons to solidify their power against those mounting numbers of enemies all around it, both foreign or domestic. And
secretly, in their heart of hearts, they must be relishing it: they always wanted to be recognized as a big regional player, and those documents prove without a doubt that they truly are.
On the Egyptian Chronicles, Zeinobia received the leaks with surprise:
I expected to be indirectly as nobody said anything about Egypt In the last few days as we all thought the Wikileaks cables will include the GCC, Israel, Turkey and Iran.
At least this is what we understood from the news reports about how the States are scared on its relations with these countries excluding Iran.
She also anticipates trouble and asks:
Up till now I do not know how Julian Assange got these 1/4 million cables or why he publishes them considering the fact he has created a huge diplomatic crisis not between the U.S and other countries but also between countries themselves like for instance Egypt and Qatar as you will see.
Moving on to the situation in nearby Gaza, Zeinobia blogs:
Of course those Egyptian newspapers who dared to publish reports about the Wikileaks like Al Masry Al Youm only highlighted the part concerning Egypt’s refusal to assume control of Gaza after the victory of Israel that did not take place as a sign of Mubarak’s patriotism but let’s remember something that the officials in Egypt denied any prior knowledge to the “Operation Cast lead” in the early days of that operation turning in to war.
It is amazing how Israel was too confident from its victory on Hamas !!
In another post, Sandmonkey analyses the response of Arab media to the leak.
He writes:
I joked today on Twitter
that I believe the world will probably deal with this the same way regular people deal with post-one-night-stand-hook-up awkwardness: Everyone had their fun but seen each other naked and now they just wanna do their walk of shame and pretend it never happened.I have been monitoring media websites the entire day waiting to see how
seems that the media honchos decided that they couldn't ignore the news completely, so they went with option #2.
On Twitter, users have been busy breaking down the cables and commenting on their content in 140 character messages.
The onslaught of reactions on Twitter made users suggest a new hashtag to discuss the documents related to the Arab world.
Saudi Essam Al Zamel tweets: اقترح احد الاخوة استخدام الهاش تاج التالي للكتابة عن تسريبات الويكي ليكس الأخيرة #wikiarab
Someone suggested that we use the hashtag #wikiarab to tweet about the latest Wikileaks leak
From Bahrain, Foreign Affairs Minister Khalid Al Khalifa jokes:
Tweeters beware, cleanup your DM box or soon someone will break in and give your DMs to #Wikileaks #cablegate
In another tweet, he adds:
The American ambassador just sent me an email labeled "UNCLASSIFIED" .. #cablegate #Wikileaks
Egyptian Wael Ghonim quips:
Some secrets are best left unexposed! #cablegate
Ahmed Naguib, from Egypt, adds:
I am going to spend my winter break going through #wikileaks files.
Finally something interesting to read.
And Palestinian Ali Abunimah places another piece in the jigsaw:
#Cablegate only another piece in a pattern of evidence of full Abbas-Fayyad PA complicity in the Gaza massacre and its cover up.
Suad Alkhawaja, from Bahrain, concludes: تسريبات ويكيليس لم تأت بجديد للمواطن أو الحكومات العربية، جميعنا يعرف من على وفاق او خلاف مع من وماسيحدث هو تعميق للشرخ الموجود
Wikileaks latest exposure doesn't bring anything new to Arab governments and people.
We all know who is friendly and whose relations are strained and what will happen is that the existing fault will become wider.
And then adds: لذلك أعتقد ان هذه التسريبات ستؤثر أكثر على علاقات الحكومات مع بعضها البعض وسياساتها الخارجية أكثر مما ستؤثر على المواطن. #Wikileaks
This is why I think that these leaks will only impact the relations of governments with each other and their foreign policies, more than they will impact the people.

This post is part of our special coverage South Sudan Referendum 2011. Today's independence referendum in Sudan has put the country on the radar in the Arabic twitterosphere.
From Saudi Arabia to Palestine, Arab tweeps are discussing Sudan's unity, division and resources.
The referendum is part of the 2005 Naivasha Agreement between the Khartoum central government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement and may see the division of South Sudan from the rest of the country.
From Saudi Arabia, Omar Alattas asks: When will the Sudan referendum results be announced?
And then concludes: #sudan اليوم ستصبح الجزائر أكبر دولة عربية عوضا عن السودان بلد المليون ميل Today Algeria will replace Sudan as the largest Arab country
Bader Aujan, also from Saudi Arabia, is positive about the future:
#Sudan ألمانيا اتحدت بعد أنقسام وهونغ كونغ عادت للصين بعد أقتطاع وستعود السودان إن شاء الله وسيكون الأنفصال دافعاً قوياً للتنمية Germany reunited after its division; Hong Kong returned to China after its separation; and I hope too that Sudan will return.
I hope this separation will be a strong incentive for development.
Germany is a great example how separated countries one day would join back again peacefully. #Sudan is not an exception!
And Mohamed Osman, also tweeting from Saudi Arabia, appeals to his readers: Dear Arab brothers, Please stop crying and making an issue over Sudan.
There was a 26 year war in which you were quiet.
Please continue your silence now.
Palestinian Bahaa AlKayyali prays for a united Sudan: Unity for Sudan .. Unity
While from Jordan, Ali Dahmash points to Sudan's rich resources:
Did you know that 70% of Sudan's Oil production is located in the south.
No wonder John Kerry & US politicians are supporting the division!
And back in Saudi Arabia, Bandar Bin Naif, wonders: A satellite has been launched specifically to monitor the referendum and developments in Sudan.
Is this being done for the love of Sudan or as a blessing for the separation? This post is part of our special coverage South Sudan Referendum 2011.
Because Kazakhstan does not have a clear religious policy, it has become the norm that everyone is entitled to his or her own perspective on faith.
As it was twenty years ago, no one is really bothered by this multitude of views, which is evidenced by the debate on religion and traditions, which recently spilled over into the blogosphere.
The discussion was sparked by the Kara Zhorga dance, which has become popular in the country in the last few years.
Urimtal writes : “I think Kara Zhorga is not just a dance, but a whole phenomenon that has united the nation.
Even Kazakhs who live abroad are taking part.
When our government describes the expatriates in not-so-flattering terms, Kara Zhorga is a kind of response to such criticism.”
Orken wrote a post on the subject :
“Let’s say the dance has roots in Mongolian or Kalmykian culture, but we’re the ones who made it into a national brand.
The Mongols, the Chinese and the Kalmyks didn’t object in any way.
This is why I think it’s a sign of ignorance that many of us have a short memory when it comes to tradition or even bring up Islam as an opposing force.”
In 2011, Kazakhstan will chair the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
Yet there was a discussion not too long ago about a “potential law that would ban the wearing of headscarves.”
Malimetter.org confirms the reports, and points to the causes, or rather, deputy Minister of Education and Science Mahmetkali Sarbyev does :
“Kazakhstan is a multi-confessional state.
If we permit people to wear the hijab, then tomorrow thirty students in a single class will show up wearing something different – and that won’t lead to anything good,” he explains.
Timurr writes that the law will be unconstitutional, since the constitution guarantees freedom of religious expression :
“Given everything that is happening right now, I don’t think our officials and ministers are unaware they are going against the law.
But, if this is the case, why are they doing it?”

Syrian Blogger Maurice Aaek found that state-run media in Syria is publishing false information and half-truths about the protests in Tunisia and Egypt.
He found that Tishreen daily left out the reason Ben Ali left leaving it open to interpretation, and that Al-Baath daily stated that the protests in Egypt are demanding the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, completely leaving out the demands that Mubarak must step down.
This post is part of our special coverage of Tunisia Revolution 2011. Anonymous' poster calling activists to join the attack on Tunisian government sites The Tunisian censor, commonly known as Ammar, continues to wreak havoc on activists' accounts, in a country that has been witnessing a wave of protests since the middle of December.
Just today, activists claimed that the government has hacked into their email accounts, accessing their blogs and social networking sites, and disabling them.
The move seems to have come in retaliation to an attack by Anonymous, which has targeted vital Tunisian government sites and gateways.
The attack on activists' accounts is not something new to Tunisia and its cyber activists.
The country is described as both a police state and an Enemy of the Internet and an oppressor of mainstream media as the World Press Freedom Index gave it a score of -10 in 2010, where it fell from 154th place to 164th worldwide.
"The country is continuing to drop into the Index's lower rankings because of its policy of systematic repression enforced by government leaders in Tunis against any person who expresses an idea contrary to that of the regime," states the report.
According to Gawker, Anonymous, the loosely-organised band of hacker activists and vigilantes, attacked the government sites, including that of the president, prime minister, the stock exchange and several ministries, in protest against Tunisia's censorship of access to whistle-blower site Wikileaks, following the Cablegate affair, and for the country's repressive censorship.
On AnonNews.org, an online forum for the 'hacktivists,' the following announcement in what is now know as Operation: Tunisia, was made:
A time for truth has come.
A time for people to express themselves
freely and to be heard from anywhere in the world.
The Tunisian
government wants to control the present with falsehoods and
misinformation in order to impose the future by keeping the truth hidden
from its citizens.
We will not remain silent while this happens.
Anonymous has heard the claim for freedom of the Tunisian people.
Anonymous is willing to help the Tunisian people in this fight against
oppression.
It will be done.
It will be done.
This is a warning to the Tunisian
government: attacks at the freedom of speech and information of its
citizens will not be tolerated.
Any organization involved in censorship
will be targeted and will not be released until the Tunisian government
hears the claim for freedom to its people.
It's on the hands of the
Tunisian government to stop this situation.
Free the net, and attacks
will cease, keep on that attitude and this will just be the beginning.
A list of the attacked government sites can be found here.
And according to activists on the ground, the government retaliated by 'hijacking' the email accounts of activists, including lawyers and journalists, and accessing their blogs and social networking sites, such as on Facebook, and deactivating them.
Tunisian blogger Astrubal, co-editor of Nawaat.org, says many indications point at a coordinated attack launched by the Tunisian government in an attempt to break into activists' private accounts.
He writes :
Bloggers are under fire of the Tunisian cyber police, they are trying to hack every one who supported #sidibouzid or #OperationTunisia
Mauritanian activist Naser Weddady tweets:
Based on feedback from ppl in #Tunisia a pattern emerges: hacked Facebook Accts were connected to Yahoo mail accounts #sidibouzid #Ammar404
And adds:
#Tunisia activist @benmhennilina & journalist @Sofien_Chourabi r being targeted coz of speaking to foreign media #sidibouzid #Ammar404 While @spiralis1337 warns: Tunisian police hacking Facebook accounts to gather intel http://goo.gl/QYiEu Keep yourself safe #Anonymous #OpTunisia #SidiBouzid
And Seifeddine Ferjani adds:
#sidibouzid the hacking of emails and Facebook accounts, has confirmed the the Benali government is a criminal enterprise
And if this is not enough, in a further development, @nayzek tweets:
RT @nayzek haha Now officials (?) seem to be calling ppl individually to ask them stop sharing #sidibouzid videos on FB :) #opTunisia...

Gabon's political crisis reached new heights on Thursday, as students protested at Omar Bongo University in the capital city, Libreville.
Whereas protests last week involved mostly opposition members, the unrest appears to be developing into a wider social conflict.
Currently the official government headed by President Ali Bongo, son of the late longstanding strongman Omar Bongo, stands accused of election fraud by an 'unofficial' opposition government.
Former Interior Minister and opposition leader André Mba Obame, has declared himself President.
Planned protests in the country have been stifled by the authorities before they can take place.

On Koaci, an African news website, a blogger reports the arrest of another National Union leader in Bitam, North Gabon:
Egyptian opposition figure Dr Mohamed El Baradei paid a short visit to thousands of anti-Mubarak protesters, camped at Tahrir Square in Cairo, a few minutes ago.

Women’s roles in the ongoing Egyptian anti-government uprising have captured the attention of bloggers and citizens spreading information on social networking sites.
The massive number of protesters taking to the streets demanding government reforms has created a tipping point for women’s civic participation in a country where it is risky and dangerous to demonstrate against the authorities.

In "Women Are A Substantial Part of Egyptian Protests", blogger Jenna Krajeski writes that the turnout on the first day of the protests (January 25, 2011) included an unprecedented female attendance.
The grassroots nature of the organizing seemed to inspire a sense of safety.
So why are women so much more involved in this protest, called “The Day of Anger,” than in previous demonstrations against the Egyptian government?
The Facebook-initiated groups are unaffiliated with a major opposition group.
These protests also seemed safer.
Organizers urged those attending to make it a peaceful one, and this became a rallying cry in some areas of the city on Tuesday.
Moreover, Egypt’s educated youth, men and women, were fed up with a government that had not changed at all in most of their lifetimes, and which cuts even the educated off from any opportunity.
And then there was Tunisia.
Suddenly, attending the protest seemed not only worth the risk, but capable of inciting real change.
Daily Beast journalist Mike Gilgio writes that while it is not uncommon for women to be sexually harassed during public demonstrations in Egypt, this time around men were behaving in a more respectful manner towards women in what has been dubbed the Purity Protests - where the idea of rallying around a unifying struggle against The State is more important than gender-based conflicts.
Nour El Refai also echoes the idea of women and men as allies in his blog post "Men and Women Equal in Peaceful Protest Against Mubarak".
The unifying struggle also includes people from diverse walks of life.
For the first time, Egyptians from all walks of life with different socio-economic backgrounds have joined the protests.
Yet women’s courage to step out of the shadows has not been given enough media attention, according to Megan Kearns who writes in "Taking It to the Streets: Egyptian Women Protest the Government Alongside the Men Yet Few Images of Women":
Night after night, women and men have defied the government imposed curfew in Cairo, gathering in Tahrir Square, aka Liberation Square.
A “Million Person March” towards the presidential palace is planned for tomorrow and a nationwide strike planned for Wednesday.
Egyptian civilians say they won’t stop protesting until President Mubarek steps down from office.
And women in Egypt will be advocating for justice too.
But when the media doesn’t show images of women involved, it appears as if they aren’t entrenched in rallying revolutions; they are written out of history.
Women's participation is being documented through social networking sites, such as the Women of Egypt Facebook page created by Barcelona-based Leil-Zahra Mortada.
As of January 31, 2011 at 6:00 pm US Eastern Standard Time (EST), the material on the page included four albums with more than 130 images portraying women of varying ages, including some dressed in burqas, others wearing head scarves and some in more western attire.
A common theme is an expression of anger and confrontation with the police.
A number of these photographs are also making the rounds on photo-sharing websites.
Twitpic users Kardala, Farrah3m and sGardinier retweeted some of the images of the women protesters, whilst photo-sharing applications Plixi and Picasa were also utilized for similar purposes.
The blogs Subterfusex and Seilo@GeekyOgre are also circulating the images.
Independent photographer Monasosh posted photographs of the women protesters on Flickr.

This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011. With the 2011 General Elections barely hours away, one man holds the key to the eternal propagation or termination of the social revolution through the ballot box in Nigeria.
Parliamentary election is to be held in on 2 April and presidential election will take place on 9 April 2011.
UPDATE 04/03: The nation's election commission just announced that all elections would be pushed back a week, due the late arrival of voting materials.
Attahiru Jega, a professor of Political Science and head of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will determine to a large extent the credibility of the polls within these three weeks.
Attahiru Jega, a professor of Political Science and head of the Independent National Electoral Commission.
INEC had a credibility crisis during the tenure of Maurice Iwu, Jega’s predecessor.
In the words of Patrick Utomi (until recently, a presidential candidate of Social Democratic Mega Party):
As is now widely documented and accepted the 2007 election was a farce.
But it was not that it was a farce alone that troubled me.
It was the level of evil in the process and the widespread view that to have a place in politics you had to sell your soul, conscience and dignity.
I was convinced there could be a better way, a different way.
It is therefore not surprising that:
... The person who heads the electoral agency must be seen to be guileless, with an integrity that is transparent and also unbiased.
It is not just enough to allude to the qualities listed above, it is absolutely essential that the perception matches reality.
Living up to expectations, Jega maintained that he will not morph from an umpire to a biased player in the elections.
Get2Central writes that:
Forty-eight hours to the general elections in the country beginning with the National Assembly polls, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Attahiru Jega, declared yesterday that he was not under pressure to manipulate the electoral process in order to give undue advantage to anybody and that even if such pressure comes from any quarters, he would not oblige them.
The electoral boss insists that:
... With the security features, if a ballot box is snatched and swapped, the commission would know.
Also, if ballot papers are swapped or taken to areas they are not meant, the INEC would know.
In the same vein, if result sheets are snatched and fraudulently exchanged, the commission would know.
As such Jega has passed the bulk to politicians and lawyers.
For the INEC, I can say categorically and convincingly that we are ready for the election, the question should rather be, are the lawyers and politicians ready?
We have put all the necessary machinery in place to not only ensure that the election is free, fair and credible, but to also ensure that a level playing ground is accorded all the contestants.
I am doing my best to ensure that all the mistakes of the past are not repeated. ...Consequently, the question is not whether INEC is ready, but whether the other stakeholders are ready.
Our major concerns at this moment are politicians and lawyers.
These are no mere words, coming from one with such intimidating rich background:
...as former ASUU (Academic Staff Union of Universities) President, a respectable civil society activist and a human rights practitioner.
This post on twitter sums up the expectations of most Nigerians as regards INEC chief and the 2011 elections in Nigeria:
I won't lie.
INEC chairman Attahiru Jega impresses me.
Hope he delivers on his promises.
This post is part of our special coverage Bahrain Protests 2011.
Bahrain awoke to a violent crackdown by police on demonstrators camped out at the country's iconic Lulu (Pearl) roundabout on Wednesday.
That afternoon, I boarded a flight from Doha, Qatar, to Bahrain, in part to see for myself what was unfolding in the island nation I once called home.
Hours later, I found myself on a flight back to Doha, without having been allowed out of the airport.
Here is how my story largely unfolded:
View from Bahrain International Airport.

@omarc: Hmm, SMS tweets not workin... at Doha airport, en route to Bahrain.
Guess we'll see if the gov really is stopping people from coming in
@omarc: Asked to take a seat on arrival at Bahrain immigration.
No reasons given, just waiting to hear from them...
Not sure what made them so suspicious - my mixed ethnicity, visas in my passport from Oman to Iraq, or the sponsor on my old Qatar residency...
@omarc: At Bahraini immigration for 1hr, they ask who I work for...
"You used to work for Al Jazeera, right?"
Yes, is there a problem?
"No problem"
@omarc: Hit the 2hr mark waiting @ Bahrain immigration to enter the country.
Journalists from UK, France and Japan sitting here too.
Still waiting...
While some journalists were being allowed in, others - including from BBC Arabic and US-funded Al Hurra - were reportedly denied access.
Mohammed Jamjoom, a reporter for CNN was asked by the Ministry of Information to leave the country.
@JamjoomCNN: I was expelled from Bahrain ... Am now back in Abu Dhabi ... #bahrain
@JamjoomCNN: Was not given a reason for my expulsion from Bahrain ... Was told I was the only CNN team member being asked to leave ... #Bahrain
Jamjoom can be seen in this CNN report speaking about his experience in Bahrain.
Alex Delmar-Morgan, a Doha-based WSJ reporter, was also detained briefly near Lulu (Pearl) roundabout in Manama, while CBS journalist Toula Vlahou reported being targeted by authorities.
As for me:
@omarc: Three hours at Bahrain immigration - now they say the country is not open for visitors, Manama is not safe, and I should go home.
@omarc: Got my passport back after just shy of 5hrs, with a return boarding card marked for 5:30am...
QA kindly rebooked me on 11:25pm flight
While sitting at Bahrain immigration, I didn't have access to the Internet, and instead, live-tweeted the event by SMS.
Upon arriving back in Doha, I found a flurry of reaction to my tweets, which ranged from the concerned:
@realrogerbird: @omarc Hoping for your safety
To the supportive:
@nabeelalmahari: @omarc best of luck mate I hope u all can make it
@bhrabroad: @omarc we can give you all the info you need even if u r at the airport #Bahrain
The skeptical:
@Nninanina: @omarc that proveregime doesnt want any 2 C crimes done against unarmed protesters what differ #Bahrain from Qaddafi using army against ppl
@maljaya3: @omarc By the time you get there, they would have prepared the stage for you to see what they want you to see.
And the downright rude:
@HubiBahrain: @omarc get the hint.... you are NOT welcomed all of you are bunch of liers
Many thanks to those who tried to help, and good luck to the journalist on the ground, trying to cover Bahrain's story in such trying times.
You can read a narrative version of this story on Boing Boing, as well as the full set of tweets & reactions on Doha News.

This post is part of our special coverage Côte d'Ivoire Unrest 2011.
The last two days have been rich in twists and turns in Côte d'Ivoire.
Forces loyal to Alassane Dramane Ouattara, the internationally recognised president of Côte d'Ivoire, and Guillaume Soro, Ouattara's prime minister, began an offensive towards the South and the West of the country.
In less than three days, they succeeded in taking over the cities of Douékoué and reached Yamoussoukro on March 30th.
The Forces Républicaine de Côte d'Ivoire (Republican Forces of Côte d'Ivoire) have entered Abidjan, the main city of Côte d'Ivoire where the incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to step down in December 2010 after losing the presidential election, may still be located.
The Ivorian online community commented on the events, and here is a quick snapshot of a few conversations.
Fear of MACA Prisoners
Maison d'Arrêt et de Correction d'Abidjan (MACA) is the prison of Abidjan.
Following news that prisoners had been released, Léon Guéré (@Cocoloposo) wrote on Twitter on March 31:
the palace and the radio, in the Plateau and residence remain the bastions of Gbagbo according to a diplomat contacted by #AFP
Côte d'Ivoire trending
The recent events in Côte d'Ivoire were closely followed on Twitter, where #civ2010 and Laurent Gbagbo were trending topics in France:

While former Côte d'Ivoire President Laurent Gbagbo is still holed up in a bunker in the country, resisting arrest for continuing to deny his loss of the 2010 presidential election, the participation of France in the bid to oust him is raising reactions amongst French politicians and citizens , as well as within the African community in France.

From Paris to Douala
On April 5, 2011, in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon, Moto Taxi drivers gathered downtown in order to show their support to Laurent Gbagbo.
The following video was posted on Wat TV by Gri-Gri International, a news blog:
manif à Douala contre l'ingérence internationale - la prochaine fois, devant l'ambassade de France ?
Vidéo Gri-Gri-International sélectionnée dans TV/Séries
One of the interviewees in the video explains :
The problem of Côte d'Ivoire concerns all Africans we warn the international community and France to stop what they are doing in Côte d'Ivoire
Referring to what happened in Cameroon during the war of independence in the country, he adds:
Today we are understanding that it's true that France killed our parents 50 years ago
Embassy difficulties
French Defense Minister Gérard Longuet reported to the French Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs on the morning of April 7, 2011.
He reported that the forces protecting Laurent Gbagbo number around 1,000 and explained that the main difficulty regarding the intervention of the presidential palace in Cocody (where Gbagbo is hiding) is the presence of numerous foreign embassies surrounding it.
The latter are fast becoming strategical and tactical points:
200 hommes pour défendre Gbagbo ?
Vidéo LCIWAT sélectionnée dans Actualité
According to Jeune Afrique, the main African French language magazine, 100 Angolan special forces are backing Gbagbo's militaries who are protecting the presidential bunker where the former leader is still hiding.
This post is part of our special coverage Côte d'Ivoire Unrest 2011
The breaking news came in at 1 pm GMT on April 11, 2011: Laurent Gbagbo was arrested at his residence in Cocody, with his wife, Simone, and close entourage.
Five months after he refused to hand the power to internationally recognised new president of Côte d'Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara, the crisis in the country has now seemingly found its epilogue.
The sequence of events from April 10 to 11, 2011
The French presidential office (@Elysée) announced via Twitter that France had accepted to take part in a new military intervention in Côte d'Ivoire on April 10, 2011:
As Julie Owono explained, the battle over the control of Ivorian media is difficult to sort out.
A report from Reporters sans Frontières suggests that RTI might be broadcasting from a mobile truck stationed in a private home (fr).
This post is part of our special coverage Côte d'Ivoire Unrest 2011.
Confusion surrounds the question of who is currently in control of the Radio Télévision Ivoirienne (RTI), the Ivorian national television station.
On March 31, the Republican Forces (FRCI) rebels loyal to Internationally recognised president Alassane Ouattara entered Abidjan, the main city of Côte d'Ivoire.
When they reached the RTI's headquarters they were faced with resistance from Gagbo's Defense and Security Forces (FDS).
The national television station is mockingly referred to as "Propaganda TV" or "LMP TV" because of the preconception that it favors President Laurent Gbagbo, who denies he lost an election in December 2010 and refuses to step down.
RTI has become the stage for a war of control.
The signal was first cut for 24 hours, and on April 1, 2011 Directscoop, a citizen information blog focused on Africa, announced that the signal of the channel was back:

Following the country's largest earthquake in recorded history, Japan is being hit by it's most ferocious tsunami.
People across the country are glued to their TV screens as scenes of a tsunami measuring more than 7 meters in height sweeping away cars and buildings flashes across the news.
Meanwhile, other parts of the world are bracing for the worst, with Hawaii ordering an evacuation of coastal areas and warnings issued in at least other 20 countries.
The Guardian is posting live updates on the disaster.

Young people in Kibera, Kenya, which is known to some as Africa's largest slum, are determined to show a different face of the place where they live.
With video cameras in hand, they scout the streets for stories to show the world how Kibera sees itself.
The project started in April 2010, spearheaded by Map Kibera and Kibera Community Development Agenda (KCODA).
They began with just two young journalists and now the team is up to 14 young people who record the videos, edit and upload them to the web: not only to their own website Kibera News Network but also to Voice of Kibera, a site which maps their videos and also other news sent in by people via SMS and other mediums.

"Former Egyptian television anchor and activist Bothaina Kamel announced on her Twitter account late Friday evening Cairo time that she plans to run for president in the next round of elections, making her the first woman ever to announce her candidacy for Egypt’s highest office", Manar Ammar
This is how Manar Ammar reported the news of Bothaina Kamel running for the Egyptian presidential elections.
Kamel (@basboussa1) has received mixed reactions from Twitter users.
Twitter user @FaresADL could not believe it, so he wrote to Kamel wondering if the news had been confirmed or was just a rumour: @FaresADL: @basboussa1 are you really running for presidency?
Fatma Emam, who is a feminist wrote about the news: @fatmaemam: Bothina Kamel the first and only women candidate for presidency in #Egypt , follow her on @basboussa1 , in solidarity#womenrights #jan25

Mahmoud Salem, aka @Sandmonkey, also wrote in support: @Sandmonkey: @basboussa1 ana ma3aky ya rayessah 3ala fekra. so far u have my vote.
Some people commented on the above video against her running for presidency.
MyHamosa: I'm against us being ruled by a woman Algeriangirls123: I don't think she will even have the minimum votes required to enter the elections!
Radwa El-Shami questioned the reason behind the huge number of candidates running for presidency in Egypt: The number is increasing and I am seriously starting to question the intentions and motives of every person willing to ascend the throne of Egypt.
It is looking more like I can't serve the country unless I am at the top of the hierarchy, unless I am the president.
I admit that I am also questioning who is hankering for power and prestige
Radwa then continued: I don’t know if I am the only one who pessimistically perceives the situation as farcical, and this is the reason am writing.
I am voicing my concerns because I need a reassurance.
I am asking for a well-informed, insightful opinion; I am looking for someone to talk sense.
Just a few months ago, many Egyptians might have wished to see the country's then-President Mubarak in jail, yet almost certainly none of them imagined this wish might come true one day.
However, on Wednesday April 13, 2011, Egyptians woke up to the news of Mubarak's detention first thing in the morning.
Here is how the moment was documented in the Egyptian social media scene.
Celebrating a dictator's detention
The Egyptian writer Ibrahim Farghali compared the moment to that of the first man in space: ...
نتمنى أن نرى مصر قريبا تحتفل بإنجازات شبيهة بمنجزات دول العالم المتقدم
Yesterday, Russia celebrated the anniversary of the first time a human being went into outer space, Yuri Gagarin.
And today Egypt celebrates its former president Hosni Mubarak's journey to prison.
We hope that one day Egypt celebrates similar achievements like those of the first world, and we hope then that the revolutionary spirit continues to exist in the streets.
Zeinobia also wrote a new blog post about the moment, simply titled, "A Historical Moment".
She then elaborated how the president's sons were also detained: Former ousted president Mohamed Hosni Mubarak and his son Alaa and Gamal El-Din are detained for 15 days in jail.
Zeinobia then continued to explain that Mubarak is facing charges of murdering protesters and stealing public money; however, till now Mubarak is staying in a hospital for health reasons.
Alaa and Gamal Mubarak are facing the same charges as their father.
Reactions of the people
Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff documented the moment by his own way, with a series of cartoon drawings.
Mubarak Before and After Jan25 Revolution, illustration by Carlos Latuff
The majority of Egyptian status updates on Twitter over the past couple of days have also been about Mubarak's detention as well. @engmtm: I wish I could interrogate #Mubarak myself :D @Eslam_Foad: Thanks to the guy who writes Mubarak's speeches, without you the revolution wouldn't have succeeded.
In the past weeks, Torah Prison became not only host for Mubarak's sons, but it has also been hosting many of the pillars of Mubarak's regime.
People on Twitter did not miss the chance to mock this fact: @MAkhnoukh: Breaking News: Torah Jail is now called Torah Republic and it's citizens demand their independence.
It's got it's own president, government, and they do not need people there. @Aessameldin: Gamal Mubarak will star in Prison Break's new season, and his wife Khadija will join Desperate House Wives crew.
Various fake Twitter accounts of Mubarak, his family (Suzanne Mubarak, Alaa Mubarak, Gamal Mubarak and his wife Khadija), and his regime (Fathi Sorour, Safwat El-Sharif and Ahmed Nazif) have also been created to make fun of them.
Car carrying banners in celebration of the detention of Mubarak, posted on Yfrog.
Finally, despite all this, and despite the list of Mubarak's anti-achievements written by Ahmed Hayman, some people still sympathise with the former president: @MontuEssam: I swear to God I'm now sad to be an Egyptian, because of what I'm seeing now.
How come the Egyptian people carries all this amount of hatred and will to take revenge!
What's going?
Are we really that bad?
A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the northern Shan State in Myanmar on Thursday, and according to a state-run TV report, the death toll has increased to 74 people, and the number of injured has climbed past 100 people.
According to an updated report from Weekly Eleven, several aftershocks have been recorded in areas near the eastern Shan State spreading fear among the residents.
One resident in Oak Kyin village said on March 26, around 12pm:
There was another earthquake last night and one this morning also.
I don't dare to stay in my house anymore.
The shaking is felt more because my house is ground-based.
Nothing can be predicted because it is a nature event.
I will let fate decide.
Residents also said that because of the earthquake, the death toll in Tarchileik, Tarle, Nar Yaung village, Mine Lin village, and Mine Koe village is estimated to be more than a hundred, with Mine Lin village having the most number of casualties.

In the same report by Weekly Eleven, an aid worker described the situation in Tarle:
Wounded people have been sent to Tarchileik Hospital and Mine Phyat Hospital.
Aid groups from Tarchileik and Kyaing Tong have based their camps in Tarle.
I can say that the situation has calmed down a little.
Reconstructions have begun.
Rehabilitation camps have been opened in Tarle and Nar Yaung village.
An aid worker who went to Tarle, one of the worst-hit areas, was interviewed by The Irrawaddy:
I arrived in Tarle around 10am.
Most of the 3-storey buildings on the side of the road only has 2 stories now. Many 2-storey buildings have also collapsed.
Monasteries were also included in those collapsed buildings.
Some of these buildings are more than 20 years old, so it made things worse.
Not only residents of Tarle, but also the residents in Tarchileik had to sleep on tarpaulins.
When I arrived in Tarle, I saw that some people were clearing the things at their house by themselves.
Some were crying in front of relative's houses.
I also saw some crying because they lost their relatives.
I couldn't ask them anything.
I should say some were lucky to be alive.
The government hasn't done anything yet.
Some were sent to hospitals.
But I didn't go to the hospital so I don't know what's happening there.
As far as I see, I see that there are about 60 deaths in Tachileik.
There were about 20-30 deaths there (in Tarle).
Death toll would be above that.
I donated some materials, instant noodles and water.
I gave all of them to residential officials.
I don't know what they will do with these things.
They have opened temporary shelters.
Those who have relatives go and live at their house.
Now, the highway has been closed temporarily.
They said that it will be going under maintenance.
Another aid worker from Tarchileik said:
The earthquake happened on March 24, 8:25pm.
Some hours after, officials from Tarchileik came and asked me to volunteer so I went with them.
I arrived in Tarle at midnight.
On the road to Tarle, there is one big bridge.
When we reached that place, our car cannot go forward anymore.
So we had to cross the bridge on foot and continue on to Tarle.
The road at the edge of the bridge had moved down about 5 feet.
There was a great deal of destruction.
With some houses, only the roof was visible and the whole house has went down into the ground.
What I had to do there was to send wounded people to Tarchileik hospital.
There is a hospital at Tarle, but that hospital had also collapsed.
So at first, we had to place the patients at the empty yard in front of the hospital and give them treatment.
Afterwards, they were carried by stretchers to the car at the other side of the bridge.
The walk there takes about 15 minutes.
When we get to the other side of the bridge, we can't immediately send the patients to the hospital.
Because we didn't have many available stretchers, we had to take that stretcher back to the hospital and carry another patient.
There wasn't enough cars so we couldn't send one patient to Tarchileik hospital with one car.
Therefore, the patient who was sent first to the car had to wait for other patients to arrive.
Another thing is we had to wait for many levels of officials' approval for clearance in order for the car to leave to the hospital.
That wastes a lot of valuable time.
In the car I had to drive, one patient died when we were about to reach Tarchileik Hospital.
There were people who had survived the earthquake, but died when they shouldn't have because they were not treated in time for their sustained injuries.
It really makes me sad.
U Win Swe, president of Myanmar Geological Society, said to Weekly Eleven:
In the past, strong earthquakes have occured in areas around Shan State.
But it has been awhile since that has happened.
Earthquakes usually reoccur in areas that were previously hit before.
It was only a matter of how frequent.
In areas among the quake fault line, there is a tendency for after shocks to follow after a big earthquake has hit.
He also warned that because the Indian plate keeps pushing into Asia, Myanmar should be on alert for earthquakes in the future.
This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011. Nigerians will go to the polls on 16 April 2011 to elect their new president.
The election was postponed from 9 April 2011 because of organizational difficulties.
In this post we are looking at how Nigerians are using technology to enhance electoral transparency, political participation and good governance.
Take a Stand, Publicly!
Nigerians on social networking sites can take a public stand using Take a Stand website:
TakeAStand allows people to identify publicly with their positions on certain issues.
Take a stand was built to fight apathy, double speak and non commitment by our friends and colleagues on the forthcoming Nigerian elections .
Take a Stand is the 'option A4*' of online voting *Option A4 also known as open ballot is the voting system that was used in the 1992 Presidential elections.
Voters were required to line up behind the candidates they supported.
The 1992 elections is aclaimed to be the freest and fairest election held in Nigeria.
FAQ about Take a Stand:
What is the diffience between this and online voting Online voting is anonymous.
With TakeAStand, you stand by your vote publicly.
Besides, you can stand for only one candidate unlike in online voting where you can use multiple email adderesses to vote for multiple people.
Why are there only 4 candidates when there are about 18 contesting?
Exactly the same reason the 20 premier league clubs do not go to the Champion's League.
However, if enough people email info@takeastand.com.ng requesting for a particular candidate, we will consider.
I am in a position of neutrality therefore I cannot state my position publicly (e.g. military, INEC official) Fair pont.
Journalists are not exempted though, they should balanced, not neutral.
I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account.
I am sorry, that is the only universal public identity tool.

Writing at Ushahidi blog, Linda had this to say about ReclaimNaija:
The reclaimnaija platform, which is driven by the Ushahidi web engine, is a reporting platform set up as a mechanism for grassroots people to get their voices heard on issues of electoral transparency and governance.
The platform makes it possible for citizens to monitor the electoral process and report incidents of electoral fraud and other malpractices simply by sending text messages or calling dedicated numbers in four major languages (Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and Pidgin).

Reclaim Naija is redefining election monitoring in Nigeria:
In addition, the reclaimnaija.net website serves as a one-stop online resource for information on the 2011 elections.
It features all the polling units, senatorial districts and wards, the Nigerian Constitution, information on candidates, the 2010 electoral act, the election timetable, electoral guidelines, certified voters’ registration figures, political parties as well as civic and voter education modules.
For the first time in our history, citizens of this country have a formidable platform for promoting electoral transparency and popular participation.
Citizens were able to positively influence the electoral process.
For instance, a lot of reports came from communities with limited access to registration centres and a couple of such communities had the deadline for voter registration extended by two days.
Reclaimnaija.net has already succeeded in redefining the paradigm of election monitoring in Nigeria. This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011.

This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011. As the 2011 Elections in Nigeria draws near, the blogosphere is fervent with loud screams.
Nigerian bloggers are busy talking but creating a national conversation about the future of their country.
Nze Sylva Ifedigbo starts the New Year with a post disparaging the bomb blasts that sent some Nigerians to an early embrace with their ancestors.
It is pathetic that violence continually reoccurs in Nigeria’s political equation:
It’s the first day of the year that promises to be very exciting.
Top on the list no doubt for most Nigerians is the general elections scheduled for April.
Kick starting the process for this election is the voters’ registration which will commence this month.
How ready are we to make this opportunity count?
Sadly though, our celebration was hijacked once more by some faceless cowards who detonated a bomb in the usually crowded mammy market of the Mogadishu Cantonment (Sani Abacha barracks) Abuja on New Year Eve.
Felix Okoli lays the bulk at the table of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and particularly on its boss Attahiru Jega:
The mantle has fallen on Jega to ensure that the 2011 Presidential and general elections sail smoothly and the results be an honest reflection of the wishes of the great people of Nigeria.
The Voters Registration was a litmus test on INEC unpreparedness to conduct a credible election.
Nigerian Curiosity asserts that:
These first days also raise questions about the preparedness of the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) and its ability to not only register voters within the time allotted but also conduct free and fair elections in April.
Elections are about numbers.
The wave of social media backed revolutions in North Africa has raised the consciousness of many.
It is therefore not surprising that the party primaries were followed with much more than a passing interest.
Nnenna writes that:
In Nigeria, I followed the #PDPprimaries. ...All this time, I was waiting...typing, tweeting... with thousands of other Nigerians all over the world?
Why?
Because the one that wins #PDPprimaries is almost certain to win the Presidency. #PDPprimaries lasted 15 hours.
The final results were announced at around 7 am the next morning.
We kept awake!
Every single count was on web radio, on Twitter, on Facebook.
Feathers Project thinks that the 2011 elections will be different because of the numerous independent election observers in the country.
...the 2011 elections seem to be too important to be left for politicians alone.
Familiar names like Vote or Quench, RSVP (Register, Select, Vote and Protect), If Naija Votes, have assumed buzz status.

This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011.
Nigerians voted yesterday (16 April, 2011) in the third presidential election since the nation transitioned to civilian rule in 1999.
Thus far, the election has widely been declared a success, with only sporadic reports of violence and voting irregularities.
News sources reported a large turnout, orderly queues, and voters waiting until polls closed to make sure their votes were counted.
As Africa's largest nation and a major international oil supplier, Nigeria stands in the spotlight during election season.
Previous elections in 2003 and 2007 were marred by fraud and violence; as a result, high hopes have been placed on this year's polls.
Incumbent Goodluck Johnathan, the former vice-president who assumed office after his predecessor's death last year, is perceived as the frontrunner; his closest competition is expected from Mohammadu Buhari, who briefly governed the country during the 1980s.
Other challengers are former anti-corruption chief Nuhu Ribadu and Kano State governor Ibrahim Shekarau, as well as 16 candidates from smaller parties.
Official results are expected Monday.

Report from the polls
At Bella Naija, Chiedu Ifeozo wrote how he changed his mind about voting in Nigeria.
He said that although he had voted in “every election that was held while I lived in England,” at home in Nigeria he just “didn't see the point,” because of the prevalent assumption that 'Nigerian votes do not count' and 'the winners have already been decided.'
But, like many young Nigerians, Ifeozo changed his mind and headed to the polls this election season:
Regardless of the cynicism, there has been renewed vigor among the people of my generation regarding the 2011 elections.
Various youth coalition groups have gone all out to show that it isn’t only ‘cool’ to vote but have gone as far as giving insight into exactly who was running for the various offices by performing online polls, organizing a debate, and even developing web and mobile applications for easy monitoring of the elections through citizen reports.
Through these processes, the candidates became more than just names and faces on campaign posters.
They became the possible agents of change my country needed.
He then gave a blow-by-blow account of his experience on voting day:
1.04pm: When it was my turn, my heart was beating a little fast, I can’t lie.
We had been educated on how to correctly complete the process for our votes to count, and I didn’t want to make a mistake, certainly not at the last moment.
I handed the official my registration card, and he passed it to another official while he searched for my name on the list.
When he found it, he put some ink on my right thumb and ushered me to the female NYSC personnel from earlier, who tore out two separate ballot sheets folded them and stamped some information on the back.
She then wrote some details as well before handing it over to me and then directed me to the polling booth, a white folded stand with visors on both sides to prevent anyone from seeing me make my choice.
I made towards the ballot boxes, one for the senate and the other for the House of Representatives, put my ballot sheets through the slot and I was done.
I had voted for the first time, and honestly the first thing that crossed my mind was, “that wasn’t so bad now was it”.
5.15pm: I saw the result of my polling unit on the internet.
My lips stretched into a smile….. “this is is the beginning of a new day for my country.”
Nigerian polling agent.

In a post titled “A different kind of war,” Salisu Suleiman wrote about how the election season interrupts the business of daily life:
All schools were closed down.
No form of teaching or learning took place for the duration.
When it was discovered that the private school the president’s children attend did not close down along with others, public outcry forced it to close down also.
After the initial two weeks, an extension was sought and granted.
So for an entire month, all primary and secondary schools in the whole country were shut.
Even in tertiary institutions, not much activity took place.
In that one month period, every Nigerian aged 18 and above was practically drafted to put down their names and fingerprints at various centres.
Government said it was a civic duty.
Preachers harangued citizens on the need to perform this divinely inspired responsibility.
Parties tried every trick known and unknown to get people to these centres.
Civil society groups made sure they were not left out and they shouted loudly on the need for citizens to participate in the noble exercise.
Public holidays were declared in several states to ensure that the details of all eligible citizens were captured.
Sophisticated digital equipment, worth over USD 500 million, were imported.
At the end of one month of frantic activity, including a week’s extension, over 73 million gallant Nigerians had voluntarily participated in the noble cause.
Imnakoya expressed a cautious optimism shared by many in the blogosphere:
People came out to vote, voted, and even waited for the votes to be counted, without being intimidated by gun-trotting hoodlums, as was the case 2007.
This appears to be the case across most South-western region of the country.
This is a significant shift from the last election.
Writing at NigeriansTalk, Kunle Durojaiye agreed:
One cannot deny that there is a sense of a wind of change.
People voted, and waited behind to witness the counting and collation of votes; media stations ran a live coverage of the elections while it lasted, and very importantly, young people influenced the exercise with the flood of information available via twitter, facebook and blackberry messaging.
Without mincing words, change is inevitable, but one just wonders if the stage is truly set. Read election day diary by Global Voices author, Nwachukwu Egbunike, which describes his day at the Polling Unit in Agbowo, Ibadan, Oyo State.
The Nigerian parliamentary election was held last Saturday, April 9.
The presidential poll was held yesterday, April 16.
The vote for state governors is scheduled for April 26. This post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011.
More money was promised to Saudis today, following an address by King Abdulla to the nation.
In a short address, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques thanked clerics, writers and the Ministry of Interior for their efforts in defending the kingdom.
Following that, a series of royal decrees were read by an announcer,outlining how billions of dollars would be spent to provide better housing, jobs and health care to Saudis.
An anti-corruption committee would also be formed; Saudi workers would benefit from a minimum wage; and military and police officers would get the promotions they deserve.
The speech drew a lot of attention from netizens, before, during and after it was read.
On Twitter, the hashtag #sakingspeech became a worldwide trending topic.
The speech comes following calls, and small protests, for reforms in the Kingdom, where clergymen earlier urged Saudis not to ride the protest wave engulfing the region as such protests in Saudi Arabia were against religion.
Coincidently, one of the royal decrees issued today was the setting up of a new religious body to handle fatwas (religious edicts).
Here are some of the reactions to the Saudi monarch's speech and decrees from Twitter:
@khalidalkhalifa: HM King Abdalla of Saudi Arabia will be speaking shortly on Saudi TV .. World pay attention
@afaliq: If I had to summarize the kings speech in five words "thank you - here's more money" #SAkingspeech
@jenanmoussa: #Saudi king speaks about new orders.
2000 saudi riyals wll be given monthly to unemployed people. #KSA
@Matthias_Sailer: #Saudi King orders a series of financial benefits to its citizens: bonus payments, higher minim. salary, etc. via SultanAlQassemi #KSA #Gulf
@Saudiwoman: 16billion to health ministry to build cancer units and other specialized units, clinics and housing for major hospitals
@schaefdogschaef: SAUDI KING DECREES BUILDOUT OF 500,000 HOUSING UNITS...still cheap to stay in power!!
@AnasAlaoui: “Saudi King Order 7- anti-corruption organization established linked directly to the King, no one is excluded at all from its investigation”
@bagadood: 8th Royal Decree: increase the assistance for private hospitals to 200 million SAR #SAKingSpeech #SaudiMataleb
@Redbelt: In my opinion, the minimum wage decree for saudis is very bad in the long run. #ksa
@alnitak250: #Saudi King offering lots of money/economic benefits but so far no real democratic reforms
@mahmoodali1: #Saudi king could've TWEETED his speech in just 140 characters! #lol #ksa #Bahrain #GCC
@beleidy: So the Saudi King speaks for minutes, and then gives the people more money and jobs
@alhefzi: #SAKingSpeech, where in the hell were ALL THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY!?!?!?! =) =)
@SBassam: So far, no major orders from the King.
I'm still hopeful though!! #Saudi
@Nuha_Nofal: We're gonna run out of money! woooo #SAKingSpeech
@YazzNafjan: #SAKingSpeech is a trending topic, second time in a week a saudi thing is trending. #Awesome

@asahi_chousa:
On Friday 25th March, several Kenyan bloggers held a meeting in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the newly formed BAKE ( Bloggers Association KEnya).
The meeting was the 4th in an initiative by some of Kenyas veteran bloggers.
There have been numerous complaints, accusations and in some instances, outright battle of words simmering between the blogger community and the mainstream media with cases of plagiarism, copyright infringement and a general lack of appreciation by the mainstream media on the impact that blogging has had in generation and delivery of news and information content in Kenya.
This standoff has been aptly covered in a recent blogpost by Jacque Ndinda titled, WriteThinking: Plagiarism-masters of copy paste.
Kenyan Bloggers at a previous Barcamp.
Photo source: Njeri Wangari Her main bone of contention is in how the mainstream media owners are downplaying this as the culprits when exposed through numerous emails to the editor do not receive any disciplinary action.
More often than note, a simple “we are sorry”, is offered to the blogger with no discussion on compensation or acknowledgment.
This, among other issues, as well as opportunities for bloggers were some of the items in the agenda at the Friday meeting.
The turnout was quite impressive with more than 20 bloggers in attendance.
Most were attending for the first time as the original members had been caught up in other matters.
A blog post by Kachwanya, one of Kenya’s most prolific bloggers, laid out the full agenda as well as the aim and objectives of the association.
Our aims will be primarily
1.Create and promote high quality online local contents and innovations
2.Create viable online Marketing channel for the Kenyan companies
3
Have fun online
One of the things that received a lot of emphasis was the need to build a community where bloggers supported each other and worked closer together to achieve a common objective which is to provide relevant and useful local content online.
During the discussion on revenue generation which most bloggers didn’t view as an incentive to their blogging quest, most admitted that despite signing up with international online advertising companies, there was very little to show for it with most eventually withdrawing from the service.
Thus the association will among other things, come up with a more realistic and relevant ad platform that will involve local advertisers.
This, it was noted, would be more effective and would earn bloggers that extra penny which though not sought desperately, would afford bloggers some stipend.
Wanjiku, one of Kenya’s veteran bloggers, announced that she had registered the domains www.bake.co.ke and www.bake.com for use by the BAKE community.
Some of the activities that BAKE is organizing are:-
Activities
• Bloggers expo after every three months.
• Bloggers meet up or happy hour every month.
• Blog competition on topical topics with huge rewards at the end for the winners
• Blog Awards at the end of the year
Bloggers in attendance were informed that Collins Mbalo who runs the blog ‘A Nairobian’s Perspective’ and a fellow Global Voices author, would offer his advice on legal matters like plagiarism and copyright infringement among others.
Many agreed that this is a great initiative and that it was about time that Kenyans bloggers started speaking in one voice.
We thus look forward to see a lot of good things coming forth in the days to come.
There was already some rumors that a large corporation is in negotiations with BAKE for the sponsorship of the first Bloggers Expo.
Let us hope that this will spur growth in not just blogging but also in the relevance of the content.
This post is part of our special coverage The Death of Osama Bin Laden.
Picture of Khulood Al-Khamis from her Twitter account
So what does it take to make a woman fall in love with someone like Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden?
Apparently, a long beard, admits Kuwaiti female columnist Khulood Al-Khamis, who stunned readers with a love letter she wrote for the terror mastermind, who was killed by the US, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, this week.
In her letter, in her column in the Kuwaiti Arabic daily Al-Qabas, Al-Khamis described Bin Laden as the man of her dreams, describing how she would have loved going with him to his cave, washing his beard and becoming one of his wives.
She ended her article promising to wait or him in heaven to continue her Scheherazade tales.
The columnist, who happens to be a short story writer, has an account on Twitter .
Her article shocked many readers.
On Twitter, Al-Khamis received a lot of sarcastic mentions, including from Ayman Zawahari, a parody account of the Al-Qaeda second man, who asked her a simple small question:
#kholoudalkhamees ('Cause Ur a freak, baby) U want it bad, bad romance With #OBL I got a whole new perspective on lady gaga song
Molten86 wrote with a serious tone:
On the 6th of April, officials of a branch of the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) - the Rapid Intervention Force (FIR) - used violence to put an end to a protest by the employees of the private security firm Group Four Security (G4S).

On Facebook, the jurist Hbro Chipas says that the workers strike was illegal, for not having been convened according to "what the law calls for".
Chipas analyses the case, claiming that there are "two perspectives" on the attack:
Nigerian Governor Kayode Fayemi is on Twitter, Nigerian blogger Lord Banks reports.
Pradeep Kumar Singh posts pictures and news of the recent Facebook campaign titled “Show up.
Stand up.
Speak up.
Else, shut up”.
Around 400 Nepali youth showed up at Maitighar Mandala on May 8, 2011 to demand a new constitution.
Faheem Haider at Pakistan Foreign Policy Blog questions what the Pakistani Military and Intelligence Service knew about the top terror Osama Bin Laden, who was intercepted and killed in Abbottabad, near the Pakistan capital.
A Unesco report cites the "heavily regulated" mainstream media in Singapore while recognizing blogs and other new media sites as offering "alternative discourse on important socio-political issues like domestic politics, rights of gays and senior citizens."
As uprisings continue across the Arab World, several incidences of angry young people have sprung up on Senegalese websites.
Since early March, this activism has left the web behind and a group calling itself "Y'en a marre" (Enough is Enough) has now become the main symbol of the protests.
Founded in January 2011, Enough is Enough arose from frustration built up during power cuts that brought Senegal to a standstill.
The group hails from the Dakar suburbs and is led by several local rappers, including Fou Malad, Thiat (from the group Keur Gui) and Matador.
An article on Afrik.com explains the story behind the movement .
The group does not hold anything back on its Facebook page:
The time has passed for moaning in your living room or futile complaining about power cuts.
We refuse to accept the systematic rationing imposed in our homes to supply electricity.
We're sick and tired of it.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
﻿﻿The group has now transformed its discontent at power cuts into a mobilisation movement for young people.
It attacks mass unemployment, police brutality and corruption.
But above all, it tries to make people take part.
On 19 March, Enough is Enough held a protest in Dakar's Place de l'Obélisque (Obelisk Square), using its website to summon young Dakarois there.
The organisers certainly knew how to get their message across: black t-shirts with "y'en a marre" in white letters were distributed around the crowd.
There were also rhythmic, rap-style slogans, and both youth speak and the local Wolof language were heard.
To keep its momentum, the group has given itself a new objective: mobilise young people and give them a voice in anticipation of the 2012 presidential election. The organisers have redefined their message and come up with a new slogan: "ma carte d'electeur, mon vote" ("my polling card, my vote").
On 15 April they launched a national campaign called Daas Fanaanal (a Wolof verb meaning "to protect oneself"), which aims to encourage young people to vote without pledging allegiance to any particular party.
Many young Senegalese have shown their support for the campaign on Facebook and Twitter, such as this post by Mamadou Dieye:
Enough is also enough because the majority of the 1.4 million young people of voting age will not register on the electoral roll.
They're always quick to complain but never do anything about it.
Y'en a marre will only succeed in the challenge it has set itself if it helps to wreck the Interior Minister's plan to leave all young people who don't support the Government off the electoral roll!
Enough is Enough does not hesitate to slam President Abdoulaye Wade's government, and the government is not sitting idly by.
The group claims to have been put under a lot of pressure, and says it has received threats from the authorities.
One press conference was cancelled when the landlord of Janeer, the bar in which it was supposed to take place, was pressurised by police.
The police also seized loudspeakers seized at a rally on 19 March, 2011, in the city of Rufisque, close to Dakar, despite the fact that the group had been granted official permission to hold the event.
Thiat, one of the leaders of the group, explains that it is first and foremost a movement of citizens, not an anti-Wade movement:
We are on the side of neither the President nor the opposition, we are on the side of the people and we are creating a movement which guards and upholds the respect of democracy and the institutions of Senegal.
If the "enough is enough" movement is closer to the opposition right now, its founders have said that's because we're taking on the concerns of the citizens.
The group wants change.
Period.
Its growing popularity has made it April's catch of the month .
The group instantly responded :
Y'en a marre is not a fish.
Small fish in a big pond, or mini revolution?
The real extent of its impact on the 2012 presidential campaign will be known soon.
The fact remains, only the rappers of the Dakar suburbs are speaking out.
During Senegal's last presidential election campaign in 2007, the only passing mention of youth issues arose from the "Concrete Generation" movement.
Its figurehead was Karim Wade, the then 39 year-old son of President Wade.
To say that young people are missing from Senegalese politics is an understatement.
Enough is Enough is not a call for the overthrow of the government, and it talks the line of democracy and non-violence.
Its revolution will affect every ballot box in Senegal.
These events confirm that the Senegalese people believe in the power of their ballot papers, but above all that the next presidential election campaign has long since begun, and this time, Senegal's youth will not settle for a role as mere spectators.
Singapore’s ruling party, People’s Action Party (PAP), released its election manifesto on April 17, 2011, which was immediately criticized by many bloggers for being “too vague.”
PAP has been in power for five decades already.
The country's General Election will take place on May 7.
The PAP manifesto promises a better future for all Singaporeans
You can count on the PAP to do the best for Singaporeans from all walks of life, and to keep us united through good times and bad.
Together, we will make Singapore a vibrant and inclusive society, with opportunities for a better life for each and every citizen.
We will be a city for the young and old.
To achieve this vision, we seek your mandate to:
• Create opportunities for higher incomes for all
• Improve the lives of lower-income Singaporeans
• Bring out the best in every child
• Develop a vibrant city and an endearing home
• Help our seniors stay active, healthy and engaged
* Involve all Singaporeans in shaping our future
The manifesto mentioned about the commitment of PAP to respect diverse views in society.
But Mr. Brown complained that commenting is disallowed on the PAP video site.
Lucky Tan is not impressed with the manifesto and warns that the proposed solutions have been done before:
In fact, where solutions are cited in the manifesto, they are what the PAP has been doing in the past decades e.g. retraining of low income workers from one low income job to another etc.
When the same solutions are used, we will only get the same results - widening income gap, rising cost of living and a deteriorating quality of life.
Through the Wordle site, alvinology compares the PAP manifesto with the manifesto issued earlier by the opposition Workers’ Party’s (WP).
The PAP document consists of 25 pages compared to the 63 pages in the WP manifesto.
Bloggers also noticed that the WP manifesto has detailed recommendations in 15 different policy areas.
Yawning Bread criticizes the leadership brand of PAP:
It’s getting very tired.
And what the PAP does not realise is that this constant harping about the risk of failure has actually damaged Singapore.
Far from making us a confident, innovative society willing to try new things and benefitting from experimentation, it has made us risk-averse and slightly paranoid.
It’s hardly any wonder stress levels in Singapore are so high
Blogging for Myself accuses PAP of being ‘clueless’ to the current realities in the world:
In one word, the PAP is CLUELESS.
I am not expecting some grand theory that is good enough to help illuminate mankind into the future, but they do not have a sufficient grasp of the driving forces today beyond being bewildered by it all and can only say this: The future is highly uncertain.
The PAP has been short changing themselves because they are apt to choose people they trust rather than the ablest.
You know the dynamics of human relationships, it is impossible to have a large company of people that you can develop deep trust.
Molly Meek publishes an annotated document of the PAP manifesto.
She also described the manifesto as a defense of the status quo:
The PAP Manifesto is ultimately about maintaining the status quo, making it cosmetically and statistically better but substantially worse.
Expect minor tweaks but do not expect them to translate to any palpable benefit for Singaporeans; do not expect anything near a paradigm shift in thinking.
(And no, of course there’s no groupthink in the PAP.)
Nigel Tan is disappointed that the manifesto contains only vague promises:
The document seems to contain a series of vague promises, with neither details of specific policies nor information on how the various stated aims were going to be implemented.
As elections get nearer, netizens are encouraged to post photos of the elections in the GE2011 Media website.
This post is part of our special coverage Uganda: Walk to Work Protests. Ugandan police have responded to the past month's ongoing Walk to Work protests by spraying protesters with tear gas and live bullets.
During a demonstration on Tuesday, they took a different tack, firing water cannons filled with pink liquid at demonstrators who were attempting to walk to Constitution Square in the center of Kampala.
Uganda's New Vision Newspaper tweeted a photo of opposition leaders covered in the paint. yfrog Photo user flashdancer11 shared the photo below:
Some bloggers pointed out the irony of the government spraying protesters pink — a color often associated with the gay and lesbian community — given the anti-homosexuality bill currently making its way through Uganda's Parliament.
Blogger Afrogay writes:
...might this also be a subliminal response to the leader of the opposition, Kizza Besigye, for pledging four months ago to decriminalize homosexuality if elected?
To which AfroGay would say to the head of the military guys drenching opposition in pink: thanks guys but the pink color is really just a metaphor.
There is no need to take it too literally.
The hashtag #pinkstuff is also popular topic in the Ugandan Twittersphere:
@Rosejackson3: So illegal to #walk2work in UG w/o permit. If you drive, windows smashed & tear gas to face.
If you fly, blocked.
If you stand-#pinkstuff
@ishtank: On the other hand, think of the stories we'll tell our great-grandchildren. "Kaaka, where were you the day #pinkStuff #trended on #Twitter?"
While many found the "pink stuff" humorous, others are still upset at the government's treatment of protesters.
Blogger KellyUganda writes:
Why does this seem incredibly Hitler/Nazi-esque to me?
As if people don't have the right to demonstrate!
I don't know how Museveni can even pretend to be running a democracy.
No doubt these people are being sprayed pink so that police can harrass and interrogate them and abuse them in the effort to crush their spirit of civic duty and freedom of expression!
In a post titled "Turning Pink," another blogger, Rhino, laments the government's actions:
I'm starting to dislike my government very much, it shows so much fear, infantile logic and an alarming willingness to resort to violence.
That is not what I want from it.
I want it to be just, to inspire me to be a better person and to help me create a better place for my kin and I to live in.
I don't want it to threaten me with death should I choose to differ in opinion and practice, if that is the society it wishes to create, then I would rather not be party to it. This post is part of our special coverage Uganda: Walk to Work Protests.
This post is part of our special coverage Uganda: Walk to Work Protests. Uganda opposition leader Dr.Kiiza Besigye was re-arrested in the capital Kampala for participating in the Walk to Work Campaign one night after he was granted bail.
Besigye had been granted bail on the condition that he would not engage in the campaign that has put the Ugandan regime in the headlines for three weeks now.
The protests led by the opposition are aimed at high fuel prices which have led to high food prices and President Museveni is defiant that he will not intervene to reduce prices.
The protests have so far left five people dead and dozens injured with bullets.
Today was the fourth time Besigye was arrested, this time with more show of force by the military and police.
Besigye’s car windows were smashed with gun butts and teargas and pepper spray were sprayed in the car before her was thrown on a police truck.
President Musveni's main challenger was later taken to Kasangati Magistrates Court where he was released on a non-cash court bond of Ushs. 5 million (aprox. US $2,100).
Protests broke out again today against the violent arrest of Besigye, and more than 100 people have been injured by police.
Unconfirmed reports indicate that 3 people may have died.
Ugandans online have been reporting diligently on the Walk to Work campaign.
Twitter and Facebook users were enraged by the manner in which Besigye was arrested.
On Facebook
Facebook users expressed worry about the increasing police brutality.
Don Wanyama said:
Seen the pictures of Besigye's arrest.
I have never seen this kind of mistreatment.
Break a guy's car and spray him with over 5 cans of teargas??
It is worse than the rape and treason and all other things slapped on him.
It is troubling.
For how long will Besigye take the pain for people who seem comfortable in their misery, who are cowed?
Asiim Blessed Bryans reported on Facebook:
Police is dispassing rioters in kibuli and the place seem to coming normal bt all shops are close its police in control
According to Nicholas Lukyamuzi Radio stations are not mentioning the riots:
Radio stations scared of being closed and thus normal programing nutin with riots z mentioned.
Godgfrey Holidays asked, "What will happen if we run to work?":
New idea no more walking but running to work i wana c if this police guys can handle really . . . .
On Twitter
The twitter hashtag #walk2work has been used to report on the campaign and from the time of his arrest in the morning, tweets were coming with different updates and opinions.

South Africa's most controversial character and politician Julius Malema has been suspended from the ANC for five years.
Julius Malema is the former president of the African National Congress Youth League.
Last year, Malema led students in singing an old anti-Apartheid struggle song called 'Kill the Boer' and a South African judge found him guilty of hate speech because of comments he made about a woman who accused President Jacob Zuma of rape.
In May 2010, Malema was forced into making an apology to the nation and attend anger management classes.
He then changed the song 'Kill the Boer' to 'Kiss the Boer'.
Malema is regarded by his supporters as the genuine voice of the poor in South Africa particularly with his call for nationalisation of South African mines.
Fr Stephen's Blog writes about his suspension:
Former President of the ANC Youth League.
Photo released under Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) by Gary van der Merwe.
Julius Malema is to be removed as leader of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) after being suspended from the organisation for five years.
Malema is barred from involving himself in any activities of the ANCYL and the ANC for the duration of his suspension, which came into immediate effect today after Derek Hanekom,the ANC’s national disciplinary committee (NDC) chairman, announced the findings of a disciplinary process against Malema and the league’s top brass in Joburg today.
Malema was not present at the announcement at Luthuli House for the announcement.
He was reported to be in Limpopo writing an exam.
The committee found Malema guilty on two main charges.
One related to a statement he made on July 31 – that the ANC was no longer dealing with issues affecting the interests of Africa.
....
Malema was also ordered to vacate his position as league president with immediate effect.
He has 14 days to appeal…
Hardspear's post on Malema is a simple expression of fear for the future:
First the March for Economic Freedom, well that was lead by Julius Malema, when he wasn't too tired and taking a break in his chauffeur driven beamer .
There is just so much irony in that I'm headed for sensory overload.
Lazy bastard still letting the masses do all the work for him but taking all the limelight for himself.
Vuilblog takes a satirical approach against Malema's followers with a picture of Malema, which has the following text:
You don't have running water, you live in a shack, you ride in a taxi.
I buy expensive cars, I buy expensive houses, I only drink Johnnie Walker.
You still like me.
Thank you for being a $%^&ing idiot
Other posts discuss the image and character which Julius Malema portrays.
Covering what Malema thinks of himself with a hint of sarcasm is 2OceansVibe:
In his recent address at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha, Malema said it was the job of the youth to introduce radical ideas, but bemoaned the fact that these days, one is hauled before a disciplinary committee for “telling the truth”.
This from the man who was in the media again this morning for a using a racial slur against Indians.
Poor Juju.
He really just feels misunderstood and unsupported.
Bibliopolit compares Malema to Lady Gaga:
Of course, here in South Africa, we have the equivalent of Lady Gaga in Julius Malema!
Just in the political scene.
Should we call him Julius Gaga, or Lady Malema?
If it were not for Malema’s outrageous statements and claims, he would not have had a fraction of the attention that he is getting currently.
For Malema, if it isn’t going to be controversial, it is not worth saying anything about it, according to how Lady Malema thinks.
Malema thrives on attention, and in my opinion, he falls in the same category as Lady Gaga.
Although he is physically an adult, he has not matured mentally or sociologically to becoming an adult, and continues to crave attention like a 10-year old girl.
And, the only way he can get the attention he so desperately desires, he acts and says things that are controversial.
The Fire in My Eyes gets straight to the point:
Julius Malema has the makings of a dictator.
He encourages the black population of South Africa to procreate and seems to dream of a country where white people are erased.
The way he speaks makes on think of reverse Apartheid and he constantly speaks of white people as the enemy.
He has a huge youth following in South Africa even though he is facing allegations of corruption.
The bad press he has received seems to fuel the fire of his followers and he's become something of a 'saviour' figure for many.
The Property Mag summarises the current state of South African politics in light of recent events:
"The dismissal of two cabinet ministers, the firing of the police chief, the enquiry into the arms deal and the fact that whatever the outcome, Julius Malema has had to go on trial, have all sent out a positive message that South Africa will not be allowed to drift into a chaotic Third World state.
These moves by the President along with the financial minister's new mini-budget, have very definitely restored confidence in a leadership which appeared to be losing control.
So we know where we are now, we still have yet to see what the future holds for Malema and South Africa.

Protests
2011 was a year of popular uprisings.
The end of the year is no different than the past months, with fed up people turning to the streets in their hope to get their voices heard and make a difference.
Kuwait: Stateless Protesters Attacked for Demanding Rights
Police attacked stateless protesters in Kuwait, who were demanding their rights to documents, education, healthcare, employment and naturalization.
Egypt: Women Against SCAF - Who Wins?
Egyptians are outraged at the Supreme Council for Armed Forces continuing brutality and abuse against women; this time they beat and in the process, undressed a veiled female protester, an action which was caught on video.
Egypt: Women Rally for Dignity
A couple of days after the events on the previous video, women marched in Cairo protesting against the abuses to women and also called for the fall of military rule as told in Bahrain: A Bloody National Day, a Funeral and More Suppression.
Iran: Where Is My Classmate?
A student campaign was launched on December 7 to remember all those students who have been unable to return to Iran's universities due to religious or political reasons: some banned, others expelled, some in prison and some of them were killed on the streets.
Support from other places in the world was shown through videos to remember the departed and repressed students.
This video was sent in from Barcelona, Spain.

Saudi Arabia: Netizens Use Online Activism to Draw Attention to Qatif Protests
The month of November marked the return of protests to the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in 2011, as the people of Qatif took to the streets to demand reforms, equality, the release of their detainees, and political freedom as many of their slogans and chants have expressed.
So far, four protesters have been shot dead by security forces as a result.
Occupy Protests Worldwide
See special coverage page.
USA: Uncertain Future of Student Occupy Movement in California
After the pepper spray incident and video, the University of California's participation in the worldwide Occupy movement gained media attention.
They are protesting against a 40% enrollment free increase, the high interest rates for student loans and the decreased availability of state financial aid.
Bahrain: #OccupyBudaiyaSt Continues
Peaceful protesters in Bahrain who are pressuring the government to release political prisoners and pay tribute to the more than 40 people killed by security forces since February have been faced with police attacks, brutality, tear gas, and rubber bullets.
This comes after police were caught on different videos brutalizing 25 protesters on a roof with batons and knives.
Philippines: “Occupy” Protests Overcome Police Brutality
Highlighting the theme “sawang-sawa na tayo (we are fed up),” the campout protest tackled a broad range of issues from the Aquino administration's budget cuts for education and social services, nonstop oil and basic commodities price hikes, land reform, migrant issues, urban poor demolitions, and persistent human rights violations.
Elections
Electoral unrest has also motivated thousands out into the streets.
In Russia the result reporting more than 140% of voters has already become a meme.
And although the Congolese diaspora was unable to vote, they made sure to get their voices heard by the world.
With the elections in Russia, online video has proven a useful tool in documenting electoral violations such as disappearing ink pens, paid voters and inflated turnouts as well as the later post electoral protests.
Posts like Russia: No Violation of Election Violations and Russia: Second Day of Post-Election Protests explain the motives behind the protests such as election results, blogger arrests and also the clashes with anti-activists groups recruited and shipped into Moscow from other regions to demonstrate support for Vladimir Putin.
An example of the electoral violations is the use of erasable pens left in voting booths:
D.R. of Congo: Congolese Diaspora Erupts Against Kabila
The Congolese nationals based outside the Congo demonstrated in front of embassies in several different countries.
Although they weren't granted the possibility to vote in the past presidential and parliamentary elections, they protested to bring awareness to the situation in their country and in some cases to protest the results of the elections and to demand the departure of President Kabila.
International governments have already approached the Congolese government to intercede and stop the violence in their capitals.
Culture
Is culture found in the traditions handed down through generations or is it found in the behaviors and activities which get adopted and followed by the population?
In Mexico, children are growing up believing they are less because of their skin color.
In Cuba, very popular but sexually explicit music gets censored, and in Trinidad, a religious Shia Muslim commemoration has in turn become a festival.
Mexico: The Results of a Racism Experiment with Children
These children demonstrate how pervasive racism has become in Mexico.
All that was needed was a pair of dolls, one light skinned and one dark for children to express how they felt the whiter doll was better, even if they identified more with the dark-skinned one.
Ashura Commemorations Around the World
The Shia Muslim commemoration of Ashura takes place in many places around the world.
In Trinidad and Tobago it has transformed into the festival of Hosay and the ritual is shared with Sunnis, Hindus and Afro-Trinidadians.
Cuba: Reggaeton Hit ‘Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities
A popular reggaeton song which sings explicitly about oral sex has been denounced as obscene by the authorities in Cuba.
The debate on censorship has moved online where people debate on the song's merits as part of the actual culture of the island, whether people like it or not, and the impact the authorities comments will have on the songs popularity.

Several empty chairs in Iran's universities were formerly occupied by students who have now vanished.
Some are deprived of education for religious reasons, such as members of the persecuted Baha'i religious minority, others have been jailed for political activities, killed in the street, or forced to leave Iran.
In the best of circumstances, students have merely been expelled.
This year Tahkim Vahdat, a leading student protest group, called for an "Empty Seat Campaign", all over the world, on December 7, Iran's student day, to remember the victims of lost hope for the wish to be educated.
A Facebook page was launched, and several films were shared on YouTube to display solidarity with departed and repressed students in Iran.
Here are three of them.

A message from Canada for a jailed student
Although the community of Congolese (DRC) nationals based abroad was not granted the right to vote during the November 28, 2011, presidential and parliamentary elections, it has shown its commitment to being involved in the political debate.
Using various online channels, the Congolese diaspora have organised several initiatives to raise awareness amongst fellow citizens and members of the international community.
Indeed, the diaspora have succeeded in making themselves heard.
On December 7, the ambassadors of France, the United Kingdom and Belgium in Kinshasa pressed the long-time opposition leader and candidate in the presidential election Etienne Tshisekedi to ask his partisans to stop violence in foreign capitals.
Tshisekedi came in second in the polls according to the temporary results announced by the National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI).
According to Nicolas-Patience Basabose, Director of Publication of Le Congo Hebdo (Congo Weekly), who is based in South Africa, the diaspora is still strongly connected to their homeland :
We denounce, accuse and complain against these officials for their support and involvement in the Joseph Kabila government that the Congolese have rejected during the November 28, 2011 elections.
They are criminals in Congo and they are also criminals in Canada and criminals according to international laws. (...) We have information from reliable sources about all the names of all the Canadian public figures whose companies are involved in the illicit exploitation of mines in Congo. Johannesburg also witnessed the march of hundreds of Congolese nationals.
Other protests occured in Africa, particularly in Morocco.
Kim Jong Il, the North Korean dictator who ruled the hermit kingdom for the past three decades, has died at the age of 69.
According to North Korean state television's official report on Monday, Kim passed away from "mental and physical strain" during a train ride on December 17, 2011.
The South Korean Twittersphere erupted with various responses.
Although the death of one of the world's most notorious dictators is something people might welcome, most South Koreans have expressed concern about the instability his sudden death might bring to Korean peninsula.
The South Korean public's initial response to the news was pure shock.
Son Byung-gwan(@sonkiza), a reporter from the South Korean citizen media site Ohmynews, tweeted :
While Madagascar attempts to find a way out of a prolonged political crisis, Malagasy bloggers are discussing the value of foreign direct investment (FDI).
The worth of foreign investment came into sharp contrast when a land deal with Korean investor Daewoo came under criticism and partly triggered the current crisis.
Many Malagasy believe that Madagascar, like many other African countries is rich in natural resources but that the land has been plagued by poor governance and unfair trade deals.
Ten years ago, The Economist labeled Africa "The Hopeless Continent".
Their most recent publication highlights the rapid growth of many African countries' GDP.
Still, the growth is not equally felt throughout the continent.
In fact, Madagascar is projected to have one of the lowest level of growth in all of Africa.
Additionally, the capital city Antananarivo and other cities are currently experiencing frequent running water and power outages that have provoked frustration and outrage among Malagasy citizens.
The current situation is one of the reasons Antananarivo has been ranked as one of the cities with the lowest quality of life in the world by the Mercer’s 2011 quality of living survey.
Having been marred in a lengthy political quagmire, the Malagasy blogosphere is trying to steer the debate away from a political solution to an overall debate on how to re-ignite an economy that has faltered over the past three years.

Making FDI work for Malagasy people
Land deals have been discussed at length in Madagascar as a way to get out of poverty; the aborted Daewoo deal was the most publicized case but similar deals have been implemented without much hesitation or reaction.
The soundness of deals related to the mineral wealth of Madagascar has been recently debated by Malagasy experts.
Blaise Stephen is working at the International Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Madagascar.
He voiced his frustration with the current status-quo in the Madagascar political system that according to him is the main roadblock preventing more bilateral cooperation with foreign investors :
Two students, Jorge Alexis Herrera Pino and Gabriel Echeverría de Jesús, were killed on December 12, 2011, during a protest held by students of the rural school Raúl Isidro Burgos in Ayotzinapa, Chilpancingo, the capital of the state of Guerrero, Mexico.
The protest blocked the highway “Autopista del Sol” which leads to the tourist area of Acapulco.
Contradicting versions of events have been published online, including the version given by the authorities of Guerrero who said this protest was “unusual”, and that “strange agents” not related to the students participated in the mobilization.
La Jornada de Guerrero published a chronicle of the events:
Everything started with a smoke curtain, provoked by the tear gas bombs that came out of the hands of the federal police.
After that came the first gust of bullets form the federal police, who were authorized to proceed via radio.
The second gust, which was longer, came from different hands: ministerial police opened fire against the students from the right lane (of the highway from north to south) It didn't take long for the federal police to aim at the same target.
On the other side, Ayotzinapa's side, the rural students with a daily budget for food of 3.50 dollars, responded with sticks and stones.
The domestic bombs that they had weren't used because they didn't have time to load them with gas from the 2 gas stations on of each side of the highway.
Some, trying to defend themselves, had time to light up the bottles they got from the service station.
The police then threw some fragmentation grenades at the students, that by then were seeking refuge in the space between the buses and concrete walls that divide the highway.
There were five grenades in total and none detonated, but they provoked panic .
The only ones not moving were two students, both 22 years old
The normalista school involved in the protest has been historically in resistance and belongs to an old tradition of 'escuelas normalistas rurales', which are schools that form teachers from very poor and disadvantage communities.
The school in question belongs to the Federación de Estudiantes Campesinos Socialistas de México (Federation of Rural Socialist Students of México).
Journalist Diego Osorno, who specializes in social conflicts, wrote a story for the blog Nuesta Aparente Rendición about the normalistas conflict in Guerrero , specifically the school of Ayotzinapa.
The school issued a communique in which they denied having any weapons and demand justice for the killings, which they labeled as “extrajudicial execution”.
The text also explains the repeated cancellations of scheduled meetings with the Minister of Education of Guerrero and demand the governor's resignation

On December 13, Justice Authority Alberto López Rosas, during a radio interview with Carmen Aristegui , declared that one of the detainees -who is 19-years-old- had an AK-47, but they didn't know if the bullets matched the caliber that killed the two students.
However he said the weapon is not the kind used by police, and made it clear that the police's actions did not constitute repression, that they only wanted to bring order.
In relation to this,La Jornada published a report about the use of torture to "fabricate" a confession related to the AK-47.
Later that day, López Rosas contradicted his earlier version, saying that the shots might have been fired by the "ministerial police".
But during the events, Roberto Ramirez (@robertoramirezb), head of information of La Jornada Guerrero, tweeted:
@Asteris: Is #Mexico now perceived by int'l media as another Iraq?
Too much quotidian violence to even bother covering it? #Ayotzinapa #Chilpancingo
Hamlet García Almaguer (@hamletgar) blogged in LetraJoven :
The Rwandan leader is widely credited for having put an end to the 1994 genocide that killed over 800,000 people.
In recent years, human rights organizations have raised concerns over the country's deteriorating human rights record.
Rwanda President Paul Kagame.
Photo released under Creative Commons (CC BY 2.0) by David Shankbone.
Rwandans activists campaigning for democracy were "chilled to the bone" by this announcement.
The activists believe that President Kagame is pursuing a third term as a strategy to shield himself from future prosecution.
In particular, they identify the recently released United Nations Mapping report that accuses him of war crimes against members of the Hutu ethnic group.
The same report emphasized that the crimes could amount to genocide if proven in a court of law.
Analysts are also alarmed that this decision to seek another term could destabilize the Great Lakes region by leaving no option open to the Rwandan opposition other than to take up arms.
The presidential term limits debate in Rwanda is championed by internal security minister, Sheikh Musa Fazil Harerimana.
Sheikh Fazil is also campaigning for the legal recognition of polygamous marriages, which are currently outlawed.
President Kagame seems to agree with the Sheikh Fazil:
This Sheikh has a right to express himself and it's as if people expect me to go to this person and say 'you shut up.
Don't talk about this anymore.' No.
This is not my business.
On Twitter, Ugandan journalist Timothy Kalyegira scoffed at the decision with an accompanying dose of satire:
@TimKalyegira: Thousands of tearful Rwandans will soon start narrating to world media how betrayed they will feel if Kagame does not seek a third term.
British journalist Ian Birell was equally unimpressed:
@ianbirell: People are free to say they want me to be president again, says Kagame.
They're not free, of course, to say he should go...
But Ian Birell's comments immediately attracted the wrath of the Rwandan ambassador to the United Kingdom, Erneste Rwamucyo, who accused him of western paternalism:
@ErnestRwamucyo: This paternalism and 'know it all attitude' on Africa and African leaders is not good.
A pple out to be respected.
To which Mr. Birell responded:
@ianbirell: There is nothing paternalistic about supporting human rights and opposing repressive & despotic regimes
As the debate raged on, a heated exchange involving several Ugandan journalists ensued.
It all started when Bob Muheebwa asked whether there were other Ugandan journalists apart from Andrew Mwenda and Alan Kasuja interested in interviewing President Kagame.
The journalists wondered why Mwenda and Kasuja are never critical of President Kagame in their writings.
George Bankole's answer was more blunt.
In an apparent reference to both journalists, Mwenda and Kasujja, he said: @Snottyganda: @tijo5 Cos both hve been compromised with Cash incentives @mugumya@TimKalyegira@Gilespies@AndrewMwenda@kasujja
@TimKalyegira: @Snottyganda@tijo5@mugumya@AndrewMwenda@kasujja Others compromised by the sheer flattery of being on casual terms with a head of state.
Andrew Mwenda maintained silence on the issue, but Allan Kasujja later denied the allegations:
@kasujja: @TimKalyegira @tijo5 @mugumya @AndrewMwenda I am amazed at how simplistic your arguments have become.
Can't my motivation be justice?
Again, Timothy Kalyegira responded:
@TimKalyegira: @kasujja It can be justice.
We just find it interesting, this parade of Ugandan journalists singing Kagame's praises.
Rwanda currently has a constitutional two term limits for the presidency.
Each term is composed of a total of seven years, which is the longest single term in Africa.
President Kagame officially assumed office in 2000 although many believe he has technically been in power since the 1994 genocide.

*****
The buzz is growing louder online that Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi, arrested on the Syrian-Jordanian border while on her way to a workshop on press freedom in the Arab world in Amman on December 4, 2011, will be released.
Eight days after her arrest, Ghazzawi was charged with a list of crimes - refuted by the blogging community and described as a farce.
Among her accusations were "establishing an organization that aims to change the social and economical entity of the state” and “weakening the national sentiment, and trying to ignite sectarian strife,” reported the Lebanese Daily Star at the time.
On her Free Razan page on Facebook, supporters made the announcement that Ghazzawi would be freed, citing Syrian lawyer and human rights activist Razan Zaitouneh.
The post does not say when Ghazzawi is expected to be freed.
The Free Razan poster many supporters replaced their Facebook and Twitter avatars with, calling for the release of Razan Ghazzawi
Nadine Ghazzawi, Razan's sister, responds to the news on the above Facebook post saying:
I will keep u all posted, don't worry I won't keep this to myself :)
And she clarifies on Twitter:
@NadineGhazzawi: #FreeRazan #Syria Razan is not released yet, we are still waiting to be official, that's why I didn't post anything yet.
Online, netizens and supporters remain hopeful yet skeptic.
Mohja Khaf tweets:
@ProfKhaf: RazanZ reports that #FreeRazan Ghazzawi's release on bail has been approved.Approved,not accomplished yet. '
Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas says : @waelabbas: News circulating on the release of Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi on bail in Damascus
While Syrian Alaa Khangar tweets : @alkh81: The judge agrees to release journalist and blogger Razan Ghazzawi, according to Heyam Jameel
Dima Khatib sums up all our confusion:
@Dima_Khatib: I keep reading about the release of @RedRazan but I have no real source.
Just tweets.
Any sources out there? #FreeRazan
In addition to blogging, Ghazzawi is an avid Twitter user, who has contributed to both Global Voices Online and Global Voices Advocacy.
She is also one of the few bloggers in Syria who writes under her real name, advocating for the rights of bloggers and activists arrested by the Syrian regime, as well as the rights of gays and minorities.

The 9 December, 2011, is a big day for Tanzanians as the mainland part of the United Republic of Tanzania, Tanganyika, turns 50.
Online, bloggers and tweeps are celebrating and reflecting on the future of Tanzania.
The Dar es Salaam Bloggers' Circle urged bloggers to mark this event by a blog post on December 9:
The rules are simple:
Write a blog post based on the topic.
Hashtag it on Twitter #DarBlogCircle and ##Tanzania50.
Share it here: http://www.facebook.com/DarBlogCircle
Misternv shares excerpts taken from a letter written by Mwalimu Nyerere to his ministers and party officials in 1964:
Official logo for Tanzania at 50.
Image source: the government of Tanzania.
Do they really love being shouted at to get off the road because the President, a minister or a regional commissioner is taking an afternoon drive? (…) Do they really feel a surge of pride and patriotism every time they are expected to stop what they are doing and stand at attention just become some newly-appointed official whom they many not even have seen before is being serenaded with the national anthem? (…) Dignity does not need pomposity to uphold it: and pomposity in all its forms is wrong.
Even if it were proved that the people really enjoyed it – which I very much doubt- it would still be a wrong; and it would still be our duty to put a stop to it and to tell the people that what they had learned to enjoy was wrong. (…)
After pointing out a few things that Tanzania could do better, David Mugo who lived in Tanzania for 18 months, finishes his post by saying:
In conclusion, I still think Tanzania is still one of the greatest countries I have been to in Africa.
The people are definitely the best.
Happy independence day, reflect on what independence you have, what it means to you, to this generation and future generations.
I challenge young people to view things beyond the eyes of our aging leaders.
Congratulations again.
Long live Tanzania and its people.
Tanzanian activist and blogger, Ashura, wonders, "Where are we at 50?":
In the Arusha Declaration of 1967 by Mwalimu Nyerere he stated ‘Independence means self-reliance.
Independence cannot be real if a nation depends on gifts and loans from another for its development…’ lets ask ourselves today does Tanganyika not depend on gifts and loans for her development?
The answer is yes that is why most of the land is sold to foreign company while leaving Tanzanians with neither land nor compensation.
Our government thinks our development will be brought by foreigners in exclusion of Tanzanians, according to Mwalimu Nyerere we cannot depend on foreign company and act as we please!
Its fifty years since Tanganyika got its independence on the 09th of December 1961 the country is almost regress and not progressing at all.
In 1967, £ 1 was worth Tsh.
16.6 today £1 is worth 2650+ this has bad meaning as far as the economy is concerned.
Mwalimu Nyerere celebrating independence.
In celebrating 50 years of independence, The Wayward Press writes:
Right now, our country finds itself at a moment of transition and great uncertainty.
Our politics lacks a sense of direction or grand ideological vision anchoring us forward.
Our leaders seem to be making it up as they go along.
Our knowledge of our history is fragmented and rooted in skewed nostalgic visions of the past.
Our cultural identity is confused, informed more by foreign forms than any sense of a local aesthetic.
To be a contemporary Tanzanian at the moment is to be a person of great potential unclear about what the future holds for him.
The Creatively Maladjusted looks at blogging and social media in Tanzania at 50:
In a country such as Tanzania where media coverage is likely censored or at the very least is inconsistent / unreliable, blogging (and social media generally) open up a whole new world of opportunities.
“Social media can give Tanzanians their own public voices.
That’s the most powerful opportunity I can think of to be frank”- Elsie from The Mikocheni Report blog.
A common (often intended at ending any further conversation) response that I hear in discussions about social media in Tanzania is that most people don’t have access to the internet.
In rural areas where 75% of the population lives, access is without doubt the major challenge (related to poor electricity coverage as well as few and expensive internet cafes), but this situation is rapidly changing from both supply and demand vantage points, with increasingly cheaper internet access on mobile phones and younger generations attracted to the connectivity that social media offers.
In towns I would argue that a large proportion of the population are at least on Facebook, and via links on Facebook probably have much more direct access to blogs / citizen journalism than people living in the West...
Ahmed at VijanaFM asks, "Tanzania at 50 what do we have to show for it?":
I think there is a challenge right now of galvanizing the people to reflect on the past fifty years.
We do remember the good times but are constantly reminded about the bad.
We have immense challenges and, as the saying goes, do Tanzanians feel they are better off today than they were ten years ago, let alone 50 years ago?
The answer is probably no.
I think instead of being nostalgic about the good old days we should really look inside ourselves, both the mwananchi and the leadership and interrogate how we can build a better tomorrow.
This is because I think the majority of us are concerned about what the next 50 years will look like.
Karim Hirji, a professor of biostatics at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, discusses the education system in Tanzania after 50 years of independence:
At the time of Uhuru, not a single doctor was being trained in Tanzania.
Now, my research methods class at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences has 150 students.
My dilemma reflects the situation in most of the subjects taught at my university and, in fact, at all universities across the nation.
Student numbers have expanded sharply, but the number of lecturers and teaching resources have not.
Some universities have a department with 20 or so academic staff, yet none has a doctoral degree We have just gone through a multimillion-dollar curriculum review exercise.
Yet, hardly any department has changed the substance of what it teaches.
On Twitter, tweeps celebrate Tanzania@50 with the hashtag Tanzania50:

Tanganyika gained independence from the United Kingdom on 9 December, 1961, and later Tanganyika formed a union with Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania.
Human rights activist Moncef Marzouki, 66, has been elected as Tunisia's new interim president today.
The opposition figure, who has been imprisoned and exiled under the regime of former President Zeine El Abidine Ben Ali, will stay in power until the new constitution of the country is drafted, and legislative and presidential elections are held.
His appointment drew reactions from Tunisian netizens, who were divided between critics and supporters.
Elsewhere in the Arab world, Marzouki's appointment, which was followed by a moving acceptance speech, was noted by netizens, who cheered on Tunisia's progress towards democracy, wishing the same for their countries.

Tunisia was the launching pad of an Arab revolution which started in the town of Sidi Bouzid when unemployed Mohammed Bouazizi set himself ablaze on December 17.
Since that day, millions of Arabs across the region took to the streets of their cities, towns and villages, calling for democracy, equality, human rights and political, economic and legislative reforms.
Here is a snap shot of reactions from Arab netizens from Twitter.
Yemeni Noon Arabia dreams:
@NoonArabia: I wish one day in Yemen we get to feel proud of the person who "we" choose to be our leader, as the Tunisians are today. #Yemen #Tunisia
@abubakrabdullah: Amazing - Marzouki's speech at the Tunisian parliament today - I hope to see something similar in Yemen one day..
During his swearing in ceremony, Marzouki cried when he mentioned the martyrs during Tunisia's revolution.
Journalist Andrew Hammond reports:
@Hammonda1: #Tunisia president Marzouki chokes up at mention of the revolution's martyrs; cites ongoing struggle of Palestinians, Syrians and Yemenis.
On this, Egyptian Menna Alaa comments :
@TheMiinz: Egypt is not Tunisia because you will never see any one of our officials shedding tears over the martyrs.
And you will never see the Parliament rise up and chant: "If the people wanted to live, destiny would have to respond."
The chant is part of the Tunisian national anthem.
A translation of the full anthem is available here.
Egyptocracy agrees:
@Egyptocracy: Amazing speech by Al Monsef Al #Marzouki.
Congratulations #Tunisia.
You give us hope. #Egypt
And Egyptian Abdelrahman Ayyash laments:
@3yyash: Tunisia made a revolution, they are the genuine and we are the copy ..
Ours sucks! #envy #Tunisia #Egypt #Jan25
Marzouki's blog is available at www.moncefmarzouki.com and he tweets at @Moncef_Marzouki.
Facebook seems to have started playing an important role in Uzbek politics.
However, so far it is more a tool for playing games with fake accounts, rather than an instrument of civil protests.
Planted suicide story?
On 6 December, 2011, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on a suicide committed by a young woman in the western Uzbek city of Andijan.
After coming home on vacation, Gulsumoi Abdujalilova, a 32-year-old university student in Germany, was allegedly interrogated by police for four days.
According to the Uzbek NGO Human Rights Alliance, Abdujalilova was beaten at the police station and forced to write statements against Muhammad Salih, the self-exiled leader of the opposition People's Movement of Uzbekistan (PMU).
The movement was formed in May 2011 from a number of foreign-based Uzbek opposition movements and rights organizations and stated its goal as being the downfall of President Islam Karimov's regime.
Facebook profile picture of Gulsumoy Abdujalilova, which is actually a photo of turkish model Armine Eşarpları
According to her Facebook account, Abdujalilova was a supporter of this movement, and a person with the name Muhammad Salih was among her Facebook friends. That was the reason, some netizens believe, that the young woman came to attention of the Uzbek authorities.
However, the PMU website has stated that Abdujalilova was never a member of the opposition movement.
It’s worth mentioning that Interior Ministry officials in Andijan gave no comment.
Abdujalilova’s relatives (according to her Facebook profile she is married, and Human Rights Alliance mentioned Abdujalilova’s sister who allegedly found her suicide note) have also kept silent.
The story became more perplexing when two days later, on 8 December, the opposition site Uzmetronom.com published an article with the results of a journalistic investigation, carried out by the website.
The author of the article, who remained anonymous, concluded that the entire story is provocation prepared by Muhammad Salih to destabilize Uzbek society and gain international attention.
The story has attracted the attention of netizens.
One of them comments on the idea that it may have been planted by members of the Uzbek opposition in order to smear the Uzbek government.
Other suggest that it was made up by the national security services to show people the dangers of supporting the opposition movement.
It still remains unclear who could benefit from the made-up story and probably this will not be known.
Sarah Kendzior from Registan.net sums up:
it reveals a great deal of how rumor operates on the Uzbek political internet.
The assumption that all information is unreliable, and all sources biased, has had the perverse effect of ensuring that all rumor is taken seriously.
Prime Minister’s fake Facebook account
Another topic that has sparked controversy among Uzbek bloggers was the Facebook account of Uzbekistan’s Prime-Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
His Facebook page, created early in May this year, has about 2,000 friends and identifies him as a 100% Muslim with conservative political views, interested in women and married.
Catherine A. Fitzpatrick from Eurasianet.org comments:
you can see that Mirziyoyev is inspired by Nicolas Sarkozy, Lee Myung-bak, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Islam Karimov.
His gmail address is provided, so write and ask any questions!
Don't expect any cat or dog photos, however.
Others wonder why the Prime Minister doesn’t have a personal page on Uzbekistan’s local social network Muloqot.uz and speculate that the main goal of his Facebook page is to attract a Western audience.
However, after a semi-official statement from the Prime Minister's “offline office” about contacting the Facebook administration with a request to delete the page, it became clear that the account is not authentic.
Dangers of being too public
This is not the first time that high-ranking Uzbek public figures’ names have been used for suspicious accounts in social networks.
Early this May the blogosphere discussed two Twitter accounts which were affiliated with President Karimov’s daughter Gulnara Karimova. The first one, @GuliKarimova, does not exist anymore.
However the second one, @GulnaraKarimova , is active and has over 1,800 followers
As we see, social networks in Uzbekistan are getting used in some games with political background.
Therefore Hugh Raiser from Eurasianet.org warns:
arguments about the dangers of being too public with one's affiliations on public social networking sites remain in force.
It appears that there is no shortage of political revelations for Zambians these days.
In the midst of former President Banda's sons being scrutinized for questionable purchases before the elections, the new President's son Mulenga Sata, is now at the center of controversy following revelations by Committee of Citizens executive director Gregory Chifire that he recently acquired two expensive vehicles worth 1.8 billion Zambian Kwacha (about US$ 200,000).
Zambians weigh in on the revelation at Zambian Watchdog website:
Mpimpa says:
True to the PF political slogan of more money in your pockets, We have not seen this money, we still go to bed having only eaten one meal, and yet our neighbours are buying luxury cars at 1 billion.
What an example Mr. President.
Please walk the talk this is inclusive of your immediate family.
God have Mercy on us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
President Michael Sata's son (holding a camera).
Photo courtesy of Zambian Watchdog. KimZ adds: Mukanwa mukikopo,then why are we questioning RB’s sons if we know that they have that privelledge of acquiring property as children of the sitting President?
Or just because it’s done by the son to the man you love so it’s normal?
Right now,people are demonising Liato over K2.1 billion and Liato has been a Minister for a long time.Mulenga,whose father has not even clocked 90 days in Office has so far spent K 1.8 billion.
You can imagine how much he will spend by the time his father has ruled this country for 5 years.
The article notes that Mulenga's primary occupation was as an importer of dogs for the Zambian market and so Sipho humorously weighs in:
Its sad to see that just because the father is president he has no right to own such a car,if a person like me owns such nobody would know whats happening,i this this publication along with some of the people that comment should show maturity in the way they discus matters of national interest.Normally you read very lousy comments that don’t make sense at all and just because people have an audience every Jim and jack thinks they have news .This man who calls himself a leader of this NGO that i have heard of today for the first time will just bring stories that he probably was discussing with friends in the bar and of course this paper thinks everything is right without credible sources .Shame!!!
Black Doyo defends Sata's son:
Poeple get your facts right! mulenga is a higly qualified civil engineer. this guy is learned.
Netizens have also been reacting to an unprecedented move in Zambian politics after the the president implored law enforcement agencies in the country to investigate his son and encouraged Mr Chifire to report any suspected unlawful activity linked to the first family to the relevant law enforcement agencies.
Discussing this on Tumfweko.com, Tumbo Tumbo says:
HE Sata has done what RB and other Presidents can never do.
Subjecting his own son to DEC and Police is commendable.
Chifire must be very careful, just like some blogs which judge others in newspapers without those accused having an opportunity to respond or defend themselves.
MULENGA Sata is a gentleman.
I hope Chifire has evidence.
HE Sata must also tell and reveal to the nation what has happened to the report he asked about from Cabinet, and investigating wings about DR MITI whose appointment was revoked within 24 hours of being appointed as Ambassador to WHO, Geneva.
A Public feedback to Zambians is crucial just like his own Son, MULENGA.
We have a reliable, fearless President in HE Sata.
Let Miti and MULENGA be cleared from the investigating wings of GRZ!!!
Publicly!!!
Mulenga, through his lawyers, has given Gregory Chifire 48 hours to apologise or take him to court.
Chifire says that he is not intimidated and is just waiting for the police to call him so that he can go and tell them what he knows.
When the website Tumfweko first broke the news last October about the Zambian Central Bank using alternative currency printers other than the traditional supplier De LaRue, it took a long time for the Central Bank to own up to the new arrangement.
However, a few days later, President Michael Sata disclosed that actually the Bank of Zambia under the direction of the then ruling MMD, printed “fake money” which is said to be in circulation.
However, the MMD through its former Finance Minister, Situmbeko Musokotwane, has denied the allegation saying the Central Bank is at is at liberty to print extra money without consulting the Finance Minister or the President because it has the mandate to do so.
After President Sata was sworn in after the September 20, 2011, elections, the Central Bank Governor, Dr Caleb Fundanga was one of the first, if not the first, government official or parastatal chief associated with the former ruling party to have been relieved of his duties.
Strangely, the position has not been filled more than two months later.
President Sata and his PF government have exposed a number of illegal dealings that went on during his predecessor, Rupiah Banda’s reign such as the purchase of expensive Lexus cars, the unearthing of billions of Kwacha from a former’s minister’s farm and other scandals most of which are yet to be proved.
The recent disclosures have been met with mixed reactions with some netizens supporting the government's actions while others expressly disagreeing with the president in the manner he was handling national affairs.
One contributor, KGB, on Lusaka Times suggested that Zambia should change its currency:
20,000 Kwacha note.
Image courtesy of Zambian Watchdog.
Country Men and Women, if what our combined security and law enforcement Officers uncovered at Dishonourable Austin Liato’s farm (ie K2.1 Billion burried under concrete slab) is anything to go by, then the Government must change the currency immediately to avoid uncontrolled inflation in our beloved nation.
There must be more money burried away in different parts of the country.
Therefore we musn’t allow those selfish” ma ” to ruin our economy by injecting fake Kwacha – printed out of selfish motives – into our economy.
Please President SATA change the currency NOW so that they can get stuck with their Billlions of fake Kwacha.
Mr President we are behind you.
Another contributor calling him/herself 'Zambia A Cursed Nation: Another 5 years wasted', advised Sata to quietly deal with the Central Bank:
This man is a liar.
Honestly if there is fake money circulating in the economy we would have seen inflation tripling.
And what have the Cabinet Secretary Joshua Kanganja and Chibiliti at the Ministry of Finance got to do with the printing of money?
Sata please direct your querries to BOZ.
At you age and your so called experience you do not even know how govt works.
Sata you are a very irresponsible person.
This is a very serious matter.
In the most unlikely event that this was true, an intelligent president would have quietly instructed BOZ to mop out the fake currency.
What you have done with this irresponsible accusation is to raise unnecesary alarm in the economy.
Please next time you swear in your tribesmates stick to the task.
We are tired of your endless litany of complaints…eish!
Lundazi Dweller wrote:
It is sad when the president starts to reduce himself to bar talk.
Now that he is president there is no need for him to talk cheap like he used to when he was not president because then he would comment based on rumours.
BOZ changed printers does that make the money fake?
Can he explain to the nation the excess amount of money printed?
Surely I expect more professionalism in the presidency than this
Kasapato, in defence of President Sata, wrote:
All those denying what my presdo revealed are simply showing their hate on the fact that PF won & they are disgruntled (Most likely these are from a party that will never rule Zambia (UPND).Well for your own information the boat has crossed the sea this time and you have remained with your powerless magical hand shake(Hajanza).Learn to live with this fact that sata`s name is in books and even god had a hand in his appointment.It is evident that money was printed and if you are that clever check the currencies and you will see different printer you disgruntled minority!
On Twitter, one tweep was concerned at the rapid rate at which the Kwacha was falling against the US Dollar.
@mosesmafwenko: Today we trade K5210 to $1.
It might be the fake money!BOZ zambia @sandaykc missbwalya @GNdhlovu
After the Zambian Watchdog website reproduced a speech by Bank of Zambia deputy governor, Bwalya Ng’andu, at a money supply seminar at which he disclosed that one of the companies said to have printed money illegally was actually engaged under the late Levy Mwanawasa’s administration, one member of a Facebook group, Issues Concerning Us, had this to say :
As usual we have shouted wolf and what do we end up with?
Something like this
Giesecke and Devrient started printing Kwacha notes in Mwanawasa regime | Zambian Watchdog
www.zambianwatchdog.com Giesecke and Devrient GmbH of Germany started printing the Zambian Kwacha notes during the Levy Mwanawasa administration.
One response under the post by Himalambo Swedish Sianyaka, read:
If this is the experience that Sata claimed he had to run govt then he needs brain check?
The whole issue is so embarasing for a head of state to stand on an ant hill and make noise on issues he has little understand.
Someone needs to tell him to think and analyse issues before opening his mouth.
Another netizen calling him/herself Zambia Iya New on Zambian Peoples Pact Facebook group was not very kind with the conduct of the PF government:
The PF seem to thrive on rumour mongering -first GBM is scared of his own shadow, the Gold scam, the NW chiefs,the ex-Generals and now (fake) or illegal money printing .What is this govt ,let them focus on the fast approaching 90 Day deadline and stop this kachepa business.
We shall not be hoodwinked by focusing on petty issues.Any way this is typical kaponya tactics they grab byour aattention as you look away ,bang they have searched your pocket.Watch out my countrymen eyes on the ball or is it our pockets.
Ba kaponya kwena (these hooligans)!
Chita Matt Nonde responded to Zambia Iya New's comment with a question:
Are saying we were in paradise in the last 20 years of MMD?
Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, Robert Mugabe, 87, was endorsed last weekend by his party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), as their candidate for the presidential elections expected next year.
Mugabe has been in power since 1980.
He has rejected local and international calls for him to quit.
Many Zimbabweans hoped that his ill health and age would force him to leave power.
The ZANU-PF congress quashed all those hopes.
If elections are held next year, Mugabe will be 88 years old and Africa’s second oldest person to stand in a presidential election after the late Kamuzu Hastings Banda of Malawi who was 98 years old when he stood in Malawi’s 1994 elections.
Twitter and Facebook, the two online alternative public spheres that have become the favored platform for Zimbabweans, became the sites of expression of outrage and disbelief.
Robert Mugabe will be Africa’s second oldest person to stand in a presidential election.
Photo released to the public domain by the U.S. federal government. Facebook user Wise Chokuda wrote: the President Cde Robert Mugabe will not retire anytime soon as he was anonimasly endorsed by all provinces as their next year candidate.
This was announced at the close of the 12th ZANU PF People’s Congress in Bulawayo yesterday.
Masamha Tulisticated posted on his wall:
no retirement plans for the Zimbabwean president.
More white farms to be designated for rural resettlement. #Zanu PF congress.
On Twitter, @BrendahNyakudya tweeted a Mugabe quote:
I am lucky that God has given me longer years than others to be with you (Zimbabweans).
I will not let you down,” he (Mugabe) added. #FML
@BrendahNyakudya quipped:
Mugabe says it would be wrong to step down” *Brendah pours ashes on head, dons sack-cloth and spends night wailing at city gates*
@masamhat: Robert Mugabe says no plans to retire.
He thanks God for living long because he can now rule longer##Zanu PF congress in Byo
@mashanubian: “No surprise!
ZANU PF congress endorses #Mugabe as presidential candidate for elections to be held in 2012 or early 2013 #zimbabwe
@clivembayimbayi posted an angry tweet:
Guys tel me, whn is the bastard goind 2 step dwn, I mean Mugabe from Zimbabwe, gyz lets do somthng
@nqabamatshazi added a bit of humour noting something different in a country where citizens have learnt to curse the dark because of the perennial power cuts:
Bulawayo city centre dwellers are having the time of their lives.
Since the Zanu PF conference began , they have not experienced a power cut.
Later, a day after the Zanu PF conference ended, @nqabamatshazi followed up with:
After an uncharacteristic break, power cuts are back with a vengeance in Bulawayo I bet some people wish the Zanu PF conference was still on.
Meanwhile, @IamClaro made reference to the controversial Nando’s advert that the whole world's laughing at:
Hahahaaha NANDO’S Changed their advert from last DIDACTOR standing to LAST STICKTATOR standing! :’ -To Protect Mugabe assassination”
The controversial advert shows Robert Mugabe dining alone at Christmas in a large mansion while he reminisces about "happier times" with former dictators, such as playing water tag with Muammar Gaddafi, making snow angels in the sand with Saddam Hussein, singing Karaoke with Mao Zedong, pushing P. W. Botha on a swing set, and riding a tank with Idi Amin.
This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees. In recent weeks Global Voices has presented to its readers more examples of how citizen media is used to amplify the voices of refugees and displaced people.
However, while blogs and social networking sites clearly have a role to play in empowering marginalized groups, so too do ICTs in general.
MobileActive, for example, is encouraged by the potential for mobile phones to allow refugees to not only remain in contact with loved ones, but to also more easily locate them.
Attention is especially drawn to a special issue of Forced Migration Review which takes an in-depth look at the use of ICTs in this context.
Refugees in Uganda are using SMS and cellphones to reconnect with family members and close friends.

Refugees often experience a compound trauma: The situation that caused them to flee in the first place, as well as the fact that many families become separated during migration.
For refugee's health and well-being and ability to resettle, it is vital to know the whereabouts of relatives, their safety, and their ability to remain in contact.
Today, mobile phones are the most important technology for refugees to find relatives and remain in contact.
The Forced Migration Review Issue 38, The Technology Issue covers technologies for refugees in particular.
Two chapters shine a light on the use of mobile phones among refugees, as well as some of the problems with this tech to find and contact family member such as issues of security, and accessibility.
Deputy UN High Commissioner for Refugees T Alexander Aleinikoff provides an introduction to the special issue:
Superficially at least, today’s refugee camps do not appear significantly different from those that existed 30 or 40 years ago.
Modernisation seems to have passed them by.
But upon a closer look, it becomes apparent that things are changing.
Today, refugees and IDPs in the poorest of countries often have access to a mobile phone and are able to watch satellite TV.
Internet cafés have sprung up in some settlements, the hardware purchased by refugee entrepreneurs or donated by humanitarian organisations such as UNHCR.
And aid agencies themselves are increasingly making use of advanced technology: geographic information systems, Skype, biometric databases and Google Earth, to give just a few examples.
In one article, the example of a tracing project implemented by the Refugee Consortium of Kenya (RCK) in cooperation with Refugees United (RU) is highlighted:
In 1991 Ahmed Hassan Osman* fled the conflict in Somalia, leaving his family in Kismayu, and made his way to Kenya in search of asylum.
Ahmed lived for a while in Ifo refugee camp before being resettled to Colorado in the US where he was granted full US citizenship.
In 1992, his cousin Abdulahi Sheikh arrived in Kenya in search of support. Granted refugee status, Abdulahi ended up in Dagahaley camp in Dadaab.
He believed Ahmed was either in Dadaab or had been there but his efforts to find him were unsuccessful and he soon gave up hope of ever finding him.
In fact, Abdulahi believed Ahmed had gone back to Somalia.
In early 2011 RCK employed Abdulahi to assist the RU project in Dagahaley refugee camp.
Abdulahi registered with the tracing project and began a search for missing loved ones.
Coming across a name that was familiar, he contacted the person through the RU message system.
When he received a reply he realised that, after 20 years of separation and search, he had found his beloved cousin. They exchanged phone numbers and Ahmed called, breaking 20 years of silence.
Today, the two keep in touch regularly and both Abdulahi and Ahmed continue to search for more friends and family members.
Of course, as MobileActive also stresses, some problems with local infrastructure remain an obstacle to the widespread adoption of such systems:
In some areas of Africa, there is no telecommunications coverage.
Workshop participants commented that where it does exist, phone connections are regularly cut off, and some of them had also experienced intrusion in communication such as crossed lines.
The strength of the network signal overseas is weak, and the lack of a reliable or steady source of electricity in a recipient’s country can be a major problem, although this varies by region.
Growth of populations in some areas weakens network strength, due to the drain on power.
Individuals may also have difficulty accessing electricity to charge their mobile phones.
Finding the best technology to use for different family members can be difficult, particularly if they themselves are displaced, because of factors such as the variety of available services, whether the family member could afford them and whether they have the skills to use them.
One participant observed that the majority of their family members overseas needed to access communication technology through others.
One participant described the difficulties she had in contacting her husband in a camp.
She sent money to him to buy a phone but other people in the camp would also use it leaving her often waiting for hours to get in touch.
Cheap options such as email, voice-over-internet or instant messaging may not be accessible or affordable, and access to the internet in Africa is very expensive.
Furthermore, displaced family members overseas may not know how to use these facilities.
From providing refugees with access to information on health and educational opportunities to using Facebook, Gmail Chat and Skype to maintain connections with family members and friends across geographical divides, the issue provides a comprehensive overview of how ICTs are being used.
Ushahidi also gets a mention in relation to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti as well as in general as it pertains to conflict, disaster and refugees.
Indeed, PBS' Idea Lab takes a look at an Al Jazeera and Ushahidi collaboration to connect and empower Somalis separated by conflict and famine:
Somalia Speaks is a collaboration between Souktel, a Palestinian-based organization providing SMS messaging services, Ushahidi, Al Jazeera, Crowdflower, and the African Diaspora Institute.
"We wanted to find out the perspective of normal Somali citizens to tell us how the crisis has affected them and the Somali diaspora," Al Jazeera's Soud Hyder said in an interview.
The goal of Somalia Speaks is to aggregate unheard voices from inside the region as well as from the Somalia diaspora by asking via text message: How has the Somalia Conflict affected your life?
Responses are translated into English and plotted on a map.
Since the launch, approximately 3,000 SMS messages have been received.
For Al Jazeera, Somalia Speaks is also a chance to test innovative mobile approaches to citizen media and news gathering.
In October 2010, MobileActive also profiled a mobile-based project implemented by Refugees United in Uganda with the support of Ericsson, UNHCR and the Omidyar Network, noting that one blog called it "the social network that is more important than Facebook.”
The Technology Issue by Forced Migration Review can be read online here. This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees.
Christmas 2011 in Côte d'Ivoire was different from those of previous years.
Eight months after the change of regime, the authorities wanted to mark it with completely new decorations in the country and by organizing huge fireworks displays on December 30-31, 2011.
A great many Ivorians went out to take advantage of these various spectacles and the supporting technology, and everyone left with souvenir photos.
If it was a good experience for these amateur photographers, that was not the case for Audrey Carlalie .
This young Ivorian student, a professional part-time photographer, saw her photos of the fireworks display published by certain Ivorian newspapers and even the largest online Ivorian information portal - without her permission.
She did not hesitate to complain on her Facebook page, and soon the blogs and other social networks had picked up the buzz.
The Ivorian blogger Edith Brou sets the scene in her blog and explains:
This post is part of our special coverage Global Voices in 2011.
Our top 20 list of most read posts on Global Voices for 2011 includes four from Japan, three from Egypt, and two from the Philippines.
But only one story is about a giant crocodile!
It's been an incredible year for the reach and recognition of citizen media around the world, and that means Global Voices is no longer as lonely a media voice when it comes to reporting tweets and blog posts.
Still, where mainstream media interest wanes, we're the ones who strive to continue documenting what local bloggers everywhere need the world to know.

Some of our proudest moments of 2011 will never be reflected on a top 20 list like the one below.
This year we exceeded 500 active volunteer authors and translators of countless languages and countries, and we've published more than 2,600 long posts and 6,300 short ones in English alone.
Inevitably, many of the stories that don't get as wide a readership as they deserve are from countries that tend to be overlooked in international media.
Unique coverage from across Africa, the Caucasus, Macedonia, the Russian language Internet, Latin America and indigenous rights are among some of the highlights.
See the 2011 regional reviews by our editors and authors for a glance of what you may have missed.
Our Middle East and North Africa team deserves special mention this year.
Throughout protests, blackouts, threats, they have managed to pull though and keep writing.
The bloody images still proliferate, but our authors seek out constructive voices and angles for dialogue.
So often, they've shared local humor and context that is difficult to appreciate from abroad without a guide.
Perhaps for the first time ever, China doesn't figure on our top 20 list of the year.
These are particularly chilling times to blog about controversial subjects - something Global Voices authors in many other countries unfortunately also experience.
This makes the stories that do come from anywhere free speech is frowned on even more precious.

With the following statement, Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Environment and Water Resources Grace Fu sparked off an online controversy amongst Singaporeans:
When I made the decision to join politics in 2006, pay was not a key factor.
Loss of privacy, public scrutiny on myself and my family and loss of personal time were.
The disruption to my career was also an important consideration.
I had some ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living even though I experienced a drop in my income.
So it is with this recent pay cut.
If the balance is tilted further in the future, it will make it harder for any one considering political office.

Following the recent announcement of paycuts for ministers – which many Singaporeans feel are still not enough – Ms Fu's comments angered many who felt that those who go into public service should not do so in the expectation of huge public rewards.
Ms Fu has since come out to say that her statement had been misunderstood, something which I have observed to happen to the ruling People's Action Party members very often:
Teenagers, goths and emos should just step aside.
People’s Action Party (PAP) members are by far the most misunderstood group of people in the world.
It appears as if they can’t say or do a thing without being misunderstood.
If they went to a MacDonald’s to buy a Big Mac with extra lettuce and no pickles they’d probably get Fillet o’ Fish.
Ms Fu's clarification of her statement hasn't been successful in placating irked Singaporeans, as many have observed that she is still extremely well-paid compared to the average Singaporean.
Mollymeek writes sarcastically about how Ms Fu could have been misunderstood:
Because of our inability to imagine the standard of living that would be compromised by a million-dollar salary, it is easy for us to think that she is materialistic.
It is our fault.
She is not materialistic.
She is not demanding a higher pay.
It is just that her standard of living is so inconceivably high that she may face difficulties making ends meet if she were to be paid the average salary of a minister in the developed world.
Ms Fu's comment soon turned into an Internet meme, with people posting their own versions.
Lee Kin Mun writes about his choice to become Singapore's "blogfather" mrbrown:
When I made the decision to be mrbrown in 1997, pay was not a key factor.
Kena lim kopi by ISD, kena sue until tng kor by ministers and having my newspaper column suspended were.
The disruption to my computer gaming time was also an important consideration.
I had some ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living but we did have to sell the car and now I ride a bicycle.
I fear if the balance is tilted further in the future, I will fall off my bicycle.
Joshua Chiang on his decision to join socio-political website The Online Citizen:
When I made the decision to join TOC in 2009, pay was not a key factor (since it was non-existent).
Loss of freedom vis-a-vis ISA , character assassination by the mainstream press on myself and my family and loss of my entire fortunes via defamation suits was.
The disruption to my sanity was also an important consideration.
I had some ground to believe that my family would have more room space at home if I were ever jailed.
Especially when TOC was gazetted.
If the balance is tilted further in the future, it will make it harder for any one considering citizen journalism/activism.
Even Danny the Democracy Bear, mascot of alternative political party the Singapore Democratic Party, weighed in:
When I made the decision to join the SDP, pay was not a key factor.
Loss of privacy, public scrutiny on myself and my loss of personal time were.
That fact that I might be the party's mascot because I'm the only bear there was an important consideration.
I had solid ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living even though the PAP always likes to sue SDP members.
If the balance is tilted further and animals are prohibited to join political parties in the future, it will be harder for my fellow bears to support, let alone join the SDP.
The Tumblr blog 'When I made the decision...' has now been set up to share these variations on Ms Fu's comment.
18 December was the occasion to celebrate The International Migrants Day .
During the current global financial crisis, immigration from developing countries has been blamed by several political parties as the source of unemployment in their countries.
Even though there hasn't been a single study, so far, that has proved that immigration has had in fact a meaningful role in the employment crisis, this belief remains strongly anchored in the minds of many.
Another phenomenon is also strongly anchored in the fabric of many developed societies: the increase in frequency of humanitarian campaigns around the holiday season.
Indeed, at every year's end in the more developed countries, one can observe campaigns that encourage their citizens to make donations to fight poverty in distant, less fortunate countries.
In addition to the recurring images of extreme poverty around the holidays (also referred to as "poverty porn" in the development sector whenever pictures of poor people are excessively exploited by charities), there are some worrying statistics: 1.4 billion people live with less than $1.25 a day.
Despite some undeniable economic progress in many African nations, social inequality is still even more striking on the African continent.
Economists also project that 1/3 of the poor in the world will reside on the African continent by 2015.
In fact, economic hardship is one of the key factors mentioned by the 700 million people worldwide who are eager to leave their countries of origin.

It often seems that the least developed countries just cannot escape the scourge of poverty, apparently powerless against the magnitude of the task at hand.
Moreover, these countries are often reminded of their inability to meet the needs of the population without international support.
Although international aid is a consequence of urgent crises, this situation is often felt as a recurring affront to national pride.
Various experts postulate, however, that extreme poverty isn't inevitable.
The most radical solution to drastically reducing global poverty would be, for many economic experts, opening the borders between countries and allowing workers to migrate where labor is most needed.
Professors Marko Bagaric and Lant Pritchett are two of the first scholars to introduce the concept of "open borders" as a solution to reducing global poverty.
To this effect, Bagaric writes::
Sending resources to impoverished places has merit.
But it is a slow and fickle way of enhancing well-being.
Instead, we directly pursue this aim by freeing up the flow of people so they can travel to where the goods are.
The starvation crisis is simply one of food distribution, not shortage.
The best way to ameliorate Third World poverty is by massively increasing migration to the West.
Left to their own devices many people would gravitate to life-sustaining resources, leading to a rough equilibrium between the world's resources and its population.
Lant Pritchett explains this notion in details in his book: Let Their People Come: Breaking the Policy Deadlock on International Labor Mobility.
He quotes the results of a study claiming that:
Eliminating the planet’s remaining trade barriers would increase global GDP by around $US100 billion.
Eliminating immigration barriers, by comparison, would as much as double world income: that is, increase global GDP by $US60 trillion.
This added wealth would be shared, but the overwhelming beneficiaries would be people who now live in poor countries.
Demonstrations held in favor of the immigrants’ right to work in Paris by austinevan on Flickr (CC-NC-SA-2.0)
The World Bank published a study about immigrants' contribution to the economy of their native countries through remittances from abroad.
The study also shows that remittances are expected to reach as high as 351 billion dollars to the developing countries, and 481 billion dollars globally including the high-income countries.
The study also mentions that:
Needless to say, these non-orthodox theories are questioned by various experts and politicians.
Frank Salter explains that the main concerns come from the inherent dysfunctions of every multicultural society:
Unrestricted migration would harm (Australia’s) national interests in ways documented by scholars in economics, sociology and related disciplines.
Much of the harm is predictable from what is known about the dysfunctions of diversity.
They include growing inequality in the especially invidious form of ethnic stratification Diversity has also been associated with reduced democracy, slowed economic growth, falling social cohesion and foreign aid, as well as rising corruption and risk of civil conflict
From a political point of view, Europe is far from opening the borders, rather the contrary.
In France, the Guéant Act restricts foreign graduates' possibility of recruitment, giving birth to various reactions.
Julie Owono, Global Voices member, describes the implications of this law and the reactions of various African bloggers that see this law as an additional reason to contribute to the development of their countries.
On the Rue89's blog, Owono adds that the Guéant Act also ostracizes financially limited foreign students .
In Africa, only a few experts have studied the concept of open borders, an idea that is, without doubt, too distant from the continent realities to persist.
McGill University philosophy professor, Arash Abizadeh, doesn't encourage the opening of borders, yet states that the current border system can't be justified by a liberal egalitarian logic.
Abidazeh states that if we want to stick to the belief that "All men are born free and equal", the constitution of borders is by itself a violation of such a principle.
Malagasy blogger Sly writes about the risks of opening the borders:
I'm African and while it seems that this would be a good idea there are some drawbacks
-child trafficiking
-drug trafficking
-spread of HIV and other diseases.
-refugees will form camps in more prosperous nations causing some problems.
Having said this some countries in Africa do have open borders with some neighbourig countries.
Sly refers to the fact that opening the borders between Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, in an attempt to increase regional economic integration, raised some major challenges in the region during the recent food crisis.
This concept of using open borders to reduce global social inequalities implies that reducing global poverty would be the highest priority in the world.
It would come before other important considerations such as national security and the national interests of each country.
This theory of Pritchett and Magric certainly has a contentious side that aims to provoke a debate.
However, despite the claims of the international community that wants to reduce poverty worldwide, the open borders solution is only to be considered in specific contexts and won't take precedence over other items on the international agenda.
This post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011.
The year 2011 has been an extraordinary year for Tunisia - a historic year that will be engraved into the memory of every Tunisian.
What started as a spontaneous act of despair in the forgotten and marginalised region of Sidi Bouzid, turned into a popular uprising that would sweep the country, topple the 23-year rule of Zeine el Abidine Ben Ali, and change the face of the entire region as one Arab country after the other picked up the revolution fervour.
A bloody beginning of the year

The year had a bloody and violent beginning.
Authorities responded to the protesters' demands of "employment, freedom, and national dignity" with live bullets, and tear gas, killing more than 300 protesters and injuring many more.

On January 14, 2011, thousands of protesters gathered outside the building of the Interior Ministry in the capital Tunis.
The protesters were chanting "Interior Ministry is a Terrorist Ministry", and "Ben Ali Dégage" (Ben Ali Get Out).
The demonstration which started peaceful, ended up with police violently dispersing protesters.
Later on the same day, Ben Ali fled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The dictator is gone, but what about dictatorship?

Tunisians were keen to cut all ties with the past, and the battle for democracy in Tunisia, did not stop with Ben Ali fleeing the country.
Kasbah square, where the Cabinet building is located, became an epicenter of sit-ins and protests, which sought to overthrow the so hated former ruling party (now dissolved), the RCD (from its French acronym Le Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique, Constitutional Democratic Rally in English), which was associated with corruption and oppression.

October 23, 2011, was a turning point for Tunisia.
Voters waited for hours to elect their representatives, in the first free and fair election of the so called Arab Spring.
Rise of Islamists

The Islamist party Ennahdha won 41 per cent of the votes, and gained 89 out of 217 seats at the constituent assembly.
For liberals, the rise of Islamists in Tunisia, is a threat to the secular values of the state, and Tunisian women's rights, considered as the most advanced in the Arab region.
Moncef Marzouki - New President of the Republic

On December 12, the national constituent assembly elected human rights activist Moncef Marzouki, who was imprisoned, and exiled under Ben Ali' regime, as the new President of the Republic of Tunisia.
As the year comes to an end, protests and sit-ins for democracy, employment, and dignity continue in Tunisia, as heated debates sweep the national constituent assembly, and an interim government presided by Hamadi Jebali (from Ennahdha) takes up duties.
Stay tuned for more Tunisia coverage in 2012.

Iran's President, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, arrived in Venezuela on Sunday January 8, 2012, in his first stop in a tour that will continue to Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador.
His visit has sparked strong reactions on social networks, where users are questioning whether his presence might be of some benefit for the nation.
On Twitter, some criticize Ahmadinejad's presence and the welcoming he received by the Venezuelan government.
Luis Carlos Díaz (@LuisCarlos) writes:
Undoubtedly, two events in Zambia will go down as having shaken the country in seismic ways.
The first was the death of Second Republican President Frederick Chiluba, a maverick trade unionist turned-politician who defeated Zambia’s founding president Dr Kenneth Kaunda who had been in power for 27 years but was swept out of office in the first multi-party elections after 17 years of one party “democracy”.
This is how one Zambian blogger, Munshya, remembered Chiluba:
Here a man without High School education worked hard as a bus conductor to read a few A Level courses which he later admitted to have flanked.
Additionally, not to be outdone by his many challenges, Chiluba went as far as Tanzania looking for opportunities.
When he came back to Zambia in his twenties, he translated the knowledge he acquired while working in the Tanzanian Sisal industry into good use.
He used his courageousness and his fearlessness to become a defender of his fellow workers.
Through the trade union, a diminutive Chiluba had found an opportunity to talk and walk the tallest.
@ictjournalist tweeted:
@ictjournalist: @GNdhlovu i remember him as a person who who started a revolution in Africa which has spread all over
Afriwoman was a little sad:
@afriwoman: Listening to Zambian radio stations, going through pics of #Chiluba's funeral courtesy of @QfmZambia .
Didn't like the guy but a little sad
The second was the defeat of the ruling MMD after clocking 20 years in power and only three years in office of the incumbent president Rupiah Banda who lost to PF’s Michael Sata at his fourth attempt at the presidency.
After his election president Sata, in another political masterstroke, surprised the world when he appointed his long time ally and his party’s vice president, Dr Guy Scott, a white Zambian who has been on the country’s political scene for over 20 years.
Reacting to Guy Scott's appointment, Zambian tweep and blogger @missbwalya noted:
@missbwalya: Zambia is the only African country with a white VP. Wonder how that will be received by “anti-white African” militants.
Image from the ruling Patriotic Front website.
Chiluba’s death, which citizens first learnt of through Twitter, shocked the nation which only three years before, had buried a sitting president, Levy Mwanawasa who died in France after collapsing in Egypt while on international duty.
Chiluba’s death became a hot campaign issue for the MMD whose cadres threatened to beat Sata if he attended the funeral of his once boss under whom he saved not only as cabinet minister but as the MMD’s national secretary.
Sata never set foot at the funeral venue following threats to beat him up by MMD cadres but he unexpectedly turned up at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre where Chiluba’s body lay in state and paid his last respects, viewing it along ordinary citizens, vexing even security officials who did not know what to do with the then opposition leader who was clearly in bad books with President Banda.
By the time the belligerent MMD cadres turned up to sort Sata out, he had already left Mulungushi.
This was probably one move that increased Sata’s stature in potential voters’ minds.
The irony, however, is that Chiluba, before his demise, touted himself as President Banda’s political consultant who vowed to deliver Sata’s perceived regional strongholds to the MMD.
Supporters in a truck celebrate the victory of opposition leader Michael Sata as he was sworn in as the fifth Zambian president.

Related to Chiluba’s death was the presidential election for which the MMD was sure to win with its well-financed campaign vis-à-vis a Spartan and low key campaign strategy of the PF which adopted the slogan “Donchi Kubeba” with donchi being a corruption of the English word, don’t and kubeba being tell.
The MMD government tried to suppress the release of poll results when it became apparent that things were not going their way but netizens where clearly a step ahead releasing the results on Twitter, Facebook and social networks.
President Sata has embarked on a massive investigation of corrupt activities under the previous administration and within a few weeks of commencement of the investigations, security wings dug out billions of Zambian Kwacha from a former minister’s farm.
Several other former cabinet ministers have since been arrested or have had their properties suspected to have been corruptly obtained, seized.
When the scale of impropriety became apparent, citizens started calling for the removal of President Banda's immunity from prosecution.
Netizens also wondered whether the former president implicated himself in his farewell speech.
On Facebook, Gongs Jhala asked:
Do you think RB and his sons will face criminal prosecution?
I found it interesting when he said they did not “knowingly abuse public resources” that mean they abused public resources but did not know they were doing so?
Many netizens weighed in on the fight against corruption:
@lwangamwilu: Some people miraculously acquired wealth in 3 years in office, let them be investigated - Milupi #Zambia
@stevenputter: #Zambia, 1000 bicycles “for personal use” thought it was only God that could be in more than one place at a time, no wonder investigated
Perhaps we should mention the Barotseland Agreement debate, which picked up in 2011.
Long considered a non-issue during decades of one party rule, Barotseland became an issue of political contention in 2011.
Two people were killed in January 2011 after riots broke out in Mongu, the capital of Western Province over reinstatement of the Barotseland Agreement of 1964.
Some activists in the region argue that the Barotseland Agreement provides for separation from the rest of Zambia.
Zambia’s opposition National Restoration Party (NAREP) president Elias Chipimo Jr. has become the country’s first politician to “address” the make believe 1,318 member Facebook Zambian parliament after he was allowed by the “Speaker” to post his end of year message.
The Hon Speaker first posted the following message before he posted Chipimo’s speech:
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
Hon Members.
May we welcome Hon Elias Chipimo, NAREP President to officially address this House by delivering end of year message from NAREP.
As usual, the House ll proceed to debate his address.
Once we get hold of UPND President, Hon HaKainde Hichilema, and also Republican President, H. E. Michael C. Sata, we shall let them address the House.
President Chipimo, its an honour to have you in the House.
You may address this august House.
Part of Chipimo's post reads:

Year-end message from the National Restoration Party (NAREP)
Looking beyond 2011: What the PF administration can start to do in its next 90 days in office
Zambia faces many challenges ranging from poor healthcare, dilapidated and inadequate infrastructure, limited access to quality education and an economy that is still not meeting the development needs of the majority of the people in spite of its strong performance over the last few years.
Tackling these problems will no doubt require long-term focus, energy and vision.
There are, however, 3 pressing issues that require a clear, committed and immediate response: (1) unemployment; (2) corruption; and (3) excessive presidential and executive power.
Although the fight against corruption has been boosted by the PF administration, there has been a lamentable failure to find a formula for addressing each of these issues in a sustainable manner As far as globally defining moments go, the year 2011 belonged almost exclusively to the Arab Spring – that sense of democratic consciousness that seemed to emanate spontaneously from the streets of Tunis and spread like a virus through North Africa and the Middle East.
Sub-Saharan Africa, and indeed Zambia, was not unaffected by these events.
Remote though the idea may seem, the sentiments that prompted the democratic revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya were similar to those that resulted in the conclusive Patriotic Front (PF) victory on 23 September.
Clearly, after 20 in power, something must went seriously wrong within the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) – the party that brought an end to UNIP’s 27 year rule.
A number of “Members of Parliament” in debating the “speech”, hailed the move to engage politicians in the virtual parliament.
One member, Rodger Chali praised the opposition politician for being new media savvy:
Mr Speaker Sir, let me thank Hon. Chipimo for his submission and for being one the the leaders who understands the power of new media.
Let me submit however that, Zambia is not lacking intelligent presidents , but a system which allows provinces and districts to flourish without looking to Lusaka.
I would therefore wish to challenge Hon. Chipimo to champion the cause of a free Zambia from Lusaka control.
This is the only agenda which will bring prosperity.
If he can deliver this one issue before 2016, i can trust him to be president.
Mr Speaker , I would not what to hear that the hon. can only do this if elected president.
Kasololo Chisenga said:
‎
Hon Zapp Speaker Sir indeed presidential candidate Hon.Elias Chipimo raises some important points that are worth debati ng in the house.
I am particularly taken by his suggestion of growing biofules and coming up with a 'new economy ' in Z...ambia.
This is indeed innovaribve and is what is expected from a youthful leader such as him.
It is my hope that such ideas can be ytaken seriously to reduce the leve of unemployment in the land.
On the same issue of bio-fuel, Nicholas Mutalama added:
Hon. Speaker Sir, the exploration of bio-fuel is now extensive in the West and farmers busy utilising this initiative through government and privately funded programmes.
Why does it take us so long to jump on sustainable opportunities such... as these to move forward.
Sir, the previous regimes together with the current administration have focused on programmes that hardly produce anything worthy.....!
This we can do or maybe just maybe, we are waiting for another investor or donor to come to our rescue when clearly through serious fiscal responsibility and accountability would give us the much needed funds for the initial investment.
Zambian People's Parliament (ZAPP) was formed shortly after the September 20 elections which saw an opposition party, the Patriotic Front (PF), unseat the ruling MMD that had been in power for 20 years.
The group was formed on the back of another Facebook group, the Zambian Peoples Pact which campaigned against the former ruling party.
The following is the group’s description:
The Zambian People’s Parliament (ZAPP) is a replication of the Zambian Parliament comprising a cross-section of citizens who constructively discuss, analyze, debate, persuade and agree on issues which border on democratic governance.
Specifically, ZAPP is a place where citizens contribute their voice on Zambia’s democratic governance, political and socioeconomic development.
The essence of these online debates shall be to enable citizens make input into parliamentary and government’s policy and decision-making and provide a fora for issue-based discussion by politically-minded citizens, leaders in our communities and experts thus enabling the group to mold an opinion and influence decision-making.
Mission Statement
The Mission of ZAPP is to engage citizens, leaders in parliament and government, public and private sectors in jointly setting policy direction and ensuring decisions made at all levels reflect the will of the Zambian people to be governed according to democratic tenets.
Vision Statement ZAPP’s Vision is a leading platform for both ordinary and empowered Zambians who freely express themselves and are heard in Zambia’s democratic governance and promotion of socioeconomic activities of the nation.
Citizen journalist Bladimir Sánchez has already received threats for making a video showing the forced evictions of farmers and fishermen protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the department of Huila, Colombia on February 14 and 15.
In less than three days, more than 600,000 people have watched it.
On Publimetro , Camilo Andrés García Cortés states that the video may be making history as the most watched Colombian citizen video, due to its half a million views during only two days.
The Video the Colombian Government Doesn't Want Us to See shows the violent eviction faced by two river bank communities standing up peacefully against the building of the dam, and pulls together the testimonies of those who faced the violence and were injured.
The communities are against the dam construction because it will leave them without livelihoods if the river is diverted for the project.
When describing the clash that injured protesters, both the community members and journalists present describe that there was no violence towards the authorities in spite of the attacks, and that the police restricted the access of journalists, peace observers and human right organizations to the area of the protest.
Since early February 2012, a series of global vigils have taken place in all over the world to express solidarity with Tibetans, following a call from Kalong Tripa Dr. Lobsang Sangay.
As February 22 is the Tibetan New Year, activists are calling for another round of solidarity action.
A map on global vigils in solidarity with Tibetans on February 8, 2012.
In addition, more than 240 have signed up for a Butter Lamp Pray event* to express their solidarity with Tibetans: In Tibet, from 27 Feb 2009 to 19 Feb 2012, 23 Tibetans have self-immolated to protest for a free Tibet and the return of The Dalai Lama.
15 of them had lost their lives.
Under the repressive circumstance in Tibet, self-immolation is an ultimate act of nonviolence demonstration.
Tibet question seems so far away from us, but as a human being, it doesn’t mean that we can do nothing.
At least, we should pray for the death.
One of the spiritual practices among Tibetan Buddhists is to offer a lighted butter lamp that represents the illumination of wisdom and to purify bad Karma.
Following their belief, we shall also light for the Tibetans who have self-immolated and pray for Tibet.

The problems arising from the defective PIP breast implants have led to a profound crisis within the realm of public health, calling into question the values surrounding and resources apportioned to breast augmentation in Latin America.
The first warning bells sounded in the beginning of 2010 with the discovery of numerous cases of cancer linked by the common denominator of breast implants.
As the months passed, the concern has been growing, so much so that many woman have come together on social media websites to air their opinions and share information as well as to organize legal action.

Cases throughout the continent are many.
Nevertheless, we will mention a handful of these cases, women who have been moved to speak out the loudest throughout the Hispanic Web 2.0.
There are still many unanswered questions: Who should pay?
What will happen after the implants are removed?
How high is the risk?
What is the opinion of the victims?
And also: What does it say about Latin America, this extensive demand for aesthetic surgeries in general, and for breast augmentation in particular?
In Colombia, cases abound, and many woman have organized in groups on Facebook.
Two examples of these groups are Those affected by PIP breast implants Colombia and Woman affected by breast implants in Colombia, which also has published a blog, on which some have called into question the accountability of public health institutions:
Anyone following online citizen media closely this month, would inevitably have come across the heated global debate over the Invisible Children viral campaign to stop Ugandan war criminal and rebel army leader Joseph Kony.
While the Kony 2012 campaign certainly received the attention it sought, many Ugandans and Africans felt its message lacked the nuance required by context, and was more focused on raising funds for the organisation's own survival rather than empowering the people affected by the conflict.
Furthermore, many African citizens felt that once again, the narrative of a highly publicized story about Africa centered on a negative story and neglected the upwards trends the continent has been witnessing.
As a counter measure, many people started posting stories on Twitter about "what they love about Africa" with the hash tag #WhatILoveAboutAfrica.
what I love About Africa trending worlwide by Semhar Araia - @Semhar
The initiative, spearheaded by Semhar Araia, a blogger at the Diaspora African Women Network (DAWNS), started to trend worldwide on Twitter on March 13, 2012.
The other side of the story
While no one argues with the merit of exposing the despicable crimes perpetuated by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, the following citizen media commentaries explain why this debate is more than just a "meme war" but a struggle to reclaim the international perception and narrative about an entire continent.
When a group of North Ugandans, the main victims of Kony's crimes, were showed the Invisible Children's video in a public screening, they were not particularly pleased with the content of the video as is seen in an Al Jazeera English video below.
"If people in those countries care about us, they will not wear t-shirts with pictures of Joseph Kony for any reason," says one man interviewed.
"That would celebrate our suffering."
A Ugandan man at another screening says, "There is some kind of people, some NGO, who are trying to mobilize funds using the atrocities committed in Northern Uganda."
The campaign to show the positive sides of Africa has garnered quite a bit of clout as well in the social media scene.
American student and Afrophile Karen Kilberg collected a few of her favorite posts about the meme, and also quotes African blogger Tatenda Muranda on Twitter as to why she wrote the post:

Reclaiming the narrative about the African Continent through social media is not a new endeavor. In 2007, a similar campaign brewed throughout the African social media when several prominent bloggers invited fellow bloggers to weigh in on "Why I blog about Africa". Ivorian blogger Théophile Kouamouo asked in 2008 :
Binyavanga Wainaina wrote a famous essay about "How to write about Africa" in 2005. This essay was turned into a video called "How Not to Write About Africa" narrated by actor Djimon Hounsou:
In view of the long, drown out struggle to portray the positive side of the continent, one might wonder why it is such a challenge to change the global perspective of the continent and why it matters so much to many people. An answer to why it is important to highlight the positive side of the continent was offered during the TED Africa conference by Euvin Naidoo, president of the South African Chamber of Commerce.
He argues that trust is an important component for investments in Africa, and that a better understanding of all the nuances of the continent is required.
He states:
George Kimble said, 'The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.'
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer The first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. It’s made up of 53 different countries.
So to say 'invest in Africa' is a no-go.

Guatemala: Speaking Out on the Genocide of Indigenous Women
Thanks to activists the international courts following the genocide proceedings against Guatemala will be taking into account the violence indigenous women faced for more than 36 years where they were victims because they were women and because they were indigenous.
A documentary and several video testimonials tell their harrowing stories, stories that due to the discrimination the victims faced in their communities and the fear of retribution many kept silent for decades.

Uganda: The Anti-Gay Bill That Won't Go Away
The same bill that was presented in 2009 is showing up again for voting in Uganda:
Uganda has again re-tabled the controversial anti-gay bill.
Ugandan member of parliament, David Bahati, who proposed the bill back in 2009 has again considered tabling the draconian bill but with changes.
He claims to have dropped the death penalty and jailing of family members who fail to report homosexuals to the authorities.
However, under further scrutiny it has been noted that no changes have been made in the bill, and it is still exactly the same one presented back in 2009.
The following video explains the impact this bill will have on the LGBT community as well as their families and friends:
Hong Kong: Videos Against Homophobic Bullying in Schools

and
Spain: Crackdown Against Students Continues in Valencia
In Valencia, school children decided to protest budget cuts that affected their schools, forcing them to carry blankets with them due to lack of heating, in what has been a particularly cold winter in Europe.
Police reacted to the protests violently with students injured and detained; many videos have been made showing the abuses against minors, females and the elderly.
Just a few days after the brutal police crackdown at the Luis Vives Institute of Secondary Education in Valencia , students have again been the target of beatings, pushing and violence from the police at a pacific protest in which they were, precisely, demonstrating against police violence.
This time,the crackdown started on the afternoon with unexpected force.

Brazil: Quilombo Community in Bahia About to Be Evicted
One of the oldest slave descendent communities in Brazil, Quilombo Rio dos Macacos, where around 50 families live, has a date for eviction: March 4, 2012.
The claim for the land comes from the Navy of Brazil, that intends to broaden a condo for its officers in that territory, in the border area between Salvador and Simões Filho, state of Bahia... Descendants of original peoples from Africa who, during colonialism, were taken from their land to become slaves in Brazil, the Quilombolas now see themselves under threat of losing their homes again, despite their right to the land they inhabit enshrined in the constitution.
This short documentary shows the situation the Quilombolas are facing: afraid to leave their houses, unable to move freely and fearing for their well-being, their families and their homes.

Recent events in Latin American prisons that cost the life of hundreds of inmates have people looking into the living situation and overcrowding faced in many penitentiary centers, and analyzing if they are tragedies waiting to happen.
People who are being deprived of their liberty as punishment for their crimes should be guaranteed minimum living conditions, and sometimes these aren't met, as shown in the documentary of life in Brazilian prisons, which also provides possible solutions for this difficult situation.
Among the 1,200 Hong Kong Chief Executive Election Committee members, 689 elected Leung Chun-ying to be the next city mayor on March 25 under the influence and active lobbying of the Liasion Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong.
When the election result was released, thousands of demonstrators protested against the Beijing manipulation of the election process outside the temporary election venue.
The mock civil referendum
Despite the online voting system being attacked by hackers, thousands of legitimate voters (local residents aged over 18) insisted to queue outside polling stations to cast their ballots:
Polling station at Poly University on March 24.
From Facebook Page: Civic Referendum
Facebook user Leung Chau Ming was queued outside one of the polling stations on March 23; he described the touching scene on the Facebook page of the civic referendum event:
THAT IS THE PRESENT SITUATION BUT WE LOOK FOR A CHANGE.
WE DO NOT WANT "PALACE POLITICS-CHINESE TYPE" ANY MORE.
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE COME OUT TO VOTE.
WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT OUR NEXT GENERATION COME THROUGHT ALL THIS AGAIN.
I HOPE LOSO WILL UNDERSTAND.
Eventually, 222,990 people voted in the mock election, in which 54.6% cast blank votes.
Leung Chun-ying only got 17.8% of the votes, a huge contrast with the result of small circle election, which was held in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
Protest outside the city hall on March 25
On March 25, more than 2,000 people protested outside the temporary election venue.
Outraged by Leung's victory, they pushed the police barricades.
Below are some photos taken by citizen journalists from inmediahk.net on the protest scene:

Joshua Wong, a young activist, reflected upon the demonstration and expressed his disappointment with people’s unwillingness to take action:
The earliest forms of newspaper were handwritten and now 'The Musalman' probably is the last handwritten newspaper in the world.
This Urdu language newspaper was established in 1927 by Chenab Syed Asmadullah Sahi and has been published daily in the Chennai city of India ever since.
It is presently run by Syed Asmadullah's grand son Syed Arifullah and six skilled calligraphers work on this four pages newspaper everyday.
With a circulation of approximately 23,000 the paper covers news in Urdu language across a wide spectrum including politics, culture and sports.
With the recent technological advances, where paper newspapers are going extinct because people read them online, this personable touch is rare to find.
The price of this paper is 75 Paise (approximately 2 US cents).
Signboard of the office.
Screenshot from the video The Musalman
MadanMohan Tarun reports:
Presently it is edited by Mr. Syed Arifullah.
He took over the charge after his father died.
His father ran this paper for 40 years.
It was founded by his grandfather in 1927.
This paper has maintained its original look and had not compromised with the Urdu computer font.
Preparation of its every page takes about three hours.
After the news is received in English from its part time reporters, it is translated into Urdu and Katibs – writers, dedicated to the ancient art of Urdu calligraphy, pen – down the whole story on paper.
After that negative copy of the entire hand –written paper is prepared and pressed on printing plates.
Urdu type setting was very difficult; also, typeset work looked ugly in comparison to handwritten work.
Therefore, Urdu resorted to lithography while other languages adopted typeset.
With the advent of computer, Urdu writing got great boost.
It allowed calligraphic writing without the problems of lithography.
Yet, a book or newspaper written by a good katib and properly lithographed is very pleasing and beautiful; computer written Urdu is no match.
How you can be the "biggest loser" in an election just for voting?
Probably Mohammad Khatami, the former reformist president of Iran can answer this.
Khatami voted in the parliamentary election on Friday, March 2, 2012 ignoring preconditions he himself had formulated for his participation: “Freedom of prisoners and creation of a free atmosphere for everyone and all groups, the authorities respecting the Constitution and creation of the logistics for conducting a healthy and free election.”
Given the popular calls for boycotting the elections, many reformists were disappointed to see Khatami go back on his word.
He later justified his actions by expressing hope that his vote did not disrupt "reformist solidarity."
He has reportedly stressed the "complexity" of the internal as well as the international affairs and called for, "understanding of these complexities by everyone."
Several satirical cartoons published on the internet display anger and disappointment with the once popular Khatami.
Nikahang, a leading cartoonist and blogger, considers that Khatami ignored the blood shed during the 2009 protest against regime.
Mana Neyestani, another leading cartoonist, shows one of a character breaking a window on the head of Khatami.
An unnamed guest cartoonist on Khodnevis.org took part in a "cartoons against Khatami" campaign with this entry:

The Iranian Islamic regime has ignored International Women's Day for more than three decades.
It does not recognize March 8, and has even banned women organizations from celebrating the day.
But each year Iranian women both in the real and virtual world stil celebrate.
As international sanctions bite and tension over Iran's nuclear program rises, this year several activists have published videos on the women's rights website Change for Equality saying, "I am against the war."
These activists say:
War is not just bombs and the destruction of our homes.
Even before we embark on a war, it seems that the lives of women have already become more difficult.
War has focused its gaze on women and moves closer, step by step.
We do not want to become the silent victims of this monster.
On March 8, 2012 while being denied the opportunity to celebrate the day or express our demands in the streets, we have taken this opportunity to say that we are opposed to war and each of these short films express our reasons for that opposition.
Reality behind the war photos
No red alert for children
War leaves scars on women
War is a real monster, but unfortunately so is dictatorship and prison.
The Iranian blogger Jaarchi reminds us that 47 women are imprisoned in Iran for their social and political activities.
On this year's International Women's Day, March 8, 2012, a rather unconventional protest was held in downtown Seoul, South Korea.
Female flight attendants of Asiana Airlines, one of the nation's major airlines, held a press conference in front of the Kumho Asiana building accusing the company of having sexist guidelines regarding female flight attendants' appearance.
Park Bong (@jayparkbong), member of a feminist organization, tweeted :
Throughout the night of March 9 and into the morning of March 10, 2012, Israeli warplanes attacked targets across the Gaza Strip, with a death toll of at least 12, and 20 injured.
On the afternoon of March 9, Zuheir al-Qaysi, secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), was assassinated during an Israeli raid on Gaza City, along with his assistant Abu Ahmad Hanani.
Hanani was originally from Nablus and was deported to Gaza as one of the prisoners freed in the prisoner swap deal a few months ago.
In retaliation, Palestinian resistance groups in the Gaza Strip fired rockets into Israel, with no casualties.
Israel came back with severe airstrikes that shook Gaza and left 12 martyrs altogether, identified by Ma'an News Agency as Muhammad al-Ghamry, Fayiq Saad, Muatasim Hajjaj, Ubeid Gharabli, Muhammad Hararah, Hazim Qureiqi, Shadi Sayqali, Zuheir al-Qaysi, Mahmoud Hanani, Muhammad Maghari, Mahmoud Najim, and Ahmad Hajjaj.
Some reports are now saying that 15 people have died.

Gaza's netizens have responded to the attacks on Twitter:
@MaathMusleh: 15 were murdered in Gaza till now, No WORRIES they're just Palestinians!! #GazaUnderAttack
@ectomorfo: Pray for the people of Gaza.
No lights, little medicine, no gas.
And now they're being bombarded from all sides by #Israel. #GazaUnderAttack
@Omar_Gaza: 18 minutes with no explosions!
Cautious silence? is it over? or should I keep holding my breath? #GazaMassacre #GazaUnderAttack
@najlashawa: i dont know how i am still typing that was LOUD! #GAzaUnderAttack
@imNadZ: Welcome to #Gaza.
Where sunshine is explosions.
Where birds are F16s.
This attack comes at a time of shifting regional and political alliances.
Last week, in light of increasing prospects of an American-Israeli war on Iran, two top Hamas officials announced that Hamas would not get involved and support Iran in case of an Israeli attack.
Hamas has also declared its support of the Syrian people in their struggle against Assad.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Zambia recently, addressed parliament, met key political figures among them the first republican President Kenneth Kaunda and visited the country’s prime tourism destination, the Victoria Falls in the southern city of Livingstone.
None of these have made as much news as his call on the nation to respect gay rights.
Reported the Lusaka Times:
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says people with different cultural backgrounds need dignity and respect.
Mr. Ban notes homosexuals, lesbians and gays are people whose rights need to be dignified and respected by mankind.

In his address to the Zambian National Assembly, Mr Ban said:
Now you have embarked on a transformation agenda – a process for a new people-driven Constitution that will be a foundation for Zambia’s progress, a Constitution that will stand the test of time.This offers Zambia an opportunity to lead once more by enshrining the highest standards of human rights and protections for all people – regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability.
His statement brought back into focus the issue of homosexuality for which the then ruling MMD nearly destroyed the then opposition leader, now republican President Michael Sata, during the campaigns leading to last September’s elections which saw him beat former President Rupiah Banda.
Zambia netizens on most social networking sites have reacted differently to Ban’s statement, with most of them invoking the "Christian Nation" tag, which is enshrined in the country’s constitution.
Reacting to the Lusaka Times story (quoted above), Mambala wrote:
hehehe!!!!!
Mr Ban, we expected to hear that from you.
Infact that was yo main agenda… to advance the cause of the homosexual and lesbians.
Listen Zambia is a sovereign state, we dont have to be told how to live.
We knw those homos and lesbians have always been part of our society.
They do their acts in secrecy and we are ok with that.
If they dare come out in the open to advance their evils, we will deal with them ruthlessly!!!!

Please Mr Secretary General, we as Zambians have accepted that we are a Christian Nation, it is in our constitution and so becomes our Right.
Being such means respect for all persons as they are God’s imagery creation – including criminals, homosexuals,lesbians, liars, prostitutes and the like, while at the same time condemning their sinful activities, so that they turn away.
Mr SG, we know you want us to follow other nations by not criminalising homosexuality.
That we shall refuse.
We shall never de-criminalise such acts.
Let those nations copy from us because it is the most sensible thing to do
One of the few contrary voices, Observer, wrote:
Mr Ban is talking about BASIC rights.
He is not talking about gay marrriage or that kind of thing.
Have some of you read the story before commenting?
Basic rights is like the right to clean water or education.
He is saying these people should be allowed to live life free from physical danger and enjoy same basic rights without discrimination.
I do not see anything wrong with that.
These are people too.
Our churches and families should work hard to ensure young people stay away from homosexuality and other negative stuff.
Government can not be tasked with supervising lives of individuals.
It is nice to have our country visited by Mr Ban.
On Zambian Facebook group, 90 days (Government thumbs up/down every 90 days), Sidique Abdullah Gondwe Geloo made a distinction between a sin and a crime:
HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN, NOT A CRIME.
FORNICATION IS A SIN NOT A CRIME.
Should an unmarried man go to jail for having sex with another unmarried women?
They sinned but its not a crime, they made the decision.
Should gay people go to jail for dating...It is a filthy filthy SIN but not a crime...They have rights not be stoned, killed or harrassed, but they shouldnt have rights to get married, display their feelings publicly because we are a very PROUDLY HOMOPHOBIC COUNTRY...So when someone says gay people have rights, that shouldnt scare you as long as they keep their gayism at home
On Twitter, one tweep addressed Ban Ki-moon saying:
@chikwe1: Ban Ki Moona If denouncing #Homosexuality makes me a #Savage then I'd rather #Live and #Die a savage than otherwise.
Stay away from #Zambia
While debate over homosexuality rages in Africa, Liberia and Uganda introduced anti-gay bills recently making homosexuality liable to a death sentence.
Homosexuality is outlawed in 38 African countries and it can be punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan, and northern Nigeria.
The previously featured Creative Commons documentary Runa Kuti on the identity of urban dwelling indigenous descendants in the city of Buenos Aires is looking for volunteers to help them subtitle the documentary into indigenous languages found in Argentina such Quechua, Aymara, Mapuche and Guaraní as well as into English.
On their blog they've posted their call for volunteers:
On 21 March, 2012, a Bangladesh court ordered concerned authorities to shut down five Facebook pages and a website for blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed, the Koran and other religious subjects.
The ruling has also demanded why hosts/creators/administrators of the website/pages should not be be brought to justice for uploading indecent materials.
The most worrying aspect is that the order also asks why the process of shutting down such websites/pages in the future should not be initiated.
Two university teachers filed a law suit earlier complaining that these pages and the site were hurting people's religious sentiments.
Facebook is extremely popular in Bangladesh and there are an estimated 2.5 million Facebook users and the country ranks 55th.
In 2010, Facebook was temporarily blocked for sometime on charges of malicious propaganda against the Prime Minister and hurting religious feelings.
According to reports the accused pages contain disparaging remarks and cartoons about Prophet Mohammed, the Muslim holy book of Koran, Jesus, Lord Buddha and Hindu gods.
Some of the cartoons of the Gods are said to be very close to pornography.
The netizens were slow to react on this as they know that there had been a law suit against an University teacher for his Facebook Status.
Furthermore, there is an increasing pressure on the government to closely monitor Facebook activities as it is being used for all sorts of purposes.
They are also concerned whether this ruling, if imposed, will be used as a precedence to curb freedom of speech of netizens.
Facebook user Tanvir questioned in a note :
Bloggers and activists are advocating for universal access and "minimum acceptable speeds" for Internet connections in Bolivia.
As previously reported on Global Voices, the first National Meeting to Promote Connectivity in Bolivia took place in late January 2012.
After the event, a group of activist continued to advocate, like blogger Mario R. Durán from Palabras Libres , who met with Bolivia's upper Chamber President, Ms. Gabriela Montaño.
The campaign is also seeking to inform and raise awareness on the issues and limitations of the current connectivity conditions.
The group is gathering support at the site Más y mejor internet para Bolivia (More and better Internet for Bolivia).
The website "seeks equality in Internet access for Bolivians Do not dream of super speeds but do demand the minimum acceptable speed".
Wanted - Better Internet Access for all Bolivians.

An infographic that has been circulating on social media platforms shows that Bolivia is among the last places in connectivity and bandwidth in Latin America.
It also shows that in Bolivia, one Mbps costs between 6 and 11 times more than in neighbouring countries including Paraguay, also a land-locked country.
Electric Engineer Sergio Toro, a Bolivian expert on ICT for development, comments on a post by TIC para el desarrollo's blog:
This post is based on content originally posted on WITNESS.
On March 14, 2012, the International Criminal Court found Thomas Lubanga, a former rebel leader in the eastern Congo, guilty of using children in armed conflict - a war crime.
This is a major milestone for international justice, for victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and for video for change.
In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where civil war has taken more than four million lives, children as young as six are routinely recruited by militias and taught to kill.
It is estimated that children, most between 8 and 16 years old, make up 60% of combatants in the region.
A 5-minute video by WITNESS called "A Duty to Protect" was screened early on in the court proceedings, and was credited by the judge for having played a role in the outcome along with other visual evidence.
It tells the story of Mafille and January, two young girls who were recruited into the military.
The video looks at the effects of child recruitment on families and the broader community.
WITNESS staff member, Bukeni Waruzi, originally from the eastern DRC and a long-time human rights advocate, was in The Hague to hear the verdict.
He appeared in a Q&A with journalists following the verdict on March 14 explaining among other things the importance of video in the trial.
In the video below, uploaded by WITNESS to YouTube on March 13, the day before, Bukeni speaks with Madeleine, a former child soldier of the eastern DRC who he demobilized when she was 15 and then adopted.
In 2007, she testified at the UN to share her experiences as a child soldier.
Bukeni and Madeleine discuss their hopes for the outcome of the Lubanga trial and hopes justice will be served for child soldiers everywhere.

As Ghanaians are getting ready for presidential and parliamentary elections that will be held on 7 December 2012, BloggingGhana community has lauched a social media initiative that seeks to train stakeholders to use social media tools for election monitoring and reporting.
GhanaBlogging is a group of bloggers in/outside Ghana who blog about Ghana.
Ghanaian radio broadcast journalist, writer and blogger Nana Sarpong writes about the launching of the initiative:
The logo of Ghana Decides project.

The Ghana Decides-A BloGh Election 2012 Project been launched today at Windy Lodge, Winneba.
Ghana Decides is a BloggingGhana initiative meant to introduce NGOs, Civil Society Organisations, students (especially first time voters), political groups and the general Ghanaian public to the importance and benefit of use of social media tools in elections in Ghana.
The projects seeks to engage these bodies and individuals, train them to use these tools as well as provide a reliable platform for elections monitoring in the country.

Nana continues:
As most innovative projects such as Ghana Decides are typically based in the nation's capital, the project team thought it best to launch outside of Accra.
The launch which was under the theme Encouraging Informed Youth Participation in the 2012 Elections saw participants from Senior High Schools within Winneba, the local union for the physically challenged in Winneba as well as other physically challenged people, students from University of Education, Winneba, NGOs such as Plan Ghana and the general public.
The launch marks the official outdooring of a series of Ghana Decides online and offline activities including the iRegistered campaign meant to propel young voters to go out in numbers, register and take videos or pictures of themselves doing so or after registering.
Currently, the hashtag #iRegistered is trending on Twitter.
The video below from Ghana Decides YouTube channel displays scenes from the ongoing voter registration exercise in Ghana.
Ghana Decides explains more about #iRegistered initiative:
Among Ghana Decides’ activities, is the ‘#iRegistered’ campaign to get Ghanaians to register as the Electoral Commission (EC) has begun the biometric voter registration.
#iRegistered in 4 simple steps;
1. Ghana Decides has provided information on the biometric registration its website (http://ghanadecides.com).
The Government of Ghana website (http://ghana.gov.gh) also has an information leaflet for the biometric registration exercise.
Every Ghanaian is being urged to read, be informed and share this information with family, friends and people in their communities.

Tweet or post a Facebook or Google+ update telling your friends and the world about the registration exercise and the need to register with the hashtags #iRegistered and #GhanaDecides.
The main competition in the December 2012 elections will involve the two main Ghana's political parties, the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the main opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP).
Several Indonesian cities were rocked by protests against petrol price hikes in the past few weeks.
According to local media reports , violence marred some of the protests which resulted in injuries.
Initially, the Indonesian government was planning to raise the petrol price on April 1.
There was no official statement about the adjusted petrol price.
Currently the subsidized petrol known locally as Premium is sold at IDR 4,500 (USD 0.50) per liter.
Without the state subsidy, Premium could cost around IDR 8,400 (USD 0.92) per liter.

Gianrigo Marletta, a Jakarta-based video journalist posted the following video on YouTube.
The protests last month and the active military presence in the cities to secure the protests somehow refreshed memories of the nation's past experience with fuel riots.
Back in 1998, the country descended into chaos following the government's plan to increase the fuel price.
Chinese-Indonesian shop houses were torched by furious mobs, somewomen were raped, student protesters were kidnapped and gunned down, and in the end, Indonesia's longest running president Suharto was forced to resign.
On his timeline, Twitter user @cuapolitik said that it's about time to increase the fuel price.
He reasons:
Media reports within Malawi and all over the world state that Malawi’s President Bingu wa Mutharika is dead.
While there is no official government communication at the time of publishing this, the delay in the announcement has created more belief for the worst .
State Radio Malawi Broadcasting Corporation announced on Thursday evening that Mutharika (reported to have been 78) was taken to South Africa following a cardiac arrest on Thursday morning.
Mutharika has been under heavy local and international pressure to improve political and socio-economic situation for Malawi.
While business went on as usual in Malawi's towns, bloggers and other netizens in social media sites have received the news with mixed feelings.
On Malawi Fuel Watch Facebook group, one netizen wrote:
lol the president is gone and now petrol is being found!
Malawians have been queuing up for hours for fuel since 2010.
While another wrote:
Peter Mutharika , let Joyce take over if status quo remains, we need fuel now...
Bingu wa Mutharika at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.
Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson released in the Public Domain.
Malawian journalist and blogger Rebekka Chimjeka reported that Bingu’s remains were to return to Malawi soon.
She said that Malawi expects Vice President Joyce Banda to address members of the press.
She has been updating her blog with news related to Mutharika's death.
Another journalist Kondwani Munthali refuted reports that Mutharika was admitted at Milpark Hospital in South Africa:
Malawi is at crossroads.
President Bingu wa Mutharika was never admitted at Milpark Hospital as suggested by Government as it has been found.
All indications, medical, DPP, family and others sources indicate the President sadly passed away yesterday and he is at a funeral home in South Africa.
Medical records from Milpark Hospital indicate 16 people were at the Intensive Care Unit this morning at the Hospital and none of the President.
He prayed for Malawi hoping that the constitution will prevail:
There are reports of some people in the ruling party trying to force Parliament to convene and change the constitution not to allow the Vice President to assume office.
It is the prayer of this blog, that constitutional order will prevail and that the Legacy, Honour and Dignity of the President will be honoured by allowing peace and constitutional order to prevail.
The prophecy by Nigerian TB Joshua in February about death of an African president created fears for Malawi and many believers seemed to have intensified that God intervenes in the situation.
*Update 1: Malawi's Vice-President Joyce Banda has confirmed that President Bingu wa Mutharika has died and declared 10 days of mourning.
Under the constitution, Vice-President Joyce Banda takes over.
However, government spokesperson says that she cannot succeed Mutharika because she is not a member of the ruling party.
She was expelled from the ruling party in 2010 after a dispute with Mutharika's attempt to position his brother as his successor.
Malawi Voices reported that army chiefs have agreed to follow the constitution by supporting Joyce Banda:
The Malawi Defence Played a crucial role, General Odillo chaired a meeting with military chiefs and unanimously agreed follow the constitution.
The General Informed Joyce banda, Peter Mutharika and Goodall Gondwe that the army will uphold the constitution anything other than that will not be entertained.
Team of soldiers was on stand-by at Kamuzu Barracks and a few others went to guard the Veep's residence.
This plus US govt direct pressure on Peter Mutharika deflated "Peter and Goodall's plans"
A group of Cabinet ministers appeared at a news conference on Friday night to declare that Vice-President Joyce Banda cannot succeed President Bingu wa Mutharika.
This is the first time Malawi will bury a sitting president.
As the people of Mali were preparing for elections, they were caught unawares by a military coup on March 21, 2012, and the threat of partition of north Mali.
At the time of the coup the principal candidates were readying their Twitter and Google+ accounts along with their Facebook pages, while citizens were updating their blogs and honing their tweets.
While news from the north, cut off and deprived of electricity, comes through sparingly, in the South, the internet allows mobilisation.
Parabolic Dish in Mali via @Mbokoniko on twitter
The 'Collectif des Ressortissants du Nord' (The Northern Citizens' Collective) or COREN has 303 members of its Facebook group at the time of writing.
For the last few weeks, COREN have mobilised the people of Mali throughout the entire territory, with the page notably being used to announce upcoming events as well as to demonstrate solidarity as shown in the following status update from group member Oumar Maigar:
Renegade soldiers have announced that they are seizing power in Mali, after taking over the state television building and presidential palace.
They say President Amadou Toumani Touré's government failed to adequately support their troops in an increasingly violent struggle with Tuareg rebels in the north of the country who threaten to seek secession from Mali.
Many citizens are perplexed as to why a coup is being staged so soon ahead of already scheduled elections on April 29, 2012, and there are many theories.

A spokesman of the committee, Lieutenant Kanoré stated that although they have dissolved the current institutions, they have no intention of holding on to power.
Fights between soldiers who support the coup and others that remain loyal to President Touré are still ongoing.
Some politicians and high-ranking officers have reportedly been arrested in Bamako, the capital city.
Malians citizens are a bit stunned by the turn of events.
Here are some reactions after learning of the power grab by the armed mutiny :
@ibiriti: democracy is not just about regular elections replacing one incompetent lot with another. it has to deliver goods
@philinthe_: Banks + petrol stations closed in #Bamako #Mali.
Talking to taxi drivers who are asking double their normal price.
Sotrama still 100-150CFA
@temite: Whatever happens, the loser will inevitably be that unity, fraternal bond between peoples & cultures #Mali
Conspiracy theories abound as to why a coup is being staged only few weeks before the scheduled elections :
The Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity lead by former poet Javier Sicilia celebrated its first birthday on March 28, 2012; in other words, it's been a year since the assassination of his son Juan Francisco Sicilia whose body was found along with other victims of the violence in Mexico in the community of Las Brisas in Temixco, Morelos.
National newspapers like Milenio reported the activities that took place in remembrance of the anniversary:
The MPJD began with a letter from the poet Javier Sicilia, when he lost his 24-year-old son, Jaunelo, as a result of the violence of the war.
With the cry of "Estamos hasta la madre!"
("We're fed up!"), thousands of Mexican citizens overcame their fear and poured into the streets in protest of the war.
One year ago, the movement that was born in Morelos inspired thousands of Mexicans to denounce the effects of the war and to bring to life the stories of the victims.
As part of this anniversary, the blog Mexicans in Switzerland for Peace spread the following letter of support:
"A million men march to demand the fall of Ganzouri's cabinet" read the official newspaper of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP, affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood) after events that have left the Egyptian population baffled.
"How did it all start?" was the question being asked by everyone.
How did the close relationship between Egypt's military council (SCAF) and the nearly controlling political majority lead to a "bad breakup"?
The series of accusations erupted when the FJP issued a statement :
Reasons given by the Freedom and Justice Party for opposing the current government. Reasons behind our refusal of Ganzouri's government
- Keeping the government will raise suspicions about the fairness of the elections and the referendum on the constitution
- Does SCAF want to thwart the revolution, make the people despair, and rig the elections?
- SCAF has threatened to dissolve parliament by appealing against the Head of the Supreme Constitutional Court.
- SCAF's insistence on keeping a failing government in power means they want to thwart the revolution, make the people despair, and rig the elections
SCAF's response was as provocative as the Muslim Brotherhood's statements, bringing to mind the events of 1954 when the Muslim Brotherhood were blamed, banned, thrown into prisons, and tortured by the authorities.
SCAF has stated that accusations of rigging the elections were a slander.
They also used a threatening tone when they asked "certain political forces" to learn the lessons of the past.
The public was left wondering what will happen in this game of rivalry between the people in power and the people yet to be handed power.
Will they clash or was it just one of the acts in the political play Egypt is enacting nowadays?
Simultaneously, the Muslim Brotherhood tried to step up their game, and announced that Khairat Al Shater, former deputy supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood and businessman tycoon, is their choice in Egypt's alternating Presidency act.
The decision was shocking, even for members of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Freedom and Justice Party.
Many people viewed it as the wrong one, with some claiming it to be a sign of "the beginning of the end".
Others referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as the new NDP, where authority and money become a dominating factor for control.
Social media users have been on a mission to act as analysts and give their opinions and views regarding the bizarre choice:
Khaled El Baramawy compared Shater to Aboul Fotouh (a leading Brotherhood figure who was expelled after announcing his intention to run for president) and sarcastically tweeted: @weskandar: If Al-Shater is the consensus candidate then the #SCAF is the #Ikhwan.
Ahmed Aggour tweeted: @Psypherize: The oppressed have become the oppressors. #Ikhwan
Hassan El Shater, one of Khairat El Shater's 10 children, was not the happiest with his dad's nomination when he tweeted:
@Hassan_elShater : Unfortunately dad is running for presidency! :s
No one really knows what the conclusion of the political play in Egypt will be, but one thing is certain, Egyptians are witnessing an exciting period and they alone will determine their history.
Nigeria’s cyberspace was aflame recently due of the launching of Dominion Air.
Why would the advent of another brand name into the aviation space generate so much public discourse?
It happens that this is no usual airline: it is alleged to be owned by an Evangelical “prosperity” minister, Bishop David Oyedepo:
A Nigerian Christian author, Preacher, founder and Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church World Wide also known as Winners Chapel and its affiliated International churches known as Winners Chapel International, with headquarters in Ogun State, Nigeria.
He is also the senior pastor of Faith Tabernacle, a 50,000 seat church auditorium reputed to be the largest church auditorium in the world by the Guinness Book of Records.The Winners Chapel network of churches is present in over 300 cities in all states of Nigeria, as well as in over 63 cities in 32 African Nations, Dubai, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
Bishop David Oyedepo (Courtsey: yemojanews.com)
Forbes ranks Oyedepo as Nigeria's richest pastor:
Estimated net worth: $150 million.
David Oyedepo is Nigeria’s wealthiest preacher...
Oyedepo owns four private jets and homes in London and the United States.
He also owns Dominion Publishing House, a thriving publishing company that publishes all his books (which are often centred on prosperity).
He founded and owns Covenant University, one of Nigeria’s leading tertiary institutions, and Faith Academy, an elite high school.
Sahara Reporters claims that the floating of Dominion Air was due to the escalating cost of maintaining Oyedepo’s private jets:
The rising cost of maintaining four private jets has forced flamboyant Nigerian pastor, Bishop David Oyedepo, to set up a commercial airline that uses four airplanes that had hitherto served as part of his private fleet.
Last year, as staff costs, fuel prices and landing fees escalated, Bishop Oyedepo had contemplated selling two of the jets.
But when no buyers were forthcoming, he turned to Plan B: to set up Dominion Air and put the jets to commercial use.
The reactions on many Nigerian social platforms were varied.
Here are some sarcastic and critical twits:
@dangeldiva: So is the pilot going to pray before take-off? #DominionAir
‏ @nzesylva: As soon as the pilot puts off the 'fasten your seat belt' sign, all passengers are to close their eyes for praise n worship. #DominionAir
@FedUpNigerian: #DominionAirInflightEntertainment It’s not allowed to clap after landing, we can only shout hallelujah! #dominionair
@Ms_Mustapha: In flight magazines to be replaced with bibles #dominionair
@sheikhofeffizy: #dominionair...no fones or BB on board and carries only saints...
@kj_hova: Religion must not b taxd by govt.
Howeva, its profit making ventures must b subject to company & income taxes etc. #DominionAir
@BuzorIbusaBoy: U complained about his jet, he got an airline, doesn't that tell u that he doesn't care....U still want to complain? #DominionAir
@ChikaUwazie: Now I see why Nigerians kill themselves to become a pastor #dominionair
Twitter users in support:
@OgbeniBen: For those criticising #DominionAir "(my) ♏v̶̲̥̅ People perish bcos they lack wisdom" its a̶̲̥̅ Go̲̣̥o̲̣̥d Move for we at Winners Family.
@drphilip2010: I hear the sound of #envy! #DominionAir #BishopOyedepo. @lutoluh: If Oyedepo had kept his money in the bank or built a mansion in his village with it...none would be ranting right now! #dominionAir
Kathleen Ndongmo identifies “7 Things to Consider before Criticising Bishop Oyedepo”:
7- A “full time” pastor is not allowed to do business?
He commits a ‘crime’ if he does?
A full time politician can loot and that’s no crime?
6- Pick one: The man who loots ur treasury for his business or the man who uses ur voluntary donations for a business.
Are we sentimental?
5- Tax the ‘church’ if government deems it fit.
That’s an okay dynamic. For all you know, the ‘church’ will pay.
Comfortably.
4- I grew up in the Catholic Church.
Where ‘mission’ schools, ‘mission’ hospitals etc where a benefit to the community.
3- How can a man’s only crime for starting a business be the fact that he heads a Christian ministry?
2- If an atheist starts a business that works will there be uproar?
Does faith nullify? 1.
Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (allegedly) starts First Nation, no negative uproar.
Why is there one when Oyedepo starts Dominion?
Phantom of Jargon points out flaws in Ndongmo’s thesis:
7
A politician looting IS a crime, Christianity is not a business venture, Dominion AIRLINE is something MASSIVE!
If Bishop Oyedepo wants to go Donald Trump, he should drop ministry.
6
You’re actually making this sound worse for Bishop Oyedepo: “..uses ur voluntary donations for a business” If he reps Christianity truly, I know for a fact these ‘voluntary donations’ are not bargaining chips for entrepreneurship, its meant for helps and evangelism
5. ano… Kathleen Ndongmo-san there is a reason why Churches are not taxed in the first place, it clearly isn’t meant to exist as a profit driven organization and CHIGAU!
There are churches that cannot pay… comfortably.
4
Thumbs up to the true Catholics but those are ‘mission amenities’ a Dominion Airline is a commercial establishment, I find it difficult to see how it would directly affect those who really need ‘help’ in a community, Its just like someone opening a casino and going like “I’m trying to help people become rich ”
Bishop Oyedepo has not commented about the ownership of Dominion Air.
As such, Contra Culture E-Magazine thinks that the entire furore over Dominion Air is unnecessary:
So there is a rumour on the web that Bishop Oyedepo is in the process of starting an airline company called Dominion airlines.
It is a rumour because nobody from Winners chapel has provided any response...
While the outside world appears unanimous in its praise for outgoing Senegalese president Abdoulaye Wade and democracy after a peaceful election outcome in March 2012, the Senegalese blogosphere has been more critical of former President Wade's record.
Bloggers have not forgotten the victims of pre-electoral violence, the violation of press freedoms, and multiple examples of poor governance throughout Wade's presidency from 2000-2012.

Tanzania bid farewell to one of its most popular film stars, Steven Kanumba, with an emotionally-charged funeral on 11 April, 2012.
He died early on Saturday morning, aged 28, after an altercation with his girlfriend Elizabeth ‘Lulu’ Michael.
That more than 30,000 people including Tanzania’s Vice President Mohamed Gharib Bilal, Tanzania’s First Lady Mama Salma Kikwete, other senior government officials, artists and people from all walks of life gathered to pay their last respects at the capital Dar Es Salaam's Leader’s Club, is a testimony to Kanumba's immense popularity at such an early age and to his contribution to Tanzania’s film industry (popularly known as Bongo Movies).
More than 30,000 people gathered to pay their last respects.

Some mourners took photos and tweeted live as people grieved, fainted and demanded to carry the coffin of the much-loved iconic actor to the cemetery.
@BongoCelebrity tweeted :
It’s so painful to lose you our Hero and the only existed Steven Kanumba 'the great'.
Am sending my condolence to your lovely mom, your young bro, your family members, our bongo movie friends and the entire TZ community.
Its not good to judge anyone on this issue, only God can judge a person, Imagine if you are the one judged by everyone as what is happening to lulu now!!
I am very sure that Lulu was not intending to do any bad thing to Kanumba, and am also sure that Lulu was not involved in this matter in any way, may be there was something else concerning Kanumba's health, but let us wait for the Doctors and Lawyers to play their part.
R.I.P our beloved Kanumba.
It’s a high time for our guys like Vincent Kigosi and others to go on with this good thing Kanumba started; we still have good actors and actresses who can take us to the next level.
I really believe in you Ray.
Wavuti has a curated commentary from social media including Kanumba’s last tweets as well as tweets by his fans after his death.
On April 8 Anonymous Tunisia (which claims affiliation with the hacking group Anonymous) hacked the emails of the Tunisian prime minister Hamadi Jebali.
The movement dubbed it "Operation Touche pas à ma Tunise" ("Get Your Hands Off My Tunisia") which is part of the broader "Operation Tunisia Back".

On the eve of the revolution in 2011 Anonymous members worldwide targeted several governmental websites in what was known as Operation Tunisia.
Anonymous also recently launched online attacks against Tunisian Islamists.
Now it has published 2,725 emails of Tunisia's ruling Ennahda party online, including emails of the prime minister. Phone numbers belonging to key government officials have since been circulating on Facebook pages.
The government was caught by surprise and so far has not reacted.
Meanwhile, netizens have been divided over the efficacy of the move.
Bassem Meddeb tweeted enthusiastically about the search through thousands of emails:
This post is part of our special coverage Kony 2012.
A social media campaign to raise support for the arrest of Ugandan guerrilla leader and wanted war criminal Joseph Kony has taken a new twist.
In a blog post titled "#Kony2012 is a Parody," Sean Jacobs looks at online parody videos about the viral campaign.
YES WE KONY.
It's March, and the Internet delivers 2012's first globe-consuming meme: the unstoppable, Stop-Kony 2012 video, which has highlighted the plight of African child soldiering like never before.
But is it really good?
Is it really bad?
Or is the world really more complex than 'good guys' and 'bad guys'?
Whatevers; one thing's for sure, this is momentous: never had a 27-minute video devoid of both cats and boobs ever achieved such virality.
Is this a demonstration of the internet's ability to instantly inform and engage tens of millions; and a hopeful sign that there is a willingness among those millions, to engage passionately with something more meaningful?
Or does Kony2012 just mark the dawn of a rapacious new era of viral humanitarian marketing?

On April 2, 2012, the Ukrainian TV channel TVi aired Kostiantyn Usov's documentary about living conditions and treatment of inmates at Kyiv's Lukyanivska prison (known in Ukrainian as Lukyanivsky SIZO, or remand prison), as well as widespread corruption among the facility's staff.
Many of those who have already watched Usov's documentary were shocked by what they saw, to say the least.
LEvko of the English-language Foreign Notes blog wrote this in a post entitled, "The hell-hole that is Lukyaniv prison":
The brave investigative journalist Konstyantyn Usov from TVi recently managed to smuggle several mobile phones into the notorious Lukyaniv investigative isolation unit where was detained, and where is still being held.
His nightmarish television documentary can be seen here....
The conditions in some of the cells are unimaginably bad...diabolical...don't watch it before going to bed...
Remember, the inmates shown have not been tried or sentenced - many may be innocent but may nevertheless be detained there for years....
It is difficult to accept that human beings can be so maltreated in a state institution in the capital city of a European democracy in the 21st century.. utterly and absolutely shameful.
Lukyanivska prison gained some international exposure last year, when ex-PM Yulia Tymoshenko was placed there during her trial.
The Guardian's Miriam Elder described the detention facility on October 16, 2011:
Tymoshenko remains inside Lukyanivska, which functions mainly as a pre-trial detention centre.
She shares a 15 sq m space with two other women, both awaiting charges on economic crimes.
There is a small window, covered with three sets of bars.
There is no hot water and the thick walls of the 19th-century prison keep its interior cold and damp.
Tymoshenko spends her days reading.
In December 2011, a leaked video showing Tymoshenko at the medical wing of Lukyanivska prison was aired on TV and shared on social networks in Ukraine. Reuters reported on December 15:
The video clip was one of two aired on TV with the apparent aim of showing Tymoshenko was being well treated and living in conditions akin to those of a good hotel.
In the video, prison guards are actively helping the cameraman to shoot the film, even holding back a keyhole cover into the room for him.
The 51-year-old Tymoshenko, who was mostly covered by bed-clothes, was clearly unhappy at being filmed, though her words were not audible.
In another part of the footage, which showed a well-furnished room with a refrigerator, Tymoshenko can be heard saying: "I was being kept before in unacceptable conditions and I don't want you to show this false picture now."
In his documentary, Kostiantyn Usov shows the Lukyanivska prison the way it really is, as a place where thousands of Ukrainians with no access to domestic or international media spend years living in overcrowded, subhuman conditions as they await their verdicts.
He wrote this about the making of the film on his blog at Ukrainska Pravda:
Lukyanivsky SIZO.
A place where people are kept as animals.
Lukyanivska prison is a facility of preliminary detention.
To be staying in its dark cells isn't a punishment, but a preventive measure.
That is, any suspect can be locked up here, and in contemporary Ukraine it absolutely does not mean that one has to be a real criminal.
occupies the first place in the number of reports of cruelty, torture, inhuman living conditions and mysterious deaths in prison cells, and this is where the regime of has been its enemies - and this is why we have made it our goal to find a way to show people the real Lukyanivka.
The real one, and not what they show to the select media.
We created our own network of agents inside the prison, in order to have our own people in every building, on every floor of the SIZO in a minimal period of time.
From the , we mobile phones equipped with video cameras to each of our agents, and the inmates were sending us glimpses into their lives, little by little, 10 to 15 seconds at a time, for six months.
I can imagine what it took Usov and his team , his work will never be in vain, he is a brave person, if only there were more people like him.
Many are concerned for the journalist's safety.
On Facebook, Roman Plechun wrote :
Kostiantyn, aren't you afraid that "the regime" will come after you?
I'd just like to understand how you found courage for this!?
YouTube user BenderZT wrote this about the main implication of the film:
A good phrase as conclusion, that is a micro-model of the country.
Very sad to realize this...
Facebook user Yevgeny Titorchuk wrote :
Hard to watch it and see all the horror and meaninglessness of the system that is indifferent to the human being.
And the most terrible thing is that this system has been created by human beings and is being maintained by human beings too.
On Usov's Ukrainska Pravda blog, Facebook user Lyubomyr Drozdovskyy offered this explanation for the shocking cruelty of life at Lukyanivska shown in the film:
Actually, financial gain isn't the only reason for such horrible conditions at the SIZO.
The other goal of the SIZO is to create conditions so unbearable that a person would be basically begging to be transferred to , where the conditions are somewhat better after all.
Say, there is someone whose case lacks any evidence needed to prove guilt, but .
So they put this person into the SIZO, and after a few months of what in fact is torture, is ready to testify against , submit a self-incriminating statement, admit guilt completely - just to have a chance to get out of the SIZO, even if it means getting out to .
In another comment on Usov's Ukrainska Pravda blog, user skilachi wrote this :
Almost everything is the way it was eight years ago.
I still remember each of the 254 days .
Upon my release I wished for this: that every future employee of the , prosecutor's office, court or any other entity that locks people up, had an "internship" for at least a few months at this facility prior to .
Maybe then they'd view the use of preventive measures towards suspects and the accused differently.
But this is just .
To those who have been through this hell, my best wishes of health.
To those who fail to avoid this, remember to always remain human beings.
There seems to have been no reaction from the authorities to Usov's film yet.
The State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine, however, issued a statement through its press service on April 2, which reads like a "preemptive strike" type of message to journalists like Usov:
Kyiv SIZO - the most interesting facility for the mass media
Recently, there have been more and more information, commentaries and random stories appearing in the mass media about the work of the facilities.
The majority of these stories comment on the conditions in which the arrested and convicted persons are being kept, as well as on the actions by the penitentiary facilities' staff.
The analysis of the publications and shows lack of competence and objectivity, and sometimes outright unhidden bias of the journalists .
Due to this, systematically refute the published information or provide additional commentary on it.
As for Lukyanivska prison's most recent international exposure, LEvko of Foreign Notes links to this Kyiv Post item on the April 3 meeting of Freedom House representatives with one of the SIZO's highest-ranking current inmates, ex-minister of internal affairs Yuri Lutsenko.
LEvko writes:
The Freedom House guys who visited Yuriy Lutsenko at the prison on Tuesday should check out video....After their visit: "The State Penitentiary Service stressed that the visitors noted that Ukraine took measures to bring conditions for detention and medical treatment for detainees in line with international standards."
You f***ing liars...
Zambia’s President Michael Sata has invited the ire of citizens living abroad for ridiculing them during a three day visit to neighbouring Botswana and also dashing their hopes for inclusion of dual citizenship, an issue discussed on many a forum, in the new republican constitution currently being written.
President Sata, known for his brashness and disregard for protocol, was reported by the citizen online news site, the Zambian Watchdog, to have had a question and answer session with Zambians residing in Botswana where he allegedly told them that former President Rupiah Banda whom he defeated in the 2011 elections wanted to include dual citizenship in the failed constitution because he was from Gwanda in Zimbabwe.
President Sata, before and after he took office.
Photo source: Zambian People
Part of the question and session went like this:
Questions- whats the status of the Dual citizenship?
Sata: Which town are you from?
Monze ?
Do you want to belong to Monze and Namwala ?
Because RB was from Gwanda in Zimbabwe that’s why he wanted Dual citizenship
Question: it is difficult for us living in Diaspora to get land back home, what is the Govt doing about it?
Sata: What are you doing in Botswana?
Answer: I am a teacher!
Sata: Go back to Zambia and teach your relatives then you will get Land
Question: Mr President, you never consulted on the Ithezhi tezhi and Chirundu districts
Sata: Whom did you consult to come to Botswana?
Concluding remarks- President Sata All of you who are here with fake questions am very disappointed with you and embarrassed, are you not even ashamed of yourselves?
You ran away from Zambia and thought we couldn’t find you and now today we have caught you.
You are refugees in Botswana being exploited by the Botswana Govt.
You left Zambia to come and work here for an extra K1?
On teachers and doctors working in Botswana where many flocked to from the late 1980 to the early 2000s, President Sata said:
You are busy educating Tswanas leaving your own relatives in Zambia uneducated and you are proud?
All of you were educated by your parents who never even finished standard 7 and struggled to educate you and you run away from them?
Doctors
Your relatives are dying in Zambia you are busy saving tswana lives?
Accountants Botswana has only 5 shops and you call your self an accountant when Diamond mines want a consultant they will call a South African and not a Zambian, what are you still doing here?
President Sata’s responses and earlier statement at another function during his Botswana visit, contrasted that of his foreign minister Given Lubinda who had told the Botswana-based Zambians that the PF government policy was that Zambians in the Diaspora did not have to relocate back to Zambia.
Reacting to Sata's comments, John, a Zambian Watchdog reader, said:
The President’s speech was very personal, emotional and uneducated.
It is a pity for Africa because power is increasingly being handed to the biggest noise makers through the ballot; rather than leaders with clear policies on how to govern and develop their countries.
What is H.E’s level of education?
It is no longer plausible that educated people (or even uneducated ones) should live in their countries of birth.
That is so 1970s when Africa continously moaned about “brain drain”.
Is the Zambian president aware of something called “diaspora remittances” or “brain gain”?
Is he aware that remittances from the Diaspora are currently being harnessed to build roads, airports, and technological cities in Nigeria, Kenya and recently the Republic of Southern Sudan?
Nkoya Nationalist, one of the few, agreed with President Sata:
The President elect is right, Zambia has a small population of which out of that only a small percentage are professionals in various fields and disciplines.
Of those professionals, almost 3/4 are out of the country working for other nations.
Who then is going to develop the country if our professionals are all abroad working for other nations?
Why should anyone complain about substandard ministers and government officials when you professionals are not available to be considered for those same roles and positions?
Do you know that Zambia would probably be one of the best countries in the world if only our professionals would be more patriotic by coming back home to contribute towards the development of the country?
An anguished Peace Maker wrote:
Those doubting this story should think twice.
You mean you dont know our President?
Our President needs 24/7 monitoring because he will keep on embarrasing us.
HE needs serious guidance in everything.
His energy should be guided to something productive and as much as possible try not to expose him to such situations and if so do it off camera for goodness sake. So far, I think prevention is better than cure!
We are already in a mess and nothing to defend but to help him!
Ultimately it is not only him to experience the shame but every Zambian regardless of the Party one belongs to.
We have a task at hand!!
This remains a thorn in my fresh, borrowing St Paul’s experience.
There is little we can do but nurse this issue up to 2016 when, with due respect, we must plan for a smooth exit strategy for him.
We cant continue like this thereafter.Its agony and terrible nightmare!
On the Facebook group, 90 days (Government thumbs up/down every 90 days, Maria Kapambwe Kasolo, gave the reason why Zambians left the country en masse:
You know why professionals left for Botswana - better salary!
I know of a number of them who have done well for themselves n families.
Had they stayed in zed they would not have achieved anything.
GRZ should improve condtions of service n pipo will not go searching for greener pastures.
Some of u r saying mCS was right in answering the way he did - I am saying the president needs to use diplomacy regardless - he should ask why they left n not castigate them - aint right at all!
Responding to Maria Kapambwe Kasolo’s post, Arnold Chinyemba wrote:
He is thinking every Zambian is a ngwangwazi (tout).
Hence to him allowing street vendors is empowering Zambians.
GOD HELP THIS COUNTRY.

Kenyan Poet celebrates the day with a poem:
It all started as a vision of one man,
A the dream of one son,
A son of Ghana, a Nkrumah who sang a song
whose words were written with the blood of our brothers sailed off
to plantations as slaves to white masters.
A song whose rhythm and tune was hummed
by the cries of our people
Feet shuffling, hands trembling, mouths begging
We don’t know them!
We don’t know the freedom fighters
The rhythm of whips cracking on their backs
The sound of gunshots reigning in the dull yet sunny days,
Dark, yet moonlit nights.
The sounds had become a dirge to their ears

The eviction of Zambia’s representative, musician popularly known as Mampi, from the on-going Big Brother Africa seventh series, has been received with mixed feelings from netizens.
Big Brother Africa: StarGame is the seventh series of the Big Brother Africa reality television series which will air for 91 days and the winner will walk home with $300,000.
Produced by Endemol in South Africa, the show has become the most popular reality TV show in Africa.
Mampi, real name Mirriam Mukape, lasted three weeks in the house before she was nominated for eviction by other housemates.
When Zambian Watchdog broke the news of Mampi’s eviction, most of the readers did not hesitate to condemn the musician.
A TV screen shot of Mampi in the BBA House.
One reader, Gloria, did not mince her words, comparing to another Zambian contestant who won the inaugural BBA series, Cherise Makubale:
Another reader, Violet wrote:
Yippee im so glad shes gone, she’s a hater and a gossiper. i wonder if she was aware of that…..Jooo Mampi we wont miss uuuo….Now Maneta must follow her shes one irritating little bee BZZZZZZZ….looks its not all that….
Manner and dignity they both dont have…..Byeeee
Said Ras-Kadafi of Mampi’s eviction:
Is it so surprising, honestly? u pipo u dnt get it, jst like most of us, Mampi ni mwana wamukomboni , u can’t tel me u had hope 4 Mampi, in fact 2-3 weeks was jst too much 4 Mampi, she is used to showing her private parts in public and yet u expert the most such a one, i mean they are pipo who know the difference between acting and real life, but not Mampi, She’s part time AN musician and part time A public stripper, Thanks God we did not see more before she could come back home. ”
One reader, Ndumeleti, came to her aid:
Congrats to Mampi (mwanenu) for increasing your 'relational capital'.
Being on the BB show is like going to university in the academic world.
Before, only the 13million people of Zambia knew you but now the whole of Africa does.
Its not the degree or the relational capital a person has that makes them big, its what they do or plan to to with it that separates the boys from men, women from girls.
Life will never be the same for u again just by exposing yourself to Africa in the past few weeks so what you do with that capital is all up to u.
Lastly, i personally would do all i can to convince hubby and our sponsors to have u play the lead role in our upcoming project.
We are spending so much to bring in the Nigerian actors becoz we didnt have a Zambian star who was known to the whole continent.
Now we have u and we can sell a product to other countries with u in it coz your 'relational capital' has grown....
So people that rejoice when a person does not go as far in a competition of this magnitude only do so becoz they are limited in their thinking and have no idea just how many ways a person can gain a lot more from such an experience- so chimbwi ni ndani ?....
Im ever so proud of u mwanenu- u r made of steel.
Another netizen, Isaac Mwanza, also on Facebook, added a political dimension of Zambian women not supporting a fellow woman:
Mampi Mukape rejected by her own people and Zambian women were in forefront of decampaigning her.
I think its an illusion to support women in Zambia when they cant support each other.
Let us all rally behind Roki of Zim or Prezzo of Kenya for BBA prize!
On another citizen media news website, Tumfweko, snr pastor wrote:
So please, my fellow zedians lets emulate other countries and do the rest for our surviving BBA stargame inmates.
I equally aware that Zedian housemates are currently feared because of their potential.
May God Bless Zed!!
Equally on Twitter, netizens expressed varied views:
Another tweep, still hopeful about another Zambia BBA participant, tweeted:
@DJLBCZambia: Now that mampi is out, my interest in BBA has dwindled, but wait, we still have Paul Ngozi's daughters in the game.
It goes without saying that most people want to get their information from more sources than just the TV news or major newspapers. In Latin America, Europe, Asia – all over the world, in fact – this has been the case since the Millennium: the best news, opinions grounded in fact and the most pertinent commentary are to be found on blogs and social networks, and in newspapers published by universities and activist networks.
Revista Ocas is one such publication, containing information that sets it apart from the mainstream press in Brazil.
Indeed, it goes even further than that.
An acronym for Organização Civil de Ação Social (Organisation for Civil Action), the publication is a voluntary project inspired by street papers from around the world, particularly The Big Issue, which has been distributed in London since the 1990s.
The founders of Revista Ocas followed this example in Brazil by creating work opportunities for people who are at social risk.
Moreover, having grasped the potential for such volunteers in the country, the International Network Street Pappers (INSP) supported the idea of creating a magazine to be distributed by homeless people.
You read that right – homeless people.
Revista Ocas has been handed out on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro since 2002.
Revista Ocas issue 61: the subheading reads 'Invest in a human being'.

The magazine’s editorial team explains :
The Global Development blog of The Guardian's (UK) continues its coverage of land deals after the release of the largest public database on international land deals in April.
One of the countries covered in the report is Ethiopia where villagers in Gambella province are forced to settle in state-designated villages to pave the way for land grabbers.
Gambella is the poorest region in Ethiopia.
The Reporter, a local biweekly English newspaper, reports that the Ethiopian government has started evaluating the performance of investors who acquired large tracts of land to undertake commercial farm projects.
Though this can be taken as an important milestone for anti-land grabbing activists, Ethiopia’s government decision to evaluate the performance of investors who acquired land has received a scant attention from international mainstream media.
Extracts from Fred Pearce's new book, The Land Grabbers: Africa's hidden revolution, show that land grabbing has more impact on the world's poor than climate change.
In an interview, Fred Pearce notes that poor people were being moved off the land with little regard for their historical and cultural rights.
Target countries of land deals from the Land Matrix Project
However, an Ethiopian government official counters this argument:
He downplayed criticisms that the land leasing has ‘brought negative impacts on the communities who live close to the farms’, claiming that ‘due emphasis has been given to make these investments free of adverse effect on the society who dwell close to them and this would continue in strengthened manner’.
Land activists have created an online petition and are campaigning using Facebook and Twitter.
A petition targeting top USA and UK diplomats reads:
I am extremely concerned about reports of deliberate, persistent, and serious abuses of the rights of Indigenous Peoples in southwestern Ethiopia.
The government’s program of “villagization” is forcibly removing at least 200,000 Indigenous people from their ancestral lands in the Gambella region and relocating them in new state-built villages.
Although the government promises them better access to jobs, education, and health care in these villages, Human Rights Watch researchers found little or no evidence of these services.
On the contrary, displaced people fear starvation since they no longer have access to their farms, forests, and rivers.
Those who raise their voices against these abuses are frequently jailed, tortured, raped, and otherwise intimidated by government security forces.
Those who try to return to their ancestral lands find that the government has already leased their lands to foreign investors who are hurriedly bulldozing forests, farms, and wetlands in order to grow commercial crops of agro fuels, tea, spices, rice, and sugar cane, mostly for export.
The resulting environmental devastation and degradation will further undermine food security for Indigenous Peoples.
A Facebook group called Stop Land Grabbing in Gambella, Ethiopia reads:
A space for the international community to voice its concerns over the human rights abuses and environmental destruction the land grabbing happening in the Gambella region of Ethiopia is causing
Land grabbing is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions; the buying or leasing of large pieces of land in developing countries by domestic and transnational companies, governments, and individuals
A new Indian TV talk show titled Satyamev Jayate (Truth Alone Prevails) premiered on May 6, 2012 and took the nation by surprise.
Its anchor Bollywood actor and filmmaker Aamir Khan is bringing out on the table taboo and sensational social issues which are engaging more and more Indians.
Millions of vieweres across South Asia are glued to their TV sets every Sunday as the show is being aired in various channels of private along with public networks simultenously.
Amreekan Desi watched its first episode on "female foeticide" and here is the reaction:
Our daily lives allow us the option of closing our eyes and pretending there is no problem. This show brings it right inside our living rooms, with full facts and figures.
We can no longer pretend that this is somebody else’s problem.
It is OUR problem.
The Life and Times of an Indian Homemaker shares an email from a courageous survivor of child sexual abuse who watched the second episode on the same subject:
Satyamev Jayate touched a deep wound.
Listening to the survivor stories a memory came haunting from the past.
A dark secret buried deep inside, something that must have down the line changed my whole personality and what I am now.
Talking to my son I realized that however open a household environment is there are certain things that stunt the growth and health of a child.
Child abuse doesn’t occur only in houses which are chained by so called social “norms, values” etc it happens wherever there is a child who is vulnerable.
Abusers target children who can be soft targets, knowing everything about their background and psyche, winning their trust and providing that comfort zone which sometimes a child lacks.
I am a survivor.
After almost 30 years I broke the silence.
There are more reactions in the blogosphere.
Half a cup of tea shares a story of maltreatment in a hospital, inspired by Aamir's show on "Corruption in the Indian healthCare system"; Ugich Konitari shares that her maid could associate her daughters story with a case on the Satyamev Jayate episode on "Dowry".
Mahesh Murthy wished if Satyamev Jayate was a social movement backed by TV.
There are many discussions in the Twittersphere on this show:
priyasaha1: watched my first episode of satyamev jayate yesterday, it was simply fantastical. now i know why people r loving it.

The show is not without controversy.
After an episode on malpractices by doctors the Indian Medial Association claimed that he defamed the doctors and demanded apology but Aamir defended his actions saying he won't apologize. It has also been alleged that Aamir Khan receives a high remuneration of Rs.
3 crore (USD 600,000) per episode is this high budget production.
However Astitwa defends Satyamev Jayate and provides a reply to those critique Aamir Khan:
Even if 1% of this 121 crore strong nation is able to change its attitude, I think Aamir Khan’s endless gyaanbazi (edification) and the so-called irritating marketing gimmicks will be palatable to us.
What say, India?
Debolina Raja Gupta posts a list of the topics featured in Satyamev Jayate till 10 June, 2012:
1
Episode 1 - Female Foeticide
Episode 2 - Child Sexual Abuse
3
Episode 3 - Dowry
4
Episode 4 - Corruption In The Indian HealthCare System
5. Episode 5 - Honour Killing
6. Episode 6 - Problems Faced By The Disabled In Our Country
She thinks that the show deserves applause, not criticism:
I really appreciate the idea that finally, Indian television audience is glued on to something else other than the mindless saas-bahu (mother-in-law vs. daughter-in-law) serials, or television serials in general, that are such a shitload of crap.
Indi.ca from Sri Lanka praises the show: With many social problems, the shame is on the victim and they are brought into the conspiracy through silence. But breaking that silence can have a knock-on effect, and it’s great that this Khan is using his celebrity for such a worth cause.
It’s also very compelling, immediate television.
Debolina concludes:
Aamir has managed to create a stir and shake us all up, but how much that really affects us and how much we actually do about it remains to be seen.
An explosion struck one of Nairobi's major roads, Moi Avenue, in Kenya's capital Monday afternoon.
Initial investigations suggest that the blast resulted from electric fault in the area.
Kenya's Police Commissioner has refuted rumors of bomb attacks linked to Al-Shabaab.
Kenya has been hit with a series of bomb and grenade attacks in Kenya since the country's military incursion into Somalia against Al Shabaab dubbed “Operation Linda Nchi” (Swahili for “Operation Defend the Country”).
On Twitter, netizens use the hashtaga #NairobiBlast and #MoiAvenueBlast to discuss the tragedy and share information.

Government irresponsibility:
@tonybkaranja: We really need a disaster management plan that's not just on paper #nairobiblast

@TeamKonshens1: Just shows how incompetent our Emergency response teams are!!
Looks like a movie on live TV! #NairobiBlast
@iCabway: #MoiAvenueBlast reminds us why fire hydrant installation MUST be enforced in this troubled age.
African cities are hopeless in that regard.
Looting amidst tragedy:
@iAMneshynsky: Looters doing what they know best on moi avenue #NairobiBlast
@rmunene: Kenyans "siphoning" shoes and clothes from the stalls at the scene of the blast. #nairobiBlast #KTNLiveStream
Police inefficiency:
@ArybaStacks: I don't know why police are still allowing people along the whole Moi Av. stretch... What if there is a second blast? #MoiAvenueBlast
@Mwanikih: Cops making a bad situation worse by forcefully trying to evacuate the crowds.
Now guys are shouting "Mlikua wapi?" #NairobiBlast
Kenyan police say 27 people who were injured in the blast were undergoing treatment.
Kenyan tweep @RobertAlai started a lively debate on 14 May, 2012 about the need for companies to pay interns. @RobertAlai wanted tweeps to ask companies, "#DoYouPayInterns?":
@RobertAlai: If you are an intern and you feel that you are being exploited, please email me on alai @ techmtaa.com.
Let's ask #DoYouPayInterns ?
Tweeps immediately took to their keyboards siding with interns:
@madonah12: #PayInterns Is the best Trend Ever I just love the idea that Interns should get Lunch Fare and Pocket money cc @RobertAlai Good work
A banner in support of interns.

@tyrus_: Aye how come all those KE companies on Twitter who tweet "Good morning and Good night" and sell new products cant respond to #PayInterns ?
@RobertAlai: "Interns" must be paid.
Stand up for your rights and you'll find that employers are capable of paying you #PayInterns
@TheMacharia: I wonder how many of those on #PayInterns have actually hired, not selected, but hired interns.
@mainneli: Interns should be paid. they do the same work and same stuff like anyone else in the office,stop exploitation #Payinterns
@tkb: @kainvestor @Worldbank inviting users to wiki is same as @Wikipedia who don't #payinterns Create a global public good with all content open!
@KenyaPolice: Kenya Police does not support the exploiation of Kenyan workers. #PayInterns
However, some tweeps sided with companies using interns without pay:
@Kkaaria: Interns, 5 years into your career, you will realize how little you actually knew when you started off. Be patient.. #payInterns @TerryanneChebet: My two cents to the #payinterns.
I say no.
An allowance for food and transport, however is alright.
@mainaalex: ati #payinterns for what?if they are that good, they should start their own companies. show value you get paid.
@Kamungah: @MediaMK Interns contribute, companies gain as interns get required skills.
Some employers use them as 'continuous' interviews.
Bloggers have also joined the debate.
Blogger Dennis Matara argued that labour laws stipulate that interns must be paid after working for three months:
You must wake up!
You have been in intern for more than three months?
Get alive.
Labour laws clearly state that the company that takes you in as an intern is required by law to absorb you as their full time employee, paid in their scale and entitle to leave days among other benefits.
If they cannot do that, then your internship should end at the end of your third month there.
It is true and evident that some interns ‘decide’ to stay longer in the hope of ‘acting good’ in order to secure themselves a job.
Yes, that is ok but if the company really needs you that much, then they must take you in.
Many employers know very well that majority of these interns are straight from college, they do not have money even for their transport to work but still misuse them to the fullest.
Nairobi Wire noted that companies in Kenya paying interns are the minority:
The companies that pay there interns are the minority and they pay peanuts.
Reading through some of the tweets, KCB, EABL, CIC, KPLC, KBC, Standard Group, NMG, RMS among many others have been listed as the most exploitative.
Equity bank has been attacked for using CSR as a reason to have cheap labour.
KBC is the worst of all since interns have to pay to intern there.
There have also been complains of interns been sexually exploited.
This is one of the most lively discussion I've seen on twitter in a long time.
Most of the time, people are always rumbling about Kenya Power. #PayInterns has generated so much interest that at its peak, around 150 tweets were being tweeted per minute. This is considering its only in Kenya.
Various corporates have also tweeted responding to allegations that they do not remunerate their interns.
KCB tweeted, "KCB Group does not obtain any money from interns. Interns are actually paid a monthly stipend that is above the industry average"
In Kenya, city dwellers are learning different techniques to grow food for consumption and sale even in reduced spaces.
For people with low or no income, urban gardening may be the key to food security.
These videos show how food can be grown in containers and using limited space and resources.
Other techniques which are useful for people growing food in limited spaces are shared by other people on YouTube from different parts of the world.
For example, this is a great way to use up discarded plastic water bottles to grow food on a vertical garden: Seedling image is by Chrisseee on Flickr, with a Creative Commons Attribution License.
I Paid a Bribe is an initiative of Kenyan anti-corruption activists fighting corruption in Kenya using the new technologies to crowdsource corruption experiences.
I Paid a Bribe, modeled after India's anti-corruption portal (IPAB), is a partnership between IPAB and Wamani Trust of Kenya to bring IPAB to East and Central Africa.
I Paid a Bribe is:
www.ipaidabribe.or.ke is Wamani Trust's unique initiative to tackle corruption by harnessing the collective energy of citizens.
You can report on the nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of actual corrupt acts on this website.
Your reports will, perhaps for the first time, provide a snapshot of bribes occurring across your city.
We will use them to argue for improving governance systems and procedures, tightening law enforcement and regulation and thereby reduce the scope for corruption in obtaining services from the government. We invite you to register any recent or old bribes you have paid.
Please tell us if you resisted a demand for a bribe, or did not have to pay a bribe, because of a new procedure or an honest official who helped you.
We do not ask for your name or phone details, so feel free to report on the formats provided.
The initiative launched the ‘I paid a Bribe Kenya’ integrated SMS system in May this year to allow over 25 million Kenyans with access to a mobile phone to report and share their bribe experiences on the site:
To share their bribe experience using I paid a Bribe Kenya's SMS short code, one needs to send an SMS to the number 2025 indicating County, Department, amount.
There are three ways Kenyans can share their bribe experiences on the site:
Kenyans can report their bribe experiences either using the web version of the site (ipaidabribe.or.ke), the mobile version (m.ipaidabribe.or.ke) or the 2025 SMS short code. SMS to 2025 will be charged at KES 5
How does sharing corruption experiences online contribute to the fight against corruption?
Collins Baswony explains:
Fact 2: ‘Petty’ Corruption mostly goes unreported in Kenya 9 out of 10 respondents surveyed in the East African Bribery Index 2011 said they did not report cases of corruption. YES 9 out of 10.
As long as cases of ‘petty corruption’ continue to go unreported, public officials will continue to misuse their offices for private gain.
Fact 3: Corruption impedes Kenya’s Socio -economic development
The combined cost of Kenya’s prominent corruption scandals: Goldenberg of the 90’s, Anglo-leasing, Maize and oil scandals of 2000’s and the dollar/Kenyan shilling scandal of 2011 to the Kenyan economy is no doubt significant.
Imagine if all this money was put into development of infrastructure, healthcare, education etc.
As Kenya trudges into the future with the vision 2030 as the blueprint for the country’s economic, Social and political development, Corruption remains one of the most significant challenges to that goal.
Vision 2030 will remain a mirage in the horizon if Kenyans don’t collectively talk about and engage in the fight against corruption.
An anonymous visitor on the site adds: Not talking about it only makes it worse and it becomes acceptable because no one is complaining.
As Kenyans we have the tendancy to just accept the status quo and not question why things cant be different, and they can.
In this new age that we live in, where technology and social media have become a way of life, information can gather and spread very rapidly putting issues in the spotlight.
The more we talk about it, the more attention it gathers and leaders and policy makers are forced to address the issue.
Please don't stop talking about corruption and the toll it is taking on our society and making it rot from within.
Another one notes:
Kenyan's suffer from serious memory lapse! we only discuss corruption when we are face with major scandal's, yet petty corruption probably "steals" 30% of our household income, depletes our resources and erodes our moral values.
It will be difficult if not impossible to meet our goals for Vision 2030 if dont say no to petty corruption.
Petty corruption affects the middle class and poor.
The initiative is on Facebook and Twitter.
Corruption among politicians and government officials in Kenya is widespread.
The Goldenberg scandal is the longest-running corruption scandal in Kenya in which the Kenyan government subsidized exports of gold. The Goldenberg scandal cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country's annual GDP.

The Korean Food and Drug Administration announced on May 7, 2012, that emergency contraceptives, known as morning-after pills, will become available for purchase over the counter.
However, it has made non-emergency oral contraceptives, which were over the counter in the past, prescription-only drugs.
An emergency contraceptive prescription will still be required for teenagers.
These sudden changes regarding drug regulations have sparked heated discussions online.
While there are still debates going on about the risks and effectiveness of emergency contraceptives among medical communities, many South Korean net users have expressed dissents on the reversal.
As quoted in a Hangyoreh news article, woman rights organizations and especially young unmarried women, have criticized the decision as making the sale of conventional contraceptives extra inconvenient.

Lesotho held peaceful parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The ruling Democratic Congress of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili won most votes but fell short of the required majority.
Lesotho opposition parties have formed a coalition in order to form government.
Why is Western mainstream media not telling you about Lesotho's peaceful election?
JohnsonJJ says you should not be surprised.
He explains how Western pundits decide what is newsworthy in Africa:
It’s unsurprising that this has garnered little attention.
In fact, the country receives very little international media attention except in the form of poverty porn that stresses how horrible, destitute and AIDS-ridden Lesotho is.
A voter in Lesotho supporting Prime Minister Phakalitha Mosisili.
Lesotho, he argues, is too insignificant to sell in the United States:
The media establishment knows us pretty well.
It knows that simplistic – sensationalized – stories sell in America.
We’re not so great with nuance.
This is why we were so sold on the idea, for example, that the Rwandan genocide was the result of “ancient ethnic hatreds” rather than geopolitical context.
It’s also how we learned that failed state Somalia failed mainly because of its hordes of angry terrorists obsessed with killing Americans.
And it’s how we came to learn that all African children have distended bellies and flies on their faces all day.
It’s also how we learned from (the ever-obtuse) Nicholas Kristof that most African women suffer from “female genital mutilation” and that FGM poses the greatest threat to women on the entire continent.
That’s never going to sell in the United States.
If our uncritical engagement with media is any indication, we’re not even particularly engaged with our own.
Zachary Rosen notes that even when Lesotho receives media coverage, the articles are usually about AIDS and poverty:
The little coverage it does garner often assumes readers are completely ignorant and takes great pains to emphasize dismal statistics about rates of HIV/AIDS and poverty. Overall, few articles have attempted to move beyond superficialities and actually delve into the complexities of the local political atmosphere and the implications of the election outcome.
Well, even South African media ignored Lesotho elections.
Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa.
@fanamokoena: It's embarrassing that SA media gives us daily updates on French elections but fail to do the same for sister country Lesotho.
Irresponsible
@BelindaaPheto: Saddening to see SA's media houses showing little or no interest on the Lesotho elections.
@simonallison: Strange but true: I was the only journalist from any SA print or online pub. covering Lesotho elections.
All other content from wires.
Crazy
@sheofnations: @simonallison Makes sense for Int'l content,but it's highly problematic that news about the continent is filtered through Int'l media houses
@simonallison: @sheofnations yep, almost everything we read about Africa in SA is handpicked by European and American editors for their audiences...
Lesotho is a landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa.
It is a constitutional monarchy.
The Prime Minister is head of government while the king has ceremonial function.
The name Lesotho translates roughly into the land of the people who speak Sesotho.
This post is part of our special coverage Global Development.
Considering the debate generated by healthcare reform in the United States and the gradual withdrawal of the French state from public-funded social action, one might think that social protection is an endangered idea.
On the contrary, the right to security is an integral component of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 22) and an important part of the Millenium Development Goals (MDG), as conceived by the United Nations.
For the majority of African countries, social welfare systems are still evolving.
Each African government has chosen a system specific to its culture, with varying degrees of success, but all recognize the necessity of protecting at a minimum the most vulnerable populations.
An insufficient social protection system
Assane Fall-Diop summarizes the struggles that are still needed to achieve a real social welfare system in Africa :
A march demanding an end to sexual harassment turned ugly when women involved were attacked by a mob of angry men in Tahrir Square today (June 8, 2012).
Eye witnesses share their experience on Twitter.
Associated Press journalist Sarah El Deeb, who was present, describes what happened in the following tweets:
@seldeeb: The assault on the march of #EndSH was by many men- this was targeted to break it up and offend and assault participants.
@seldeeb: The men in the march #EndSH fended off against attackers but the number was huge and some women were cornered
@seldeeb: Some witnesses say ppl surrounding the march were already heckling the girls b4 the attack began #EndSH
May your hand be severed.
No to sexual harassment, reads a sign held at the protest.
Photograph shared on Twitter by Sarah El Deeb Reports of sexual harassment have continued to trickle throughout the months of protest.
Amira Howeidy provides context:
Turk4Syria asks if anyone ever gets arrested for harassing women and Mohamed Yahia responds:
@MohammedY: @Turk4Syria nobody ever does.
It is so systematic many suspect it's endorsed by those in power to intimidate female protesters #EndSH
Sherine Thabet suggests : @sherinethabet: ‬‏ الجملة اللي بقولها في كل حتة مع اي حد، المتحرش مش هايسمع الكلام، المتحرش مش هاتقدر توعيه، المتحرش لازم يكش، لازم المجتمع ينبذه، بس The sentence I repeat everywhere with everyone is: the harasser will not listen to anyone.
The harasser cannot be educated.
The harasser needs to disappear and the only way to do that is when society rejects them.
That's it.
And Deena Adel concludes:

This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Elections 2011/2012.
On June 24, a new president has been officially declared in Egypt and his name is Mohammed Morsi.
The Muslim Brotherhood's Morsi has become Egypt's first freely elected president, and like all other candidates, he has his own presidential program and promises that voters - supposedly - elected him based on.
But how can Egyptians hold Morsi accountable for his promises and watch the progress in achieving them?
Wael Ghonim tweeted about a new application for that.
@Ghonim: Tracking the performance of #Morsi (Egypt's newly elected president): http://www.morsimeter.com (via @ezzatkamel)
MorsiMeter, Tracking the performance of Morsi, the newly elected president of Egypt
The application is created by Zabatak, (@Zabatak), a non-profit initiative which aims at making Egypt become bribery free, corruption-free and safe.
And on MorsiMeter's Facebook page, they describe the application as follows : The is an initiative to document and monitor the performance of the new Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi, and we will monitor what has been achieved from what he had promised in his program during his first 100 days in power.
Egyptian netizens shared their thoughts and opinions about the meter on Twitter as follows:
@omarkamel: MorsiMeter NOT a bad idea.
But must also measure how good we think those ideas are to start with.
Security plan SUCKS.
@AbdoRepublic: Brilliant idea to assess #morsi 's performance.
Goodbye Dictatorship

Popular Indain actor Shahrukh Khan (@imsrk) tweets about his memories from the famous Gahzal singer:
@imsrk: memories of my mom cooking in a grimy kitchen as it rained outside, while mehdi hassan floated out of a Beltek 2 in 1 (cassette player).
Singer Lata Mangeshkar offered her condolence to Mehdi Hassan's family talking to the media and said that his demise is a great loss to music industry.
Asif Noorani in Dawn blog says:
Mehdi Hassan is dead, but I am not sad.
Don’t curse me when I say I am relieved, for death has brought an end to his decade-long suffering. Watching him lie helpless and speechless, afflicted by so many ailments, not to speak of bedsores, was a heart-wrenching experience.
Adil Omar (@Adil_Omar) tweets:
@Adil_Omar:I won't pretend that I listened to his music, but I was well aware of his status and impact.
RIP Mehdi Hassan
Singer Talat Aziz, who was trained by Mehdi Hassan describes how he feels:
I feel a tremendous personal sense of loss.
I was his 'shagird' (apprentice), I spent a lot of time with him.
For me he was a star.
I don't have words to describe his loss.
He was a great asset to the world of Ghazal.
Though he was not singing for quite sometime, but he will be missed.
There will never be another Mehdi Hassan.
Please check out Fawad's tribute to Mehdi Hassan, whom he terms as one of the greatest sub-continental singers of the post-partition era.
Unlike other countries in the region, Sudan is grossly underreported, and this was ever so evident during Friday and Saturday’s street demonstrations.
The Sudanese government keeps a tight grip on local media and bans journalists from reporting on issues of human rights and corruption.
This however does not justify the blatant lack of interest from international media outlets.
Al Jazeera, for instance, played a prominent role in reporting the uprisings in several Arab countries, but netizens say it seems to ignore the events currently unfolding in Sudan.
Sudanese women at the forefront of #SudanRevolts.
The media coverage of recent protests in Sudan was confined to articles in Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera, including some snippets on Al Jazeera’s English Channel.
Other news outlets to cover the protests include CNN, the Malaysian news outlet The Star, the New York Times, Yahoo News, ABC News, and the Chicago Tribune.
Nonetheless, this has not brought enough attention to the issues on the ground, as most of these news outlets don’t have much impact in the region, say netizens.
The protests kicked off after Friday prayers in a mosque in Wad Nubawi neighborhood in Omdurman.
A call for protests tagged as #SandstormFriday was made a day earlier.
The demonstrations were organized to protest against rising prices and the government’s new austerity plans that were announced by Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir and implemented last week.
Those who heard about the protest made their way there.
Hamid was one of them; he tweeted : On my way to Al-Sayed Abdelrahman mosque in Wad Nubawi.
After prayer, people gathered in front of the mosque and marched on one of the main roads in Wad Nubawi chanting anti-regime slogans.
This protest lasted a few hours before police dispersed the crowd with tear gas and plain clothed police men infiltrated the ranks of the protesters.
After the protests were disbanded, Yousif Al Mahdi was on the scene and tweeted:
Protest back on inside district, wad nubawi fighting back, police cars in sideroads & firing tear gas @ houses
At the same time, similar protests started in Burri neighbourhood of Khartoum, and eventually in Al-Daim.
The protests in Burri were quickly suppressed by security personnel and police.
Al-Daim however was too much for the authorities to handle.
Ammar Mahdi tweets:
Hours ago from ‪#AlDaim district , ppl throwing police signs and step on them.
Moez Ali shares a photograph of a burning police car on Twitter The protests in Al-Daim went on into the night with several police trucks burnt by protesters.
Haitham Makkawi was on the ground and claimed that Al-Daim residents have taken over the scene:
Al-Daim residents have completely taken over!
Photos of burnt down police trucks were all over twitter showing the aftermath of the protests.
Later that night another protest started in Siteen Street, a main road in Khartoum next to Riyad neighbourhood; this photo shows protesters gathering around a burnt tyre in the middle of the road.
Girifna, a non-violent movement, used social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to convey information about the whereabouts of protests around the tri-state capital.
In this tweet , Girifna directs people to the location of new protests in Omdurman: Girifna - Omdurman: Calling on the residents of Omdurman to head now to Al-Sabeel and Al-Doha roundabout
Girifna’s efforts portray the advantages of citizen journalism in a country where free speech and reporting is suppressed.
The Sudanese online community was overjoyed by the events unfolding in the capital Khartoum; Hamid Murtada, who was at the heart of the protests, tweeted : Allah-u-Akbar and Al Hamdulillah ..
The country is on fire..
It's on, it's on! Some of the Sudanese Twitter users likened the events happening in Khartoum to those in other countries in the region and maintained solidarity with those struggling with dictatorial regimes elsewhere.
Khalid Ewais, a journalist with Al Arabiya, tweeted : Salute to the revolutionaries of Syria who are supporting our revolution despite their circumstances, as for those who are mocking Sudan and its people we tell them: This is not our first revolution
The Sudanese Diaspora were on standby for those who needed help on the ground giving tips on how to document the protests and possible use of social media sites in the advent of an internet shutdown.
Nada, a Sudanese residing in Egypt, advised on how best to cover the demonstrations:
if u are an IPHONE user & are amongst the protesters in sudan, download USTREAM thru the app. world. ‪#SudanRevolts.
The online Sudanese community seems optimistic about the course of the Sudanese revolution, where many promise that June 30, 2012 will be the ruling National Congress Party's final anniversary.
Sudanese officials are repeating the all too familiar 'lies' Arab officials have been telling us since the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring in December 2010.
Protests are contained, they say, in citizens attacking policemen, who retaliate in self-defense, goes the story.
Sudan is the latest country to join the massive protest movement that saw the toppling of Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali of Tunisia in January 2011 and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt the following month.
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi was also captured and later on killed by an angry mob in October 2011.
Arab governments are keen in limiting their loss to those three dictators by conducting a massive crackdown on political dissent and an unprecedented killing spree against their revolting people.
Sudanese officials are now repeating the same lines we heard from all Arab officials, whose reigns are troubled by angry people they have continued to rule with an iron fist and oppress for decades.
Mimz reacts to how the official Sudanese News Agency (SUNA) covered the news.
@MimzicalMimz: SUNA says protests yesterday were 'limited'. Just the fact that protests were acknowledged conveys the magnitude of #SudanRevolts
Egyptian journalist Salma Elwardany, who is in Khartoum, sums up the coverage.
She writes : ملخص تغطية وكالة الانباء الرسمية لمظاهرات امس: مواطنين اعتدوا على الشرطة فاضطروها لاستخدام الغاز المسيل للدموع ‎http://suna-sd.net/suna/showNews/-fJi7HGycvs26Azq7aG4mmjptp-NQZ_WndSuVb1-KMY/1‏ ‎‫#الخراء‬‏ @S_Elwardany: A summary of SUNA's official coverage of the news yesterday: citizens attacked the police, who were forced to use tear gas
She quotes the coverage saying: وتهيب الشرطة بالمواطنين "عدم الالتفات للشائعات التي تؤدى لزعزعة الامن وتعريض الممتلكات للخطر والتعاون مع الشرطة في أداء واجباتها" ‎‫#السودان‬‏ @S_Elwardany: The Police call upon citizens not to pay attention to rumours aimed at destabilizing security and the destruction of property.
It also calls on citizens to cooperate with the police in carrying out their duties
And she adds: لشرطة تنفي في بيانها ليلة امس استخدام الرصاص المطاطي او الحي, صح الاصابات امبارح كانت من وحي خيال المواطن ‎‫#السودان_ينتفض‬‏ @S_Elwardany: The police denies in its statement last night the use of rubber or live bullets.
Right!
The injuries last night were a figment of our imagination
Yousif Elmahdi confirms:
Netizens are now watching Sudan closely, following rumours that the Sudanese authorities intend to cut off the Internet - a chilling reminder of Egypt's attempt to silence activists and contain the January 25 revolution when it pulled the plug off the www on January 27.
The US Embassy in Khartoum Twitter account stated today:
@USembassykrt: Internet access and possibly cell phones may be disrupted or limited in Sudan due to the protests and demonstrations in the capital city.
The internet and the rise of social media, and not dictatorship, injustice and lack of human rights, are blamed for fueling the Arab Spring.
Meanwhile, Arab regimes seem to be immune to learning from experience.

On Twitter, Jordanian Ali Alhasani reports:
@_AHA: BREAKING: Reports that Internet has been CUT in #Sudan.
If true then god be with them because we won't know anything! #SudanRevolts
Four hours ago, Egyptian journalist Salma Elwardany, who is reporting from Khartoum, tweeted:
@S_Elwardany: news that sudan govt might cut off internet #Sudanrevolts
In preparation for the anticipated blackout, a Speak to Tweet service has been set up.
Rodrigo Davies tweets about it:
@BSonblast: @SudaneseThinker @Usiful_ME is in Sudan and he's still tweeting.
and Israeli Elizabeth Tsurkov adds:
@Elizrael: @JustAmira @SudaneseThinker seeing way too many people tweeting from Sudan for it to be true... See @elizrael/sudanpeeps
Protests broke out at Khartoum University on June 17, when hundreds of students denounced the government’s planned austerity measures.
The protests were met with police brutality and arrests, fueling more anger and protests the following days.
CNN's Ben Wedeman comments:
@bencnn: If #Egypt weren't such a 24/7 news tsunami #Sudan might be getting more attention.
Sudan has a rich history of rebellion and revolution.
Arab Revolution adds:
@ArabRevolution: Watching #SudanRevolts videos reminds me of how #Yemen started.
Tens in the street, but very passionate.
All out revolution within weeks.
And the lack of news in mainstream media of what is happening in Sudan is annoying activists.
Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas asks : هو ليه الجزيرة ... مش بتغطي احداث السودان تماما؟ ‬@waelabbas: Why isn't Al Jazeera covering the incidents in Sudan at all?
Al Jazeera, which provided blanket live coverage of the Egyptian revolution from its epi-centre in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo, has been credited with 'exporting' the revolution spark to the living rooms of homes across the Arab world.
Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has been in power since 1986.
Before the last elections in 2011, some people thought he was not coming back for the third term, but he surprisingly showed up and worn the election.
He then said he would retire at 75.
When his third term comes to an end in 2016 he will be just 72, meaning he will still be capable of standing for the fourth term.
A few weeks ago, citizens started speculating about who will succeed the president if he does not come back in 2016 for a forth term.

Some of the names listed in the speculation included his wife Janet Kataha Museveni, his son Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Amama Mbabazi, the current Prime Minister and Museveni's close friend, and Rebecca Kadaga, the current speaker of Parliament.
Rumors started moving round in Uganda that the president was supporting his wife Janet for succession.
Ugandans quickly took to social media platforms to discuss the rumors.
Twitter:
@Since__1986 thought Janet Museveni has been a virtual president all along:
@Since__1986: Janet Museveni for President?
What are Ugandans Smoking?
Chic has been virtual president for 26yrs!!!
Oh God!.
@kristinrawls asked:
@kristinrawls: @mjwilkerson What are your thoughts on Museveni endorsing his wife for presidency?
Is it legitimate support?
Will he just stay in office?
@mjwilkerson answered:
@mjwilerson: @kristinrawls No worries-Janet could contend but truth is Musevenino longer has political capital to dictate who's next, just influence it
@shopetie_101 thought Janet succeeding the president is a sign of greed:

But this gentleman President wants his wife JanetMuseveni to succeed him and opposition is coming from nowhere.
I want to agree with somebody sometime who suggested that African rulers- in fact African politicians including or especially Nigerians, aspiring to rule should undergo compulsory pyschiatric examinations to ascertain their mental balance since MOST of them behave like mental patients.
Don't you agree?

Benon M Gowa compared Janet Museveni to other female politicians in other parts of the world:
Eehm, Mama Janet Kataaha Museveni(nee Kainembabazi),the country's First Lady since May 1986 has fast drawn out quite an impressive C.V, elevating her status from a mere itinerary mother figure to an elected M.P representing Ruhaama County then State Minister for Karamoja Affairs(16th February, 2009) currently to Cabinet Minister for Karamoja Affairs(27th May, 2011) AND no serious thinker should doubt the pending reality, that with the restoration of Presidential Term Limits, it will all then be within the bounds of possibility that she could be fronted by ruling NRM as the Party's flag bearer to run for Presidency jest like with Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Argentina's current president who was annointed by her husband's Party(Frente Para La Vietoria) to replace him after his tenure expired in 2007 though the Democrats(in the US)outrightly rejected Hilary Rodmahn Clinton...
Medo Joseph wondered whether Africa will ever develop with this kind of "African madness":
Medo Joseph President Yoweri Museveni is stepping down,First Lady Janet Kataaha Museveni has emerged as the preferred successor to the president!AFRICAN MADNESS!When will Africa Develope?

A giant Nshima pot, Zambia 2008.

Nshima, the stodgy porridge-like substance cooked out of maize-meal, has divided families and triggered food riots in Zambia at one time or other.
This is why subsequent governments have kept a keen eye on the growing, harvesting, buying and selling of maize-meal to consumers.
The production of maize — or corn as it is known in other parts of the world — is an even bigger issue in the mining region of the Copperbelt and metropolitan areas like the capital, Lusaka, where large working populations rely on the commercial supply of the product.
Accordingly, maize determines the political direction of the nation.
In May, the World Bank urged the Zambian government not to interfere in determining the floor prices of maize sold by farmers to the Food Reserve Agency and other interested parties in the agri-business chain.
Despite such calls, the Ministry of Agriculture announced this year’s floor price of maize at K65,000 (about $13 USD) per 50 kilo bag.
World Bank country director for Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe, Kundhavi Kadiresan criticized the decision and claimed that poor Zambian farmers were being exploited as some traders were buying maize from them in anticipation of re-selling it at a higher price to the state-run Food Reserve Agency.
Kadiresan also indicated that the World Bank is deeply concerned that not only does the government’s policy fail to ensure the long term sustainable growth of the agriculture sector, it also does very little to create jobs and reduce poverty.
Kadiseran could be excused.
Zambia’s agriculture sector revolves around maize, never mind the growing of other crops and livestock.
The bulk of the maize is grown by peasant farmers who are faced with regular droughts during the rainy season, an unreliable and expensive supply of fertilizer, and difficulties transporting the commodity to markets.
In 1986, Zambians in the Copperbelt and Lusaka regions rioted because the price of maize increased several fold when incomes were stagnant.
Four years later, unrest over price increases even sparked a coup attempt.
Announcing the new maize floor price, agriculture and livestock minister Emmanuel Chenda said:
We have taken this decision in order to protect the food security of the country and also to ensure that small-scale farmers are not discouraged from producing the crop in subsequent years… To ensure that Zambian maize is competitive on the international markets, the Government will ensure that production costs are reduced through, among other strategies, the provision of agricultural extension training and transportation for mobility to extension workers with a view to increasing productivity among the small-scale farmers.
Chenda also revealed that the Government was putting in place programs to build additional storage facilities as a long-term measure to avoid wastage under the Food Reserve Agency (FRA).
A few days before the minister’s statement, the FRA had destroyed huge stocks of rotten maize in various districts of the country.
Said Chenda:
I wish to inform the nation that most of the waste under the FRA we have been experiencing is due to inadequate and unsuitable storage facilities… In order to address this challenge, Government has begun to put in place programs to build additional storage facilities as a long-term measure.

If you are not used to reading success stories about education in Afghanistan, this one is for a change.
On 30 June, 2012 the Center of Science in Kabul announced that Khalilullah Yaqubi, a high school student from Ghazni province, had independently discovered a mathematical formula that can be used to solve 'second-degree quadratic equations with one unknown'.
Khalilullah is an eleventh-grade student at the Al-Beruni High School in Nawabad, on the outskirts of the city of Ghazni.
Speaking about the formula, Khalilullah says:
I have not seen this formula before in any book.
Neither I have used any source, nor cheated from Internet.
This is all my efforts.
Through this formula we can solve the problems of degree of equations (sic).
Some Twitter users have welcomed the news as an indication of improvements in the Afghan education sector.
Mulex, for example, has tweeted:
Wow!
Amazing news from Afghanistan.
Sign of progress in their education system.
Another Twitter user, Jasur Ashurov ('A settled nomad from Central Asia'), wrote:
You don't always get positive news from #Afghanistan.
This why I've been so happy to read this.
Rephrasing a Russian scientist and poet, he added :
Our country Afghanistan is one of the countries where proper attention has not been paid to education sector.
One of the basic reasons has been the continuous instability overwhelming the society.
The wars and conflicts - national, regional and international – that have been using Afghan land as their theater have made the development in social and educational fields suffocate to a large extent.
Starting from Soviet invasion in 1979, one can count myriads of tussles and disturbances hampering the establishment of satisfactory education system.
The problems, more basic in nature, have been the focal point of people's concentration rather than the education system.
Despite all these difficulties, many Afghans succeed in becoming educated, sometimes even self-educated.
In December 2011, another talented resident of Ghazni, without any special training or tools, flew an aircraft he had built from bits of rickshaw and a secondhand Toyota car in his garden.
Alexander Sodiqov has contributed to this post.
Open Society Foundation and Disability Right Initiative have formed an organization to cater specifically to the disabled African youth - African Youth With Disability Network.
Through the network, African youths around the continent with disability received training on social media skills and how to work and portray themselves as journalists:
for the promotion, adoption and ratification of the United Nations Convention on disabled people.
The YI and DRI saw a dire need to set up a specifically African organization, which gave rise to the African Youth with Disabilities Network (AYWDN).
This group was created as a way to bring together young Africans from across the continent with the aim of creating inclusive societies where people with disabilities can live better lives with dignity and contribute to and influence the internal political debates.

Earlier this month, a workshop was held in Dakar, Senegal and several countries including Uganda, Kenya, Senegal, Zambia, and Tunisia.
Persons with disability are not just covered in positive light but no light at all.
The workshop empowered persons with disability with techniques on how to handle and take over media especially the social media and included communication and writing techniques.
Rebecca, an active Kenyan blogger, discusses the workshop on her blog:
This week I had a fabulous week with a group of young people; training on media, whether new or old is never easy.
The media in every country is almost guilty of similar things; they don’t cover our issues, they entrench prejudice and stereotypes in most cases never have time to write and air positive stories.
The workshop educated and trained the disabled so that they can in turn educate the public using tools such as Twitter and Facebook.
Rebecca writes:
When you think new media training, you probably think I do all the sexy stuff like using infographics to make your website interactive or how to have a dancing or a fancy AVI on twitter.
No, think basics on how to set up a Facebook page, why it is important, why you should be on twitter, looking for other people in your country on twitter and seeing why they have so many followers and why or what you should do to get followers.
Think about growing up in rural Uganda, in a wheelchair, motivated by a mother who believes that you must get educated and achieve your potential no matter the circumstances, think about pushing a wheelchair through the muddy roads when it rains, but most of all, think about the village schoolmates in primary school who had to wake up two hours earlier so that they can help push you two miles to the primary school.

Deputy Secretary General for Administration at Federation of Liberian Youth, Daintowon Pay-bayee ,says, “disability is not inability.”
She then asks, "you have heard that before but what is your perception if you first meet a disabled person?"
Ms Pay-bayee refuses to be judged because of what she is that's why she will keep working on her dream:
Disability is not inability.
To fight discrimination and change public perceptions, we need to begin talking about youth with disabilities in our homes, our neighborhoods, and on the national and international stage.Donors, governments, and the media need to give this issue urgent attention.
Perceptions of people with disabilities are degrading.
We need to encourage the potential in all of our young people.
I will keep working for my dream of living in an inclusive society where I am judged not by my physical limitations but by my potential and my character.
Daintowon Pay-bayee, an ardent campaigner of people living with disability in Liberia, remembers when she got disabled at the age of five.
There are photos, posts and tweets about the workshop on OSIWA Facebook page, OSIWA Twitter page and AYWDN Facebook page.
OSIWA Program Coordinator Kanja Sesay shared insights from the workshop on Twitter:

Power lines over buildings in Cameroon, 2008.

After his reelection in November 2011, President Paul Biya of Cameroon announced that the country would soon become a giant “construction site”.
The goal for his new term is for Cameroon to reach emerging market status by 2035 through a series of “great achievements” in transport and energy infrastructure development .
It’s a deadline that fails to convince many commentators, if only because the challenges are so great.
Energy, and specifically electricity, is especially problematic.
Like many other African countries, Cameroon suffers from insufficient electricity supplies.
Journalist Leopold Nséké explains in an article published in Afrique Expansion Magazine:
Underequipped, the African continent is awash in the obsolescence of its facilities and bore the brunt of poor management of available resources.
Representing 15% of the world population, Africa consumes paradoxically only 3% of the total world production of electricity.
There is no electricity in Mafa Kilda village, it's just passing by (and going from Ngong to Garoua).
By Philippe Semanaz on Flickr in 2006 (CC BY-SA 2.0)
According to some estimates (fr) only 20% of Cameroon’s population has a regular access to electricity supplies.
Indeed, those who have access to power tend to experience cuts in supply as often as every three days.
Electricity is also increasingly expensive commodity for most of the country’s citizens.
The privately-owned AES Sonel, for example, recently announced a 7% rise in prices starting from June 1, 2012.
Limited access to electricity also represents a threat to the industrialization of Cameroon, which in turn could undermine Cameroon’s ambition of becoming emerging economy by 2035.
A study conducted by the Polytechnic National High School of Yaounde outlined that:
Production losses were estimated at EU91.5 million per year in industrial enterprises because of the difficulties in supplying electricity.
These results indicate that inadequate and poor quality of electricity supply has slowed industrial development.
Yet unreliable electricity supplies are also a major concern for the wider population. Feowl is a new community-led initiative that aims to refine and provide currently absent data on the impact of poor electricity supply in Douala, the economic center of Cameroon.
As Cameroon essentially relies on hydro-energy production, the Government also launched the construction of the Lom Pangar dam in the east of the country.
The project – funded by the World Bank and other international organizations - is considered to be integral to Cameroon’s aspirations to become an emerging economy.
The dam is expected to the increase energy production of Cameroon with a planned capacity of 7.250 billion cubic meters for a reservoir that will cover 610 km2.
Water supplies will also be held in reserve for the dry season at two damns further downstream of the Sanaga River, thereby enabling them to generate more electricity.
Christiane Badgley’s blog highlights some of the shortcomings of the project.
She is concerned that the electricity produced will mainly prioritize the needs of Cameroon’s industries :
…the urban and rural poor do not appear to be the primary beneficiaries of the Lom Pangar project.
Instead, the dam is designed to regulate the flow of the Sanaga River in order to increase energy production from existing and proposed downstream hydropower plants serving the southern electricity grid and the country’s single largest electricity consumer, the Alucam aluminum smelter.
Jointly owned by the government of Cameroon and the Canadian-based company Alcan, Alucam plans to more than double its production and needs new sources of cheap energy to do so.

The Ladies in White (Las Damas de Blanco) are again top of mind with Cuban diaspora bloggers.
As one of the oldest and most respected opposition entities on the island, their peaceful protests - and regular arrests by state security forces - continue to attract attention.
The most recent confrontation happened this past weekend as members of the group attempted to carry out two protests in Havana.
Pedazos de la Isla, which chronicled the events in photographs, noted that:
Despite the government repression, more than 40 Ladies in White carried out their accustomed march to the Santa Rita Church in Havana this Sunday, June 17th, to celebrate Father’s Day.
When the mass concluded, these women decided to catch their oppressors off guard and marched for the second time in one day, this time from Infanta street to Neptune Street.
The blog also posted two other entries about state action against members of the Ladies in White.
The first detailed how Caridad Caballero Batista, her husband and son were searched and detained:
After visiting some relatives...they were intercepted by the political police upon arriving to the province of Holguin.
According to Caballero, the police agent who intercepted the vehicle her family was traveling on...told the driver to hand him his documentation.
However, the activist explains that 'more than for the purpose of asking to see the driver’s documents, this action was intentionally aimed at searching my husband Esteban and the bag he was carrying, which was full of clothes'.
The agent ordered Esteban to get off the vehicle in order to search him, to which the dissident replied that he was not going to allow, considering that he 'is not a delinquent'.
Caballero says that 'the agents were infuriated and told Esteban that he was committing a crime'.
The response of the agents was to shove Esteban Sandez into a vehicle of the Operational Guard to take him to the Police Unit, where he’d be searched and detained.
Upon seeing this, Caridad Caballero and her son Eric Sandez got off the car and began to protest against the arbitrariness, assuring the agents that if they were going to take Esteban, then they’d have to them too.
In a matter of minutes, the three activists were taken to a police unit located on the outskirts of Holguin.
After a number of hours, the family was released, but upon arriving to their home in the city of Holguin they noticed that the political police had already set up the accustomed weekend operation in order to impede them from arriving to Sunday Mass.
Obstruction from attending Holy Mass has been one of the tactics employed by state security to contain the activity of the group.
The second post told of the arrest of an elderly member of the group:
This Father’s Day, Ladies in White throughout all of Cuba mobilized with the purpose of carrying out peaceful activities to celebrate the date.
As a consequence, the regime’s police forces responded with a repressive operation which began days prior, resulting in the arrests of countless of these women throughout all of the island’s provinces.
Among those arrested was 75 year-old Blanca Hernández Moya, who suffered physical attacks at the hands of police agents...
The elderly woman...was on her way from her home in Central Havana to the headquarters of the Ladies in White- the home of the fallen leader of the group, Laura Pollan, located on Neptuno Street- when she was violently intercepted by state police.
They attacked me', said Moya, 'they shoved me into a vehicle, and a female agent twisted my arm and hit me'.
After some minutes, the vehicle which the Lady in White was in parked and she was kicked out, being left abandoned by a dam near the desolate area known as Penalver, on the outskirts of Cotorro.
Capitol Hill Cubans also took notice of the weekend's arrests.

Hello World and jambo from Kenya!
Welcome to the Global Voices podcast.
What is the future of online citizen media?
In this edition (and the next) you will hear from editors, authors, co-founders and other participants at the 2012 Global Voices Citizen Media Summit in Nairobi to discuss the future of how we all work together online.
The Global Voices Summit takes place every two years and there are many topics on the agenda, possibly too many to fit into one podcast but certainly a lot of food for thought right here.
First, let's go way back, a long time in internet years and consider the origins of that thing we call Global Voices.
Co-founder Ethan Zuckerman explains how Global Voices came to be, what happens at the Summits, and what he thinks the future holds.
The #GV2012 Summit is a place to meet and find out more about our authors, editors and contributors who travelled from all corners of the world.
Everyone was excited, but one of the most thrilled participants was Elaine Díaz from Havana, Cuba.
Here she explains a little more about citizens online in Cuba.
It wouldn’t be a Global Voices gathering without smart and vocal people from around the world.
Andrea Arzaba is a journalist in Mexico and she collected some observations of the event, starting with her own reflections.
Daudi Were is a Kenyan blogger who writes on Mentalacrobatics.
He was also the very entertaining MC during the public Summit meeting attended by 300 people.
He explained his connection with Global Voices and how Kenyan technology continues to innovate, particularly in the area of mobile.

The impact of citizen media
Through Global Voices, many people who are sometimes overlooked are able to have their views and reports amplified.
Leila Nashawati Rego is a Spanish and Syrian human rights activist.
She teaches communications at Carlos the Third University in Spain as well as write for a number of respected outlets.
We discussed the growth of online citizen media and the results of that expansion.
So long, but not goodbye
Some bitter-sweet news came out of the Global Voices Summit too.
Sami Ben Gharbia from Tunisia told us that he is stepping down from the position of Director of Global Voices Advocacy.
So, naturally it was time to take a look at the work that he has done and find out what he will be up to next.
As ever, thanks to all of our contributors, producers and music makers who help to make this happen.
You can find out more about the summit by checking the Twitter hashtag #GV2012 and by taking a look at the dedicated Summit pages.

Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has died at least once every few weeks since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, which toppled his 32-year reign.
Netizens react to the latest speculations regarding his health.
Lubna F. reassured her readers that Mubarak's health status is a recurring news item.
She wrote:
@fatanil: Dear foreigners, sensing that many of you are confused.
So to clarify, Mubarak is dead/alive-ISH.
Happens every few weeks, dont worry.
And Jonathan Moremi once tweeted a schedule for Mubarak's death:
@jonamorem: BREAKING: #Mubarak will die today at 11:57 AM and then again at 4:12 PM.
Please show compassion.
Next show tomorrow at 7:48 AM and 3:44 PM
However, on June 19, news of Mubarak's death seemed real.
‏
@Ekramibrahim: I think #Mubarak has officially died. #Egypt
But once again, the Egyptian (and foreign journalists) fell pray to Mubarak's death rumors. An hour later, news came that Mubarak was still alive, or may be came back from death as Ms. Entropy tweeted:
@MsEntropy: #MubarakConspiracy I'll start. #Mubarak is just imitating Jesus in a bid for support from Copts.
You never learn, do you? #Mubarak never dies. Josh Shahryar shared the ingredients of the potion used to revive Mubarak:
@JShahryar: Anonymous sources told me potion containing Gaddafi's claws, Prince Nayef's fangs and Assad's horns used to revive #Mubarak.
Imran Garda has a different theory about Mubarak's continuous heart attacks.
@ImranGarda: Egyptians are always skeptical about news that mentions #Mubarak's heart.
They were never absolutely certain he had one.
With all those wondering how many times Mubarak will continue to live, or die, Bassem Sabry tweeted:
@Bassem_Sabry: While I cannot verify this at all, a popular story claims Mubarak's father lived to 104 years of age, and supposedly died of a car accident.
Nathan Nemo was worried about how many times Mubarak's Wikipedia page should be updated.
Melissa Rose suggested Mubarak Zombie to be as cool band's name and Buddhas Hag tweeted:
@BuddhasHag: I don’t believe in love at first sight, I believe in death at first heart attack.
But again Mubarak has to prove me wrong.
Not only Wikipedia, but also newspapers were forced to edit their previous stories about his death.
NewsDiffs (@newsdiffs), which watches different versions of highly-placed articles on online news sites, published a comparison showing how New York Times' story was updated when it turned out he was still alive.
News about the life or death of the former president is not the only information that cannot be confirmed in Egypt nowadays.
There is also uncertainty about the next president, with both presidential candidates Ahmed Shafiq and Mohammed Morsi claiming they won last week's run off elections.
@the_blacklisted: Shafik and Morsy won and lost the election.
Mubarak is alive and dead.
The military is and isn't the leader of Egypt.
Yet I'm still unhappy.
And finally, in case you are reading this few days later, and wondering whether Mubarak is now alive or dead now, don't worry, there is an application for that.
In Egypt, sexual harassment is a serious problem, and one which more and more Egyptians are speaking out against.
A protest was held in Cairo's Nasr City on July 4 by young Egyptians, both male and female, in order to send a message against harassment.
Since the revolution took place, Egyptians both online and offline have been standing up against sexual harassment and gender-based violence.
In June a march against sexual harassment was attacked.
Nevertheless, initiatives to combat harassment continue.
The aim of the July 4 protest was to take a stand against sexual harassment and to demand safe streets for all. Maged Tawfiles was there and took the following photos (all images reproduced with permission):
On a short series of posts, professor Carlos Serra writes about some of the reasons why Mozambique's blogsphere is fading away.
One reader comments that blogging requires a load of work in order to ensure updates and quality.
Whereas Serra says that social media may need to be blamed, despite the pros of its usage.
On 3 July, 2012 the news channel Al Jazeera broadcast a documentary that investigated the mysterious death of Palestinian president Yasser Arafat.
He died in Paris on 11 November, 2004 and the documentary alleges that rather than dying of natural causes, Arafat was poisoned with polonium.
Both during and after the airing of the documentary, many Palestinian Twitter users tweeted their thoughts and reactions regarding the evidence presented in it.
The majority were not surprised by the allegations that Arafat was poisoned, something that has long been claimed by many.
However the allegation that polonium was used was a new detail.
‏Yasser Arafat at the World Economic Forum in Davos, January 2001.
Image by Remy Steinegger (CC BY-SA 2.0).Twitter user This Is Gaza tweeted: Al Jazeera reveals new facts about Arafat's death after a nine-month investigation found high levels of the poisonous element polonium in the belongings of president Arafat.
And I commented: Everyone is now wondering what new information was given in the Al Jazeera documentary, when the whole nation knew he was poisoned. What's new is that evidence is provided, when at first there were just rumours. Many Palestinians questioned why the documentary was being broadcast now, and resorted to conspiracy theories as an explanation.
Twitter user Majd responded: It is galling when those who have conspired for eight years to hide the truth of Yasser Arafat's assassination, then say when someone comes to reveal the truth, "Your timing is suspicious!"

Nour Abed did not hide her bad opinion of Al Jazeera and the media in general, but she did praise it for the documetary: We all know that Al Jazeera like any other channel has an agenda, with its reasons and aims behind every new action, but you cannot deny that it has revealed new information about Arafat's death.
Diana Alzeer was looking forward to even more answers:
‏@ManaraRam: The next question I want an answer for is "Who killed Arafat?"
Ismaeil Mohaisen tweeted some accusations against the Palestinian Authority: ‏ We are still waiting for a comment from the Palestinian Authority.
There is no doubt of that!
In a similar vein, Rami Khrais tweeted: The biggest blow to the Palestinian Authority - besides Suha Arafat's request for an examination for poison in her husband's remains - is the report pointing out that no investigation took place after his death. The documentary ended with Yasser Arafat's widow Suha Arafat requesting that the Palestinian Authority exhume her late husband’s body so the investigation could be continued.
President Mahmoud Abbas made a statement saying that the Palestinian Authority "saw no reason" why the body should not be exhumed.
We are now waiting to see what will happen next.
Somalia has not had a central government controlling the entire country since the fall of Muhammad Siad Barre in 1991.
The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) is the internationally recognized government of the Republic of Somalia.
After political discussions in Ethiopian, leaders of various Somali parties agreed to political steps to end the transitional period and elect a new president.
One of the steps outlined in a detailed timetable is the drafting of a new constitution.
Technical Revision Committee for the new constitution participated in a 4-day working session in Nairobi:

A four-day working session with the Signatories’ Technical Revision Committee has been concluded in Nairobi.
The working session is a follow up to the recent Addis Signatories’ meeting were most of the constitutional issues were agreed and some of the provisions – prepared by the Independent Federal Constitution Commission – have been amended after congenial political negotiations between the signatories of the Roadmap to end the transition, which was adopted in Mogadishu last September.
The technical Revision Committee’s mandate as per Addis Ababa’s Communiqué is to complete the constitutional process.
The Minister of Constitutional Affairs who convened the meeting explained to the participants and the media that “that road towards ending of the transition is getting closer and closer by the day, and we need to collectively work towards delivering a constitution that Somalia deserves and which serves its people.

Mahad Abdalle Awad, Deputy-Minister Ministry of Planning International Cooperation in Somalia, is optimistic that the country will soon have a new constitution:
Fearmongers use scare tactics to influence public opinion to impede change and progress by disseminating false information about the draft constitution and the planned Constituent Assembly meeting.
Naysayers, natural skeptics and cynical people among us, habitually express negativity about the accomplishment of others and are pessimistic about change.
Dale Carnegie’s famous quote fittingly describes the nature of Naysayers when he wrote “Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do.”
These Naysayers often spread blatant lies to oppose anything other people do.
In the case of the Constituent Assembly, they assert that the constitution can only be approved by popular referendum, disregarding discernible historical fact that the Somali Republic itself was founded by the 1960 Constitution, approved by Constituent Assembly of only 110 delegates, and a process that took only 29 days, whereby public referendum was held 21st of July 1961, after more than one year.
However, Mohamed Ali Hassan, Chairman of the Somali-American Peace Council and Manuela Melandri, PhD candidate at University College London, note that most Somalis look at the draft constitution with deep skepticism:
The optimism of the international community is not shared by Somalis themselves, who instead look with deep skepticism at a document that they perceive as externally-imposed, faulty and fundamentally undemocratic.
To understand this dynamic, one should start by questioning the facts.
What is wrong with the new Somali Constitution and why has the adoption of this document been met with resistance by educated Somalis, religious figures, secularists, former Somali Prime Ministers, women, scholars and by Somali Diaspora organizations?
First, there are issues concerning the content of the Constitution and the substance of its provisions.
Above all, the question of federalism remains deeply divisive.
Views can be found both in support of and against Somalia adopting a federal structure.

Somalis do not have time to wait for a a perfect constitution:
Whether we like it or not, when we see images of the Somali people around the world and we compare our own situation (at least, those in the Diaspora that live in peace), do we feel that those brothers and sisters need a constitution that works for them now since they are dealing with horrible situations?
Think about this: maxay ku gaaraan mustaqbalka?
You have to know that I did not write those news articles mentioned above, Iam not part of the group that put together of the new constitution and I am not here to justify whether the new constitution is good, bad or ugly.
All I want to remind you is that: those that are in need may not have time to wait a new perfect and pretty constitution; they need one that works for them for the time being. More importantly, I am not here to oppose anyone’s idea – I am just expressing my own views as anyone else.
However, the best solution that I see, at least in my opinion, let us commence discussing how to improve the new constitutions in the future.
Mohamud Uluso considers the draft constitution "a hurried job, with the latest version available only in Somali language while various outdated or fake versions are circulating on the web":
It appears that the UN-wise roadmap for Somalia is nothing but part of a plan of perfidy to keep Somalia and the Somalis in turmoil.
Instead of liberating the true Somalis, who need and want to continue living in and developing their own country and their communities inside Somalia, the planned constitution appears as the manifestation of the shackles of foreign as well as internal oppression of the indigenous Somali people in perpetuity.
According to insiders FGM is now permitted by the newly proposed Somali constitution, which will be presented for adoption to selected "traditional leaders".
A typical scheme how the UN and their stooges want to get it their way - or the way their master wants it.
Abduallhi Jamaa analyses various arguments about the draft constitution appearing online, vernacular radios and in village meetings and cafes:
Analysts say the proposed law is seemingly a milestone, but one that may fracture Somalia further into autonomous and semi-autonomous regions as well as ministates.
“There is absolute confusion.
There wasn’t any civic education to put across the letter and spirit of the proposed laws and this means that most people are not comfortable with the contents, many more have not heard about the whole process,” he told Somalia Report.
Amongst the contentious issues include the proposed model of government, the controversial issue of natural resources and the religious influence.
Some players argue that the language of the draft is not understandable, an issue that can lead to various kinds of misinterpretation.
It is related to an absence of public representation.
I do not wish to be part of a constituent assembly that does not represent Somalia’s vision and mission," said traditional elder Mohamed Hersi.
Google Ideas developed a pilot project with the Somali service, Africa Division of Voice of America (VOA) to help Somalis register their opinions with just a few clicks.
The poll shows, among other things, that Somalis want a Somalia based on the civil and criminal codes of Sharia, a strong central government and are divided over the inclusion of women in government.
Yesterday’s protests saw the arrest of many protesters from the streets by police and National Intelligence Security Service (NISS) agents.
Among them is prominent Sudanese Twitter personality and activist Usamah Mohammed Ali (@simsimt).
In his last tweet, Usamah was advocating free content to help spread the word about the events happening on the streets in the capital Khartoum:
Btw, I'm just being technical.
You can use my tweets without even mentioning me.
Free content advocate here!
Usamah’s last couple of tweets included information about his whereabouts and the situation on the ground.
He was in Burri area next to Nile Street :
#FreeUsamah @simsimt is not released yet!
And I don't know where is he!!
According to Asaad, Usamah was taken to NISS headquarters in Khartoum North while he himself was taken to a police station in Khartoum.
Usamah’s friends were tweeting their concern for his safety and demanding his immediate release.
Ayman Elkhidir showed his concern for Usamah,
Good night.
Hopefully tomorrow will bring better news from ‪#Sudan, with inshallah @Simsimt, Ahmed Hussein, and all the others free.
Several other Sudanese Twitter users have been arrested and released, such as Omer Mahgoub (@OmarMahgoub), who was released today.
He was held in the same building as Usamah, but says he has not seen him.
Usamah has been in the custody of the notorious NISS for over 24 hours, and his twitter friends are campaigning for him using #FreeUsamah.
In the wake of the ongoing protests taking place in Khartoum and other states calling on the fall of the regime, numerous other peaceful protesters have been kidnapped by the NISS and many of them were tortured.
The decades of war and terrorism have placed Afghanistan among the world's most dangerous countries.
Despite the progress made by the country since the ousting of the Taliban in 2001, most media writing about Afghanistan focus stubbornly on negative issues such as bomb blasts, suicide attacks, and casualties.
Reports in such media feature terrifying pictures that lead most people to never want to visit the war-torn but very beautiful country.
This is why the work of Antony Loveless, a freelance British journalist and photographer, makes so much difference.
Since March 2012, Loveless has been posting photos from his trips to Afghanistan on Twitter, using the hashtag he invented, #TheAfghanistanYouNeverSee.
Speaking to Global Voices about the hashtag, Loveless said:
I have a portfolio of over 2,000 images shot on three trips to Afghanistan in recent years and to keep track of them, I conceived of the rather unwieldy hashtag .

Loveless' hashtag was picked up by the Royal Air Force (RAF) Sergeant Alex Ford, who spent six months in 2011 in Afghanistan's Hilmand Province.
Sharing his views about the hashtag, Ford writes in Warfare Magazine:
We have been involved in Afghanistan for almost 11 years now, and it has become commonplace to see images of the war back here.
But generally those images tend to be more about the negative side of the conflict there.
Pictures of flag-draped coffins driving through Wootton Bassett or out of Brize Norton... a picture of a soldier smiling, but the caption underneath giving the date he died.
Sadly, the majority of the British population that supports the lads and lasses on the ground have no real insight into the story of the war out there; the story that is Afghanistan.

The hashtag has become a popular photo tag for those who travel to Afghanistan to share the images that people outside of the country rarely see in conventional media.

Lately, Iqbal Ahmad Oruzgani, a photographer from Afghanistan has also begun posting photos under the hashtag to show Afghanistan from a different perspective.

Every photo shared under this hashtag is retweeted by hundreds of Twitter users, giving the photographers a very wide audience.
Speaking to Global Voices, Antony Loveless says:
Countless tweeters have said it’s the best use of a hashtag on twitter, ever, and I am currently in talks to produce a book based on the hashtag after countless people expressed an interest in buying one.
Nodding disease is a mentally and physically disabling disease that affects children between 1 and 10 years.
It is currently restricted to small regions in South Sudan, Tanzania and northern Uganda.
The disease is incurable at the moment and its cause is not known.
Recently, some old people have also shown signs of the disease.
The areas affected by the disease are mainly in the northern region of the country.
The disease denies the children a chance to be productive as they cannot do anything for themselves, be it holding a knife to make a meal for the girls, and holding a hoe to plant a single seed for the boys.
An 18 year old man may look like a 3 year old boy and has to be carried around and held to get some heat in the body.
The first symptoms of this disease is the continuous nodding of the head, failure to eat and drink.
Later on the child becomes stunted physically and mentally.
A Ugandan journalist, Florence Naluyimba, has taken the first initiative to investigate and bring the issue to light.
She says although the government is trying to provide medicine to help the victims in 3 health centers, they have to travel long distances on foot or on bicycles to reach the health centers.
The sick ones cannot take themselves to the hospitals and have to be carried on the back or put on bicycles for over 30km.
The disease usually leads to seizures and at times this makes them fall into fire, sharp objects or in ponds/rivers, leading to death or severe injuries.
Many children have lost body parts such as fingers in these accidents.
It so happens that the victims can be too weak to even cry.
The Center for Disease Control plans to carry out aerial spraying targeting black flies, which are suspected to be the major cause of this illness.
It is not clear whether this will help or not.
Ugandan villagers complain that samples were taken to USA since 2010, but they have never received any reliable information about the cure and cause since that time.
Below are some pictures and YouTube videos about the disease.

Medical care is supposed to be free in Uganda.
However, there has been a consistent shortage of medicine and health workers in the national health centres.
A video produced by Results for Development, an international non-profit organisation whose mission is to unlock solutions to tough development challenges, was released online recently to encourage Ugandans to break their silence and take control of their health rights.
Introducing the video, Oscar Abello writes:
Uganda has made great strides in the past few years building up the "hardware" of its public distribution system for medicines – central warehouses and staffed distribution points – but the "software" isn’t quite right.
Many health centers run out of medicines in the 2-3 months between deliveries, meanwhile central warehouses are chock-full of supplies.
Medicine supply chain problems aren’t news to Uganda’s poor, many of them in remote rural villages, but few channels exist to bring that information to the public officials who are in position to do something about it.
In the video, Dennis Kibira, the medicines advisor at HEPS Uganda, a health consumer organization that helps increase access to essential medicine in Uganda says:
I want to see a country where people do not have to die because they have failed to receive the care that they deserve.
In 2006, three ministers lost their posts after it was reported that they were involved in embezzlement of funds from the health sector.
Their cases are still pending in court.

Rosette Mutambi, the founder and executive director of HEPS Uganda says in the video that health care is supposed to be free in Uganda, but it is not the case at the moment.
She adds that the health centres are operating over-capacity and that health workers are over-worked.
Uganda also has experiences power outages or load-shedding, which affects health centres that have no standby generators since some medicine needs refrigeration.
According to Moses Kamabare, the general manager of National Medical Stores, the organisation responsible for the storage and delivery of medicine to health centres, they makes one delivery every two months to all districts.
But a health worker on the ground says that the heath centers actually receive medicine once every three months.
Medical Stores iin Uganda are always full, but there are no drugs in the health centers.
Some people have to walk more than 10km to these health centers only to find that medicine is not there.
This experience is heartbreaking for many people and discourages them from coming back to the centres and seeking medical care.
A lot needs to be done to improve health care in Uganda: faster, more frequent service delivery, an increase in funding, more health centers, higher salaries for health workers, and procurement of equipment for centres.
There is also a challenge of shortage of doctors, some of whom allegedly steal medicine for their private clinics.
But the big question still stands, will this video encourage Ugandans to finally break the silence?
On July 1, Mexicans went to the polls to elect their next President.
From before the elections, the sentiment among most netizens was that it would be a close race between Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) from the Party of the Democratic Revolution, although supporters of Josefina Vázquez Mota (from the current ruling party) did not lose hope.
As soon as the polls opened, netizens began to share their thoughts and experiences.
Twitter user @YONOFUI affirmed:
Question: how did IFE manage to make a projection of Peña winning w/ 7-8% with only <25% of votes counted and the race getting tighter
While the community Think Mexican (@thinkmexican) pointed out:
By declaring EPN winner, AMLO is being pressured by media, Calderón and IFE to concede.
Why the rush?
What are they afraid of?
Real change?
Final results will be released on Wednesday, July 4.

The 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement started amid heavy security presence in Tehran, August 26, 2012.
The 120-nation strong Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a holdover from the Cold War's pull between East and West, is also seen by Iran and others as an alternative forum for current world discussions.
Iran says it has planned talks on a peace plan to end Syria's civil war, but no rebel factions will attend because of Tehran's close bonds with Bashar Assad's regime.
Tehran's 'non-declared curfew'
The Summit is being held from 26-31 August in Tehran.
The Iranian State has shut down Iran's capital for five days and has mobilized 110,000 policemen to "guarantee NAM security."

Bonbast Akhtar writes:
according to several reports there are several security check points in Tehran and a heavy security presence in Tehran.
It is like a non-declared curfew.
Security forces also check inside a lot of cars on their way for holidays on Chalous Road...Protesters in 2009 humiliated security forces and now they want to prove their authority and their importance.
Blogger Sayeh Azadi published a couple of photos from security forces and writes if 'EU and USA had listed Basijs on the terrorist list, this regime's beasts would not dare to intimidate people.'
Protesting against the regime?
Security is not the only topic Iranian bloggers talk about, some see the NAM summit as an opportunity to protest against the regime.
Sabzarman writes the presence of thousands of reporters and foreign guests is a rare opportunity for the Green Movement to make its voice heard in the world.
Among other things the blogger invites Iranians to write slogans in English with green spray on posters and walls close to the place where the summit is being held.
A group of students and political activists launched a Facebook campaign inviting Ban-Ki Moon, the United Nations General Secretary who is attending the NAM Summit, to visit detained opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi.
They published this open latter on the page:
Mr. Secretary General,
I am an Iranian citizen, and as a concerned Iranian I would like to invite you to visit Mr.Mir Hussein Mousavi during your stay in Tehran for the 16th Non-aligned Movement (NAM) summit.
Mr Mousavi, the opposition leader, was recently hospitalized due to heart complications after 15 months of house arrest...The democratic aspirations and the just demands of the Iranian people deserve the support of the international community, including the United Nations and the Secretary General.
Your position as the international authority entrusted with the responsibility for the protection and promotion of universal human rights accords you a special role.
We wish you success in discharging of this historical mission.
Azadi Esteghlal Edalat calls Iranians to become united with one voice and turn the NAM summit into a nightmare for the regime.
The blogger says:
NAM Summit created a golden opportunity to protest against the regime's crimes and support the Green Movement.
Hoping people flood the streets.
We should try our best for any protest action.
Estade Mordan says :
I do not understand why noone does anything.
This summit is a great opportunity to protest against the regime.
How long should we wait for somebody to do something for us.
Mousavi?
Karrubi?Reza Pahlavi ? or Morsi now...I as a member of the Green Movement call for a demonstration on Thursday, Agust 30,2012 from Imam Hossein to Azadi Square, as Mousavi called us to demonstrate three years ago.
Let's inform people via social media and all other means.
Zambia has had many expatriate national football team coaches.
The most well known of them is Croatian Ante Buselic, who took the country to the African Cup of Nations finals in 1974, but Frenchman, Herve Renard, who led the team in scooping the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 has swept all previous coaches off the perch.
In recognition of his success, the Zambian government recently accorded him permanent residence.
If he wants to become a permanent resident, the Zambian Government is willing to do that for him and that is why we have decided to give him a resident permit as a way of our appreciation for his contribution to football development in the country.

On one citizen media website the issue of granting permanent residency to a coach who once deserted Zambia for neighbouring Angola, has assumed political overtones.
Dual citizenship is controversial because most Zambians abroad want it included in the new constitution being drawn up, but Renard's status has effectively short-circuited the procedure.
Clearly misunderstanding what permanent residence and dual citizenship are, user canadian wrote:
Do these politicians check their records before they utter anything to the media?
This is a contractiction to what Sata has been saying about Dual Citizenship.
Zambia needs this clause to be implemented because the benefits outweigh what people without any idea of what they are talking about.
It is more than contracting a soccer coach when it comes to the Zambians abroad and the investments they will bring to the country.
A reader going by the name harold wrote:
Such privileges without procedures are worrying.Renard purely came here for employment as a coach, as many of other people have come, supposed all who are in Zambia do the best are we going to adopt them,
He was bought a car worthy 350m , with this poverty in Zambia should we worst money serving one person. we know government pay his rentals and all sorts of expenses.
Sometimes i fail to understand why we still separate ba zungu to Zambians.
Honestly we as youths we lost completely no direction what we learn and what is happening contrary to section in our brain act no foresigh
One reader, Jay Jay, raised the issue of a Catholic Priest who was deported from Zambia, apparently because he did not have legitimate papers:
You know what the law has an annoying habit, of coming back to bite you especially for those politicians who like cutting corners like buffoon Kambwili, remember this is the month in which a Rwandan priest was deported for not having a permit; if the priest’s Zambian members of his congregation in Chipata asked the PF gov’t why they didn’t waive that and let him stay; how would Kambwili answer that question
Expressing good wishes for Renard, Ndanji Wayaya wrote:
Well Done HR for the AFCON.
Please do it again in 2013.
With permits, citizenship etc you won our hearts stay in Zambia for as long as you want.
Just formalize your stay.
Forget about people`s comments.
Human beings will always complain.
Even when we won the AFCON 2012. They complained that it went into penalties.
It was just a lottery.
They wanted goals in regular play.
HR, HR.HR!!!!!!!!
The story also attracted attention on Twitter.

Two Northern youth groups on Wednesday criticized the Senate President, David Mark over his recent comments urging northern leaders to check the activities of the dreaded Boko Haram sect, Connected Africa reports.
Al Joresh is an outspoken critic of Saudi interior ministry's arbitrary detentions.
Moreover, she is the wife of a prisoner who has been detained for eight years without a trial.
She was planning to give away 500 gifts that contain a letter to raise awareness about the issue of arbitrary detention in Saudi Arabia.
At 5:11 AM (Saudi time), Al Joresh tweeted : Greetings, the police arrested me and my children.
Photo posted by Reema Al Joresh on Twitter as she tweeted: We have been arrested A hashtag was immediately started by Saudi Twitter users, who expressed their frustration.
Abdulaziz al-Shihri tweeted: "Secret police do not have either pre-Islam generosity, nor post-Islam ethics.
Oh God, let us rest - like the Egyptians - by not having them."
Mohammad al-Ogaimi added: She was followed by 800 people, now they are 2100.
With your oppression, their voice will go even further.
The comment refers to the number of followers Al Joresh had on Twitter.
At the time of writing this post, they have multiplied to around 3,500 and growing.
Screen shot showing Al Joresh's followers on Twitter When Reema was released, she wrote a series of tweets explaining what had happened: At 4:30am, I headed to the Eid mosque with my gifts.
About 100 meters away from my house, a car tried to stop us and they pointed machine guns at us.
My daughter Sara said to them: "You have stolen my father and now you are coming to steal us?".
They tried to silence my daughter Marya, who was crying.
They got my son Mo'ath and the driver out of the car then a policeman tried to take my phone, but Mo'ath told him to keep his hands off me they took the gifts and a policeman came in the front seat and told the driver to go to the General Intelligence office in Buraidah.
For an hour, they questioned me and tried to look for explosives within those boxes They told me to write down my confession.
In the blog Crónicas, Santos García Zapata explains the context around the Presidential decision to start peace talks with guerrilla groups.

This post is part of our special coverage #SudanRevolts.
The Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) launched a heavy-handed campaign in mid-June 2012, arresting thousands of protesters, activists, political party members and leaders and even law-abiding citizens from protest sites, universities, public places and in many cases people’s homes, following anti-regime protests.
However, once the protests calmed down over two months, the NISS began releasing detainees; August 17 marked the largest number of detainees released.
Among those released is Twitter activist Usamah Mohamed Ali who was arrested from the scene of a protest in Khartoum on June 22.
Usamah Mohamed Ali is a Sudanese Twitter activist who was arrested at a protest.
He has tweeted his prison experience following his release.
A month into Usamah’s arrest, Mimz wrote a blog post highlighting his detention.
A day after his release, he tweeted a mere two words but confirmed to his followers that he had been released:
@simsimt: I'm so grateful for all who campaigned for me!
A week later, Usamah wrote a series of short tweets narrating the conditions of his arrest.
He started off:
@simsimt: Without further detail for now, I was arrested by an #NISS agent in plainclothes who approached me while I was tweeting. #SudanRevolts
@simsimt: I remember very clearly that I was writing about the huge attempts made by #NISS to prevent any documentation of the protest. #SudanRevolts
Usamah explained that he refused to give away the password to his phone, provoking the anger of the NISS officers:
@simsimt: Locking my phone, which I've password-protected, later became the catalyst for much abuse, torture & interrogation I'd endured #SudanRevolts
Stating:
@simsimt: When taken to an #NISS pickup truck that was stationed by the protest area, I was ordered several times to unlock my phone. #SudanRevolts
@simsimt: I fiercely refused.
When they finally gave up on me, I was taken alone on a pickup, blindfolded, to #NISS premises in Bahri. #SudanRevolts
He then notes the emotional and physical torture he sustained while in detention:
@simsimt: At #NISS building, I endured almost 4 or 5 hours of verbal abuse, severe beating up and all kind of threats to unlock my phone #SudanRevolts
@simsimt: I was threatened w/ sexual assault/abuse numerous times during that day.
At one point, even by a top-rank #NISS officer. #SudanRevolts
Noting that:
@simsimt: I endured severe beating up on my head w/ a rock, 'cause my phone while in their possession, received a call from the U.S. #SudanRevolts
@simsimt: The torturer who had gone pretty mad was hysterically shouting "You're an agent, AGENT, AGENT!" while beating me up! #SudanRevolts
Explaining that NISS officers forcefully deprived him of sleep:
@simsimt: When again, they finally gave up on me, I was ordered by an officer, in front of me, to be deprived from sleeping. #SudanRevolts
Usamah concluded saying:
@simsimt: I hold #NISS accountable for everything I've endured.
I remember the faces of my torturers and abusive officers. #SudanRevolts

Monday's official confirmation of Ethiopia’s Prime Minster Meles Zenawi's death, sparked reactions among social media users in Tanzania, especially after tweets started appearing from what some thought was Zenawi's official Twitter account.
In all started when Zitto Zuberi Kabwe, a Member of Parliament from Tanzania, sent this tweet:
@zittokabwe: My condolences to the people of #Ethiopia following the death of Prime Minister #MelesZenawi Hope for a democratic developmental Abbysinia
Susan Mashibe ‏replied:
@iMashibe: @zittokabwe is this really true this time?
Cc @SwahiliStreet
And Swahili Street concluded:
@iMashibe announced on ETV.
It's official @zittokabwe
Chambi Chachage tweeted a blog post titled ‘Meles Zenawi's Farewell to Young African Leaders' from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on 16 November 2006, which was retweeted by others.
And then suddenly @PMMelesZenawi intervened, apparently 'tweeting after death' to Tanzania's Member of Parliament Zitto Kabwe:
@PMMelesZenawi: @zittokabwe please be better than I was.
Not fun up here I am preparing 2 pay for some of this http://www.ethiopianreview.net/index/?p=42267
Meles Zenawi ‏@PMMelesZenawi - tweeting after death.
Source: Twitter Screen Shot
This tweet to Zitto Kabwe, who has more than 29,000 followers, caused a stir, setting off speculation- was ‏@PMMelesZenawi hacked by opponents?
@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka this account seems not to be genuine of recent @pmmeleszenawi
Zitto Zuberi Kabwe concluded, and continued:
@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA tweets by @PMMelesZenawi not genuine.
Ignore them.
Account hacked by his opponents
Omar Ilyas backed it:
@omarilyas: This account is fake from the begining @PMMelesZenawi - a parody type like that one of @Julius_S_Malema @zittokabwe
However, the debate on Meles Zenawi’s legacy continued ranging from both admiration for Meles ability to ‘get the job done’ to the widespread awareness that Meles was not a democrat:
@Htunga: @zittokabwe Who is Meles seriously?I see Ethiopians starving n dying in lorries..I remember the shooting in 2010 too.
@zittokabwe: @Htunga were Tanzanians not starving and dying during Nyerere?
But we celebrate him because of his principles.
Meles the same’
@zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi regardless of his mistakes, #MelesZenawi remains a role model to me.
You have freedom to bring back #TheDerg or Isaias
The fake (supposedly hacked) @PMMelesZenawi Twitter account, which managed to set off the debate mentioned above, also raises the question of why many public figures and politicians in Africa haven’t had their Twitter accounts verified.
Reportedly, in many cases Twitter takes too long, or simply never respond to requests for verifying accounts.
Twitter is extremely popular in Tanzania as a tool for exchanging views and debate and also as a platform for breaking news.
Twitter, however, can easily be abused as in @PMMelesZenawi case, and can also cause confusion and suspicion with regard to authenticity and reliability of sources.
Other fake, hacked or parody African Twitter profiles at present are:@Hailemdesalegne, @Julius_S_Malema, @kabwezitto, @alfredmutua and @MwaiKibaki
Meles Zenawi was President of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995 and later became the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in 1995 following the general elections that year.

The Union Women and Child Development Ministry in India is considering a draft bill which, if passed by parliament, would make it legally compulsory for husbands to pay out a portion of their monthly income to their homemaker wives, for doing household chores.
As per the Ministry's proposal, a model is being framed which will allow for valuation of the work done by homemakers in economic terms and then recognition of this contribution to the economy by compensating homemakers for their labour.
The proposed law is expected to refer to homemakers as "home engineers".
Minister Krishna Tirath has said that this amount, which could be anywhere between 10-20% of the husband's monthly salary, should not be looked upon as salary for housework; rather it could be referred to as an honorarium or something similar.
While the Minister sees this as a step forward in women's empowerment, the proposal is being debated hotly, both offline as well as online.

Some feel that "measuring the value of unpaid work at home is conceptually correct and well worth trying", though making it mandatory for husbands to pay out a fixed percentage of their salaries in lieu of this work may be the wrong way forward.
Others wonder how it will be possible to put a 'price tag' on all the work that goes on within a home and how such a law would be implemented - given the various questions that are sure to come up in it's wake.
And questions are indeed being asked.
For example, LordRaj asks:
Are you suggesting an Employee / Employer relationship for the married couple?
Who is going to decide on the working hours and job description?
In Ground Report, which is an open news platform, D. Chaitanya outlines some further questions related to this issue that people (both men and women) appear to be hotly debating.
For example:
If in the place of wife, house-maid is discharging every day house-hold work, then how should the house-maid be treated?
Should not the house-maid be treated on par with the wife?
(In such cases) who are legitimately entitled for that 10 or 20% of amount?
If 10 or 20% salary is deposited on wife’s name, what about the maintenance money to wife, if she deserts the husband and files a maintenance case on husband?
Will this law create new financial skirmishes between wives and husbands?
Like 498-A of Penal Code, Maintenance laws, domestic violence laws, will this law also be misused by some wives?
Blogger Surya Murali too is wondering how the government proposes to implement a law such as this.
She says on her blog:
I am all for the empowerment of women, and also their financial independence... (but) my biggest question to these lawmakers is that how are they planning to implement the proposal?
If they go about doing it the way such that a husband shares a percentage of his income with his wife for her work, I don’t see how it makes the economic situation of the house any better or how it makes the woman independent and empowered.
The gross income remaining the same, the household economy is not changed.
Most responsible husbands, in my belief, would share the running costs of the household with their wives anyway… if that isn’t the case, then this sort of a scheme is not going to improve the husband-wife equation of those households.
At iDiva, Archana Jayakumar asks:
How does all of this not make her anything but a glorified servant?
Sunita at Supari.org agrees and calls this proposed Bill as "family breaking move" by the government.
Blogger LordRaj concludes that
Under the guise of 'development and welfare' of women, all you have been doing is promoting a bias against men. Men's rights groups tend to agree.
Let the government work out a method in which they evaluate the households economically and they give the housewives / homemakers an allowance. This totally skips the husband as a middleman and is a direct deal between the people who want the housewives to be empowered and the housewives.
InfoQueenBee agrees and adds:
This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees.
On February 23, 2012, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has come to a historic judgment, that Italy violated the European Convention on Human Rights by intercepting and sending back Eritrean and Somali migrants to Libya.

Unione Diritti Umani Blog explains the events:
The return involved a violation of Article 3 (anti-torture and inhumane treatment), Article 4 of Protocol 4 (collective expulsion of aliens), and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy).
The patrols that returned migrants to Libya were in breach of the non-refoulement principle.

The old Italian government, formed by Silvio Berlusconi's party, Popolo della libertà (People of Freedom), and Umberto Bossi's extreme right party, the Northern League, created a legal arsenal and took steps against immigration in Italy, which have been denounced on several occasions by civil society and the Catholic Church.
Italy has also been condemned on various instances for its anti-immigration policy, which is inconsistent with European treaties.
Gabriele Del Grande's blog fortresseurope.blogspot.com publishes information about Fortess Europe's activities for the defense of immigrant rights.
The association has produced a great number of reports, first hand accounts and films on refugee treatment in Italy as well as in other European countries.

Tanzania has experienced several crises since October 2010 general elections, including some which have resulted in violence and death.
Blogger Dunia Duara made a (not complete) list of events fuelled by different kinds of crises or conflicts, which recently have caused serious problems in Tanzania:
2011 January: CHADEMA lead demonstration in Arusha conflicts with police
2011 February: Explosions in Gongo La Mboto
2011 July: clash with police in Mwanza
2011 September: MV Spicelander sinks between Zanzibar and Pemba
2011 December: Dar es Salaam floods
2012 February: Police killings in Songea
2012 April: Land issues and bi-elections in Arumeru
2012 May: Riots in Zanzibar related to UAMSHO
2012 June: Doctors' strike (back in February and onwards) and the abduction of Dr Ulimboka.
2012 July: A ferry on its way from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar sinks.
2012 July: Riots in Zanzibar related to UAMSHO, and mourning of the dead from the ferry accident.
Police brutality in Tanzania.

Most recently, on September 2, 2012, Tanzanian journalist Daudi Mwangosi was killed by a tear gas canister in Nyololo Village in Mufindi South (Iringa Region) in Southern Tanzania.
The Citizen was amongst the first of the Tanzanian dailies to report about the incident, describing how police used tear gas to disperse a group of CHADEMA (opposition party) supporters:
Mr Mwangosi becomes the second person to be killed in conflicts pitting the Police Force and the opposition party in the space of two weeks.
On August 27, one Ally Zona was killed in Morogoro as police dispersed Chadema supporters who were gearing up for a demonstrations.
Pictures of the incident in Nyololo Village quickly circulated on social media sites.
The blog Wawuti.com has collected a comprehensive selection (see also photo above).
The incident has been covered intensively and many different newspapers, in Kiswahili and English as well as international, have commented extensively.
Social media users have expressed anger and shock over what appears to be a senseless and very violent killing.
People have expressed shock about both the killing and the police brutality.
Daraja blog was quick to produce a factual list of 'key sources', including links to Tanzania's Media Council's statement and the World Association of Press Council's statement, but Daraja also did a thorough analysis - stating in the headline that "a line has been crossed".
First, an overview of what happened:
They tell us that Mwangosi was in Nyololo together with several other journalists to report on Chadema opening an office in the village, in defiance of police orders against political activities during the census period.
There was a heavy police presence in the village.
Another journalist, Godfrey Mushi of Nipashe, was apprehended by the police, and Mwangosi went to find out why.
A group of police officers then turned on Mwangosi, beating him badly for several minutes.
The reports tell us that Regional Police Commander, Michael Kamuhanda, was nearby in a stationary vehicle, and was informed that the man the police were beating was a journalist.
However, he took no steps to stop this, and a few minutes later a tear gas cannister was shot into Mwangosi's stomach from point blank range.
Mwangosi died instantly, and a police officer was injured.
Journalists demonstrate in Dar es Salaam on September 10 against the police violence which caused Daudi Mwangosi's death.

Daraja continues:
There is no suggestion that Daud was doing anything improper.
He was there as a journalist, with a legitimate right to be there and to report on Chadema's activities and the police's response.
He was not there as a Chadema supporter at a rally, so he was not even breaching the police ban on political activities during the census period.
(Though even if a Chadema activist who had been killed in this way, the police's actions would still have been disproportionate and wrong.)
Daraja raises serious questions:
Will the responsible police be held to account for this?
And what will be the effect on the media?
The answers are far from given.
Tanzanian media professionals have expressed their sympathy with their former colleague when they demonstrated in Dar es Salaam on September 10, against the most recent police violence.
Tanzania's reputation as a peaceful country is indeed becoming increasingly questionable with these recent events.
Only few days before the opening of GV2012 in Nairobi, Kenya experienced bloody blasts and kidnapping in Mombasa and in the town of Garissa.
A blast hit a nightclub on 24 June killing 3 people, just a day after the US embassy warned Kenyan authorities of an imminent attack in the city.
The crowd had gathered at the club to watch the Euro 2012 quarter-final between England and Italy.
Beegeagle quotes an eyewitness:
“I had just arrived and was having a drink as I waited for the football match to begin, then I heard an explosion, and another and another. I went down on my belly.
Then I saw a car speed off and bodies lying all over,” said Muthoni.
On 1 July, in the Kenyan town of Garissa masked attackers killed 17 people and wounded 45 in a gun and grenades attacks on two churches.
This town is being used by Kenyan army as a base for operations against al-Qaida-linked insurgents in Somalia.
In a post reproduced on Sahara Reporters, James Macharia noted
Although a majority of Kenyans are Christian, Garissa is more heavily Muslim.
The town of around 150,000, a market centre for the trade in camels, donkeys, goats and cattle, is largely populated by ethnic Somalis.

Francis Njuguna wrote on CatholicPhilly:
The simultaneous attacks on Our Lady of Consolation Cathedral and the Protestant Africa Inland Church in the northern town of Garissa were the most recent in a series of incidents since Kenyan troops were sent into Somalia in October to crush al-Shabaab militants.
In another bloody attack at the Dabaab Refugee Camp, four foreign aid workers from Canada, Norway, the Philippines and Pakistan were seized and their Kenyan driver killed by suspected Al-Shabaab militants.
Combined actions by Somali national army and Kenyan military them rescued after 3 days of captivity.
Protests and online reactions have been furious, condemning the attacks, calling for national unity online and organizing actions to counter future attacks.
An article on the website nation.co.ke of the main Kenya newspaper generated many comments from netizens:
Ahmed Mohamed wrote:
This is a dark day for Kenya.
These cowards want to create civil war; they have already destroyed their own country by this means.
Let’s not allow them to insight hate between us.
Muslims and Christians have been living side by side for centuries with harmony and we will live like this forever.
Their coward act will not have effect to our nation.
For Michelline Ntara Kenya government should help refugee camps in Kenya:
.... However, its the high time Kenya evaluated her hospitality principles.
The KDF have helped to restore peace in many areas inside Somalia.
The refugee camps in Kenya Somalia border should now be closed and those people helped to go back to their country.
Most probably, these attackers are performing their cowardly acts from those camps and then crawl back there afterwards.
Even if our security forces try their best to get these criminals, its hard to fight an enemy within.

Dear Nation,it's time we all start calling this attacks for what they are......Terrorist attacks.
By calling them church attacks,it could mean just about anything while we all know that some radical elements linked to Alshabab is behind this. kenyans are paying a high price over years of ignorance...we all knew that there were radical elements in our country and we chose to stay silent.....but we can no longer continue with this ostrich strategy.
The first step is for us to call this attacks for what they are Terrorist attacks
Another reader, Mohamed Abdi asked:
10.20 Am? that was broad daylight.
Something is not adding up here, where was the security personnel, the Army, the Police, the Ap's?
How can two or three gunmen do such act with impunity at 10.Am when Garissa has thousands of security personell?
It was much easier to cordon the area and flash out those culprits.
Once again the security personnel failed the innocent Kenyans who pay them their hard earned taxes. its really shame!
Mazzaroth Darkman wrote:
NSIS must tell Kenyans who is throwing grenades into churches and crusades, if it is a shadowy element of Kenya's politics we want to know - if it is Al shabab then Military Intelligence have to wake up, deploy undercover Agents in the same dark corners from Kismayu to Eastleigh and terminate with extreme prejudice...let us stop playing nice.
This was never going to be a regular military campaign
A Muslim NGO offered to help secure churches:
Further more, it is even our duty as Muslims to guard and protect all innocent life, including those in Churches.
We implore on brothers to spread our messages and encourage a resistance among us Muslims who will apprehend those who claim to be Muslims but are simply workers of the devil, and perpetrate these atrocities.
The information was reproduced by the bog My Joy Online, receiving a comment from John Mensah, who said :
Talk about peaceful co-existence.
This should be a model for all.
Even the intent is praise worthy.
However, the perpetrators of these acts of terror seem not to be paying much attention to these reactions:
Kenyan police has on Thursday reportedly arrested a man with two grenades as he tried to sneak into an Agricultural Show Ground in Nakuru, just moments before Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki arrived at the scene.
In the meantime, investigations are continuing and eighty-three people have been arrested in a massive security swoop launched after Sunday's twin attacks in Garissa churches.
On 29 August, 2012, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Chairman Sam Nyamweya announced that former French footballer and coach Henri Michel has been appointed national team coach.
After a string of bad results from the national team and missing out on two consecutive Africa Cup of Nations, as well as failing to reach the finals of regional football tournaments, FKF officials are feeling the pressure to find a way to get results.
Bloggers in Kenya had their own views about Henri Michel's appointment.
Chenga Funga states this in his post 'The Rule of Knowns':
A 3 way dilemma.
That’s what has led FKF to Henri.
Michel Simply put, would you rather the known-known, known unknown or unknown unknowns?
After witnessing the Harambee stars struggle to strike lustre in the beautiful game, stakeholders have been touting names foreign to the Kenyan tongue for the national team’s top job.
The dilemma therein.
Others have been tried and tested in the recent past, and not many have impressed: Francis Kimanzi, “Ghost” Mulee, Antoine Hey and Zico, didn’t quite cut it.
So Sam Nyamweya and Football Kenya Federation opted to chance with the known-unknowns, Raymond Domenech (yes, him), Claude Leroy, Oto Pfister, Adel Amrouche and Frenchman Michel from a more extensive shortlist.
Many boast noteworthy success under their managerial careers and therefore felt equal to the task.
Put in mind our football team is a wild card.
Has been for a while now.
In a minute way, VERY MINUTE, our position is similar to England’s, currently bossed by Roy Hodgson. Bags of potential, no actual results.
Admittedly, we should be thankful for the national coaches we have had, but life goes on, and it has, with Frenchman Henri Michel. Our known unknown.
MutuaMaundu's blog also played down the expectations put on Monsieur Michel:
The whole country has almost gone hysterical about it.
To many, Henri Michel is the much-needed messiah to the Kenyan soccer that has literally seen the worst.
The French-man may have unrivalled feathers to his cap, but as a nation that has suffered heartbreaks and anguish due to an under-performing national team, let us tone down our expectations.
It will be prudent not to expect too much.
Frenchman Henri Michel, a reputed tactician has enjoyed great success at the game’s pinnacle.
As a player and coach, he led the Les Bleus, France’s national team, to third place in Mexico 1986 and became a household name in Morocco, after guiding the Atlas Lions to France 1998 World Cup.
He went on to steer the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia to the 2002 World Cup in Japan/ Korea and was Ivory Coast’s coach during the 2006 World Cup in Germany.
However, bearing in mind that football administration has been deplorable, laden with corruption and all manner of ills, it will be wise not to expect too much from the new Stars tactician.
There are no proper structures to develop and nature talent in readiness for national duty.
The Kenyan premier league had to form its own independent body in 2003, Kenya Premier League, KPL.
This was after the then Kenya Football Federation, KFF almost threw the game to the dogs.
Despite the newly elected Football Kenya Federation, FKF, there is no respite in sight for Kenyan soccer.
Power games have almost washed away the hope that that had engulfed the Kenyan football fraternity.
Only the Late Reinhardt Fabisch had a successful tenure at the helm of the national team, besides renowned German Bernard Zgoll in the 80s.
Apart from the two, foreigners Bernard Lama of France and German Antoine Hey had short, trouble-laden tenures.
They consequently left acrimoniously.
These were all precipitated by unfulfilled promises by the football administrators.
These incidents should have taught us not to over- blow with optimism with regard to Michel’s appointment.
We should trend carefully and give the Frenchman the necessary support to produce the desired results.
But we ought to ask ourselves if there are any long-term measures to get Kenyan soccer on track.
Henri Michel’s appointment and success if any will only be short-term, the long walk awaits us.
Good people and football- loving Kenyans, great expectations may make us frustrated and bitter if the football does not change for the better under Monsieur Le Bon!
AllTimesNews had earlier predicted Henri Michel's appointment and also posted his successes and previous postings:
In Summary
Ex-France tactician, to be unveiled on Tuesday, seen as Kenya’s vehicle to football success 64-year-old Michel beat other top international coaches, among them Adel Amrouche, Tom Saintfiet and Raymond Domenech, to the job The Frenchman knows the rugged terrain of African football, having been in the continent for two decades since he first coached Cameroon in 1994
Former France coach Henri Michel will next week be named coach of the national football team, Harambee Stars.
Football Kenya Federation (FKF) chairman Sam Nyamweya confirmed to theNation on Tuesday that Michel has accepted to take over the reins at the national team and will be unveiled by Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
Michel, who was in the country last month for negotiations, beat more than 60 foreign coaches who had applied for the position which became vacant after Francis Kimanzi was redeployed to become the technical director at FKF.
This appointment will prompt various views and Michel's job is full on from the word go.
The dismal performance that Kenya's national football team, Harambee Stars, has shown over the past four years is something the country's football fans hope to put behind them.With 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and 2014 World Cup pre-qualifiers coming up soon, Kenyan football authorities wait to see see what difference Henri Michel may make.
Many innovative solutions are being proposed to help tackle the spread of counterfeit drugs in developing countries.
Technological innovations to track counterfeit drugs
Ashifi Gogo from Ghana is an entrepreneur with an innovative solution involving mobile phones.
In simplified terms, the idea is to place a scratch-off label on the products; the label contains a unique code, which the consumer sends via SMS and then receives a reply as to whether the product is authentic or not.
In this TEDx Boston talk, Ashifi Gogo explains how his solution works by combining cell phones, community, and the cooperation of governments and pharmaceutical companies:
After the Duo-Cotecxin incident in Kenya, Holley-Cotec, the company that manufactures the antimalarial, introduced a new technology to make the tablets tamper-proof. James Nyikal, director of Medical Services in Kenya explains :
New packets of the drugs will have three-dimensional hologram seals and other features to indicate the drugs are authentic.
"Is this drug real or counterfeit?

Inspectors scrutinize the packages, because they need to be certain that an intention exists to deceive the consumer.
“If you just have the tablets or the capsules, even if they have no active ingredient, it still could have been an innocent mistake in the factory.
Some of the packaging errors on counterfeit drugs are quite comical.
On one, the expiry date was before the manufacturing date, so we knew something wasn’t quite right!”
He also mentions the challenges of screening in poor settings:
Challenges in developing countries mean that investigators have to think creatively and come up with effective analytical techniques that cost pennies and are robust.
“We found out that many of the fake artesunates, posing as a particular brand produced in China, contained calcium carbonate," says Green .
Since the authentic brand did not contain calcium carbonate, he and his colleagues were able to distinguish counterfeits from the genuine tablets by adding vinegar to bits of the tablets.
A growing challenge for the developing world
More important than their economic impact, counterfeit medicines pose a significant global public health problem.
Not only do they endanger the lives and the well-being of patients, they also undermine confidence in healthcare systems and health professionals.
The following chart by the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI) details the geographical distribution of confirmed counterfeiting incidents in 2011; the issue is increasingly challenging to tackle for the developing world because of the growing volume of fake drugs and the required infrastructure.
Total counterfeit drug incidents by year.
Graph by PSI (available in public domain).
To the point, PSI notes:
The regions that are more frequently linked to incidents are not necessarily those with weak enforcement and inspection programs.
Rather, countries in these regions are effectively identifying pharmaceutical crime through law enforcement activity and inspections by drug regulatory agencies.
Despite the innovation mentioned earlier, detecting counterfeit drugs is still a very difficult task and requires both advanced technology and the capacity to strictly enforce international regulations.
For instance, many defective and counterfeit antimalarials were reported in developing countries this year but only after patients had been treated.
In 2012, a study showed that one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.
In 2007, the Ministry of Health in Kenya issued a warning about counterfeit antimalarial medication Duo-Cotecxin being sold in Nairobi and how to detect it.
Lawrence Evans, a researcher who has conducted a study in Guyana and Suriname on the quality of antimalarial drugs says:
Besides the presence of medicines not included in the World Health Organization malaria treatment guidelines, the ease with which medications were procured without accurate diagnosis poses another major risk to patients' safety. In addition, this could have serious implications for the development of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium parasites, particularly Falciparum, as novel treatments are not foreseeable in the near future.
“New malaria drugs and a vaccine are urgently needed in Africa, where malaria has grown resistant to the cheapest and most widely-used treatments. As several promising new drugs and vaccines move through the research pipeline, there is a need to build African capacity to conduct large-scale clinical trials of these drugs and vaccines over the next decade,” said Prof Binka .
Enrique Aranda Ochoa is not your average Mexican writer: Enrique was arrested in 1997 and convicted of kidnapping with a sentence of 50 years in prison.
However, this has not stopped this renowned psychologist from pursuing his passion for literature.
Enrique has been awarded several national literature prizes and has already written six novels.
Today he focuses on the mysteries of the Mayans in his book "El fin de los dias" (The end of our time) , which is available for purchase online in an electronic format.
Blogger Gabriela Gutierrez M. from Animal Político describes the writer's activities in jail:
Eager to talk, topics rush between his words.
He can start talking about the sun, for example, and he might end up talking about yoga, a discipline that he teaches in prison.
A conversation with him is equivalent to visiting a library, after which you end up with a list of outstanding literature for reading.
His final recommendation was the Cuban Joaquin Maria Machado de Assis.

Gabriela continues her blog post mentioning the awards Enrique has won through his texts written directly from jail:
Right from prison, Enrique Aranda has been awarded the National Poetry Prize "Salvador Diaz Miron" (1998, 2001 and 2008) by Conaculta-INBA three times.
He also won the National Short Story Prize José Revueltas, awarded by those institutions, twice (2003 and 2008).
It was the Cultural Institute of Mexico City, now Ministry of Culture, who provided nearly 800 books : "When I called them, at first thought it was an official.
When I told them I was a prisoner they were excited", he says.
The mission of this project was to give inmates "a ticket for a tour of the outside world they longed for."
The website of Mexican magazine Proceso published an article on his case where they mention the irregularities of his indictment for kidnapping:
Enrique always suspected that his arrest was due to his political activities in public forums, for his solidarity with social causes, such as the zapatista cause, and for participating as an activist against NAFTA.
The case was also reported by Amnesty International in its 2003 report: Unfair trials: torture in the administration of justice (AI Index: AMR 41/007/2003/), the president of the PEN Club, Eugene Schoulgin, visited him in 2006; also the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights defends them, and the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District (Mexico City) issued a Recommendation 12/02 due to torture and violation of his legal guarantees.
Enrique Aranda Ochoa plans to take his case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
An 11-year old Christian girl, Rimsha Masih has been accused of blasphemy and has been remanded for 14 days to a juvenile prison in the twin city of the Pakistan capital, Rawalpindi.
There are conflicting reports on whether she has Downs Syndrome or not.
Rimsha is accused of burning pages of Noorani Qaida, an Arabic learning lesson for beginners, and putting them in a plastic bag.
The incident happened on August 16, 2012 in the slum Meherabadi in G-12, Islamabad where she lives with her family.
A local police station filed a First Information Report (FIR) after a neighbor made a formal complaint against her.
The blasphemy offence comes under Article 295-B of the Pakistan Penal Code and the offender can get life imprisonment or a death sentence.
The news was taken up by a website ‘Christians in Pakistan’ on August 18.
The report became big news on Pakistan's mainstream media five days later on August 22.
Prior to her arrest some locals of the area blocked a main highway in the capital.
The mob apparently wanted to do the justice themselves. Last month a mob burnt a mentally unstable man in Bahwalpur; the man was also accused of blasphemy.
Pakistan's Minister for National Harmony, Dr. Paul Bhatti, said in an interview to BBC world service that 600 Christians have fled their homes in Islamabad after the 11-year old was arrested for blasphemy.
The Christians are afraid and are hiding; the memories of 2009 Gojra attack are still fresh in their minds when a Muslim mob burnt houses of Christians and police didn’t come to help them.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the Gojra riots were pre-planned and the local administration was involved.
Anthony Permal a Pakistani Christian based in the UAE brought tweeter users attention to this story:
‏@anthonypermal: Confirmed- Police in #Pakistan have arrested an 11 year old Christian girl suffering from Downs Syndrome for blasphemy.
Soon an online petition was circulated for asylum of Rimsha:
@MohsinSayeed (Mohsin Sayeed): Raise your voice to save lives of Rifta&her family.
Escape to a secular country is the only option.
They will kill her: http://www.change.org/petitions/high-commissions-and-diplomats-of-secular-western-nations-asylum-to-the-family-of-11-year-old-christian-girl-accused-of-blasphemy# …
The online petition requests the secular western countries to provide asylum of Rimsha’s family:
Pakistanis of good conscious are signing this petition because the State of Pakistan even failed to protect their own Governor who spoke out against the draconian blasphemy law, where mere accusation of blasphemy will ensure Jail and perhaps worse for the accused.
There is another petition that is calling on Pakistan’s Minister of Human Rights and the government to protect and release Rimsha Masih.
Meanwhile, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari called on officials to explain the situation to him.
The Pakistani Ambassador to the USA tweets:
‏@sherryrehman: Pres Zardari has taken serious note of reports of the arrest of a minor Christian girl on the charges of blasphemy & called for a report.
Amnesty International urges Pakistan to reform Blasphemy laws:
‏@amnesty (Amnesty International): #Pakistan must ensure safety of Christian girl arrested for 'blasphemy' whose life is at risk http://owl.li/d9aPc
France’s foreign ministry has called the Pakistani authorities to free the young girl.
Irshad Manji, Muslim Feminist and author of 'Allah, Liberty and Love' condemned Pakistan’s blasphemy law.
‏@IrshadManji: My @RFI_English interview about #Pakistan's blasphemy law, which has led 2 jailing of #Christian girl named #Rimsha:
The situation is condemned by Pakistani Human Rights campaigners and activists and few politicians on twitter.
‏@Ali_Abbas_Zaidi (Syed Ali Abbas Zaidi): The most tragic short story to have been written about misuse of #blasphemy law in Pakistan: "She was just 11 years old." ‏@MaheenAkhtar (Maheen Akhtar): Where the hell is suo motto of Cheif Justice Pakistan, is he sleeping.....Oh wait is this "Blasphemy"
‏@beenasarwar (Beena Sarwar): The important issue in accusations of 'blasphemy' is that of intent, niyat, of the accused.
That's something the accusers ignore. #Pakistan
Ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf condemned the incident.
Leader of PTI Imran Khan tweets.
@ImranKhanPTI: Shameful!
Sending an 11yr old girl to prison is against the very spirit of Islam which is all about being Just and Compassionate.1/2
‏@SundasHoorain: @CMShehbaz Still waiting for action & condemnation from PML-N on an 11yr old getting accused of blasphemy, beaten & arrested #FreeRimsha
All other political parties are afraid of talking about this issue.
It is considered sensitive.
However no one from Pakistan demands to repeal this law.
@anthonypermal: We can't repeal blasphemy law.
A) mobs would go on vigilante sprees with no qualms & b) cops couldn't stop open shia killing, how this?
On December 20, 2010, the Council of Islamic Ideology also announced proposed amendments to the law to prevent its misuse.
But religious parties in the house -Jamat-i- Islami, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Pakistan, and Sunni Tehreek and others threatened a mass protest.
Sherry Rehman later received death threats and was confined to her house.
In January 2011, the Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer a vocal critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, was publicly gunned down by his own guard, Mumtaz Qadri for his beliefs.
Incidentally Qadri is also in Adiala jail where Rimsha has been sent.
When Qadri was on his way to trial, his supporters showered him with rose petals.
The Sunni Tehreek party rally in favor of Mumtaz Qadri, the killer of Salman Taseer, and they demand his release in Hyderabad, Pakistan.

Malik Siraj Akbar in his blog for Huffington Post says that discriminatory laws deepens religious intolerance in Pakistani society:
Despite such frequent unpleasant events, Pakistan has made almost no progress in reforming its deeply flawed and discriminatory law involving blasphemy.
Such laws, on the one hand, discriminate against religious minorities and, on the other hand, further deepen religious intolerance and fanaticism in Pakistani society. They provide the murderers a license to kill people and easily get away with such heinous crimes in the name of religion.
Mehdi Hasan in his blog writes:
Personally, I've never quite understood why so many of my co-religionists are so keen to kill or maim those who 'insult' Islam, Prophet Muhammad or the Quran.
What is behind such rage and, dare I add, insecurity?
Is their God so weak, so sensitive, so precious, that He cannot withstand any rejection?
Protests are growing in the Palestinian territories, especially in the major cities of the West Bank: Hebron, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Nablus.
Demonstrators are expressing their anger with the Palestinian Authority, with the high cost of living, and the high rate of unemployment among Palestinian youth.
The protests started after the Palestinian Authority declared an increase of about 8% in fuel and petrol prices in the West Bank, starting from the beginning of September.
There was therefore a rapid rise in prices, without any significant increase in salaries or wages in the Palestinian territories.
Aban Idrees witnessed a protest in Hebron and tweeted : In Hebron the traffic is in absolute paralysis after the protests against the high cost of living demanding the government of Fayyad to resign.
Cars are barely moving in the street
Blogger Ola Al Tamimi also tweeted from Hebron : Ain Sarah, the biggest street in Hebron, is now blocked by trucks and people.
Some protests are beginning to move towards the National Security headquarters and the municipality building
Ola added : This is the first time a protest has taken place in Hebron when nobody was beaten by the Preventive Security Services
Hafez Omar, a Palestinian activist and artist, tweeted : This is the first time since 1936 that the Palestinians have protested for the sake of the cost of living!
Shame on whoever wants us to forget Palestine and run after a loaf of bread...
Twitter was also flooded with funny slogans by Palestinian protesters.
Rana Baker tweeted : One of the best banners raised today in Palestine against Fayyad's government and the high prices: "Nowadays when I go to the market, I just 'like' and go home!"
Another banner was captured by Lamees Suradi:
The nicest comment from Nablus: "If you are not standing with the poor then you are not standing with the prisoners either; please explain to us why are you still in power!"
Twitter user iPalestine tweeted about an attempted self-immolation by a man called Hussein Qahwaji : A citizen poured gasoline on his body and that of his 5-year-old daughter and tried to set himself on fire, but others stopped him from doing so by force.
Some reports said that Qahwaji's daughter suffers from cancer, and is actually being treated in Jordan, and that he could not afford to visit her.
It wasn't the first case of a Palestinian using self-immolation as a protest.
On September 2, 17-year-old Ehab Abu al-Nada died in Gaza after he set himself on fire, maybe in imitation of the Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi.
Ehab Abu al-Nada had left school and used to work for 13 hours a day for just 30 shekels (about US$ 7.4) in order to help his father with family expenses.
The incident gained a lot of attention, especially after a photo was published of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh with Ihab's father; Haniyeh visited to give him "emergency aid" of US$ 2,000 after Ehab's death.
Many wonder if this new movement will continue, and whether it could spread to other towns and cities.
John Lyndon asked:
@johnlyndon1: Self immolation in Gaza; Fayyad effigy burning in Hebron; protests in major West Bank cities.
Is spring arriving late in #Palestine?
This post is part of our special coverage London 2012 Olympics.
From August 29 until September 12, 2012, 4,200 athletes from 166 countries will take part in the 14th edition of the Paralympic Games in London and will compete in twenty disciplines.
The organizers needed 15 days after the London 2012 Olympics to rearrange and make infrastructures accessible.
Charles El Meliani on JOL press writes that a record number of tickets were sold for these games:
Proscovia Alengot Oromait has become Africa's youngest Member of Paliament (MP) at the age of 19, after she won the Usuk county election with 11,059 votes.
The outspoken youngster replaces her father who died earlier this year.
Alengot is a member of National Resistance Movement, headed by President Yoweri Museveni.
Other people who stood for the post included, Charles Ojok Oleny with 5,329 votes, Charles Okure from FDC with 2,725 votes and Cecilia Anyakoit of UPC with 554 votes.
Honourable Alengot Oromait.

Many people have come out to congratulate her, whilst some are saying she will not survive her term in parliament because of her age and limited experience.
Some people believe this is the beginning of change in Africa and its time to get rid of the overly old leaders and allow young people to take the continent forward.
Hon. Alengot's area faces challenges of clean water, electricity and poor roads among others.
For now the people of Usuk have their hopes pinned on the 19 year-old MP.
Hopefully, she will be in position to represent her area and develop it.

Joy Doreen Biira requests someone to teach Ms Alomait the basics she needs to learn as an MP:
@JoyDoreenBiira: Alengot Oromait, 19 years old is now a MP in Uganda....
Very Good.
But can someone "home-school" her on the basics she needs to know else...
Commenting on New Vision website, Agambagye Frank thinks its good that she was elected and believes this is how democracy should be:
thats why democracy is good pple voted her
lakodo urges Hon Aromait not to leave her boyfriend, now that she has got more money and has a lot of opportunities to get a rich boyfriend:
Hon Prossy , plse dont forget ur little 19 yr old boy friend who used to buy for u chapatis, he kind of also helped u in a way, and remember to take haert not to be scared of some MPs like Moses Ali who snores like the whole roof of parliament is coming down.
Commenting on a story on the Monitor website, nkuutu urges advises the MP to concentrate on her studies, as the MP seat can be lost at anytime and she may have to look for a job:
I just have one piece of advice for the hon MP: Don't worry, be happy.
This might be the only time in your life to shine!
Come next elections ....who knows.
Don't forget your day job ...I mean your studies.
No one will give you a job with a CV with "ex-MP but no qualification".
Anyone can be an MP, but not everyone is educated.
Congrats!!
ProWoman thinks people are treating Ms Alengot like a baby.
She goes on to tell them to let her think for herself because she is an adult:
Jing Gao from Ministry of Tofu explains how the Fujian government extended its black hand to Yunnan to stop the publication of a news story that exposes the corruption of a Fujian government official.
S.B comments on the start of health workers' indefinite strike in Abidjan.
On Connection Ivorienne, he states that:
From the total no-fees for healthcare initiated by the state of Côte d'Ivoire after the end of the post-electoral crisis to free selected healthcare services, employees of certain health institutions have yet to receive their salary in a regular manner.
What's worse is that their manager did not get any payments for the past 16 months.
Le Potentiel writes that French president Hollande's assessment of Human Rights violations in DR of Congo were not taken lightly by the Congolese government as the Francophone Summit is set to take place in Kinshasa, DRC.
The two governments seem to be at odds on the death of Human right activist Chebeya, the national electoral commission and the need for a human rights committee.
Betty Mould Iddrisu, jurist and Minister of Justice of Ghana, writes on pambazuka.org:
To reach the upper level is rare, and once you have arrived there, you still have to face hostility and doubts about your abilities, because you are a woman.
A woman at the top works harder than a man to prove her skills, and yet she still must face entrenched prejudices and hostility, in her role as manager and leader, in a work environment largely dominated by males.

At least 7 civilians were killed, up to 32 were injured, and 35 were intoxicated on October 4, 2012, when combined armed forces violently removed demonstrators from Cuatro Caminos ("four roads"), a well-known intersection of roads that go to Quetzaltenango, Guatemala City, Huehuetenango and Totonicapán.
Demonstrators blocked the road to protest the rising price of electricity in the area.
They also demand a dialogue with the government to discuss their objections to the education and constitutional reforms proposed by President Otto Pérez Molina.
The demonstrators were representatives from indigenous communities from Totonicapan, an exceptional, mostly indigenous (90%) community in the Guatemalan highlands.
While demonstrations are common in the area, the number of persons killed and injured is highly unusual.
There is evidence that members of the Guatemalan Army were carrying guns, although the Minister of Interior has denied it, arguing that the peasants killed each other, as Mario Rodríguez explains in his blog post "Declarations full of cynicism" .

Hard working and one of the most active environmentalist communities, the people in Totonicapán are dedicated to preserving the forest and their water sources, as described by Cultural Survival:
The forest has been preserved for generations, thanks to the work of people who have lived in harmony with the world around them, by means of ancestral knowledge of resource management and active participation of each community.
For such level of care and management you need a well-organized community and active leaders seeking common good.
Totonicapán is one of the few territories where indigenous authorities exercise power, divided in 48 cantons, lead by community mayors and a President who serves as the mediator in case of conflicts and as the spokesperson when it is necessary to dialogue beyond the community.
In 2011, for the first time in history, a single woman, law student María del Carmen Tacam, was elected President of the Cantons in Totonicapán.
She explained in an interview that she follows the instructions of the consensus of all 48 local authorities.
As reported by Voces Mayas , María del Carmen explained that while appealing to refrain from violent measures, the indigenous communities blocked the Cuatro Caminos intersection because the government and the corporations did not respond to their clear demands.
She also mentioned that the local hospital collapsed due to the number of people injured. The Constitutional Reform proposed by the President, which they disapprove.
Education reform, as they oppose the modifications to the requirements to become a school teacher. Rising cost of electricity because the company did not stick to their commitments.
The community wants to keep the dialogue open and is waiting for clear responses from the government of Pérez Molina.
During the previous government, the dialogue between the government and the communities was mediated by the Ombudsman, as documents show, but this time he was denied access.

Furthermore, as early as March 2012, different voices raised their concerns about the rapidly growing size and role of the military in Guatemala and the presence of so-called "mega projects" like the Goldcorp mine.
Cascadia solidaria comments about the increased militarized actions against civilians:
The strategic use of roadblocks by indigenous and campesino organizations as form of political pressure and re-vindication is harshly contested by the state and powerful economic actors, especially the business lobby CACIF*, which has campaigned for the prohibition and repression of blockades as violations of the right to freedom of movement.
The Pérez Molina administration has previously used violence to break up roadblocks and occupations by students, teachers, and parents protesting exclusionary education reforms; if today’s deaths are confirmed to be the responsibility of security forces, it will mark the first clear instance of mortal government repression against civilian protest under Mano Dura.
While community leaders have called for investigation of the deaths, if the administration follows the blueprint established by its response to social conflict and protest in Barillas, Huehuetenango, repressive measures such as arrests of protest leaders or declaration of a state of exception could be implemented instead.
In an official statement, the President -who is the maximum authority and Commander in Chief of the Guatemalan Army- indicated that he has ordered an investigation into the violence and deaths from October 4.
In the meantime, the communities are waiting for dialogue and responses.

The Atomic Power Project in Koodankulam in the Tirunelveli district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has started operations last month amidst protests (see Global Voices report).
The plant has started generating electricity but the situation is becoming worse as arrests are still being carried out and protesters remain in jail.
This week also marks a call for a fortnight of protests across India in solidarity with people’s struggle against the Nuclear Plant.
On Sunday, 14th of October, the revolutionary Democratic Front issued a statement condemning the illegal detention and, arrest on the members of an all-Indian fact finding team to Koodankulam nuclear plant in Tamil Nadu.
The team was detained at Nanguneri on the 12th of October, 20 km away from Koodankulam on charges of “illegal assembly”.
After a daylong detention, the police charged them under different sections of Criminal Law Amendment Act.
The team members have been taken to Palayamkottai prison.
According to Sanhati:
“The people of Koodankulam have been bravely fighting against the nuclear power plant which has come up in their homes and hearths for months now.
The government instead of responding to their just demands and concerns for the immense security risk and the environmental hazard that this plant can cause on the surrounding area, has responded with the most cruel repression on the protesting masses.
Their attempt to restrict and repress this fact-finding team also clearly shows how they do not want the people to speak out or even knows about the conditions in Koodankulam or about the valiant movement the people are fighting there.
The government is simply trying to intimidate and throttle all voices of solidarity and support to the people fighting against Koodankulam nuclear plant.
Protesters across the nation send in their signatures to kudankulam, India, in solidarity with the anti nuclear campaign.

Also on Sunday, the Socialist Janata (Democratic) Party in Kerala voiced support to people agitating against the proposed nuclear project at Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu.
Women from the protests are still in prison.
Anitha S. writes about them in a post titled 'Koodankulam women from prison: Tell everyone we are still here !:
Xavieramma said, “We are here so that the world will not see any more nuclear power plants that are dangerous and uneconomic...
I saw that there are so many people in various parts of the country who are raising their protest.
It is not just about losing their land and sea, but it is about the creation of spaces where life itself is in danger.
Who would want to live in such places?”
As another woman Selvi said, “It is only after being part of the struggle that we realized that trying to establish one’s right to live as one wishes, pursuing traditional livelihoods and also questioning activities that are being implemented without consulting the people is equivalent to crime and sedition.”
As Sundari said, “We are here for a common cause- we are here for the world.
They wanted to tell the world that they are here, inside, locked up only physically within concrete and iron.
“Tell everyone we are still here”.
They are still in the Women’s Prison of Trichy, holding on to their vision of a world that is “free from one of the most toxic of human inventions".

Cambodia is mourning the death of King Father Norodom Sihanouk who died last October 15, 2012.
Sihanouk is known as a hero of the Kingdom of Cambodia for his achievements which include the peaceful claiming of the country's independence from the French colonization in 1953, for steering the country's road to prosperity during the Sangkum Reastr Niyum, for winning a case in the International Court of Justice in 1962 which recognized Cambodia's ownership of Preah Vihear Temple near the Thai border, and particularly his role in the Paris Peace Agreement in 1991 which marked the end of civil wars that brought peace to the country.
“You are our hero, you will be missed” is the common message expressed by citizens and netizens who are all mourning the death of the King.
His body was brought back to the country from Beijing where he often went to seek medical treatment.
Cambodians waited in line along the Russian Boulevard near the Council of Ministers for the return of the late King Father Norodom Sihanouk.

On October 17, 2012, millions of people waited in line along the way from the international airport to the Royal Palace to pay respect to the King reminiscent of Sihanouk's historic return to Cambodia in November 1991 after being out of the country for 13 years.
The news of Sihanouk's death broke out during the long holiday of Pchum Ben Festival.
The mood suddenly changed in the internet as people started to send their tributes to the late King.
Cambodians used the twitter hashtag #RIPKingSihanouk to express their mourning: @Cambodian_VIPz #RIPKingSihanouk We're sad and we're crying, you were leaving us.

@PinkyElevenShi Even It's Raining But Cambodian Still Stay in front of The Royal Palace This Made Me Crying #RIPKingSihanouk
There are also Facebook pages which were created in honor of the King Father:
Cambodians coming from various provinces and regions were united in mourning the death of King Norodom Sihanouk.

Khmerbird hopes to see Cambodian politicians to follow the teachings of the late King:
The King Father once said (Source):
I want my country to be independent, always independent.
I have done my best, but as a human being I cannot be perfect, nobody is perfect.
I hope all Cambodian politician would follow this statement. The King Father accepted that he is not perfect but he has a clear vision to put his country independent.
Khmerbird identifies the legacy of Sihanouk:
He built a very beautiful country and made Cambodia once as the most beautiful country in Asia.
There’s one thing we know it is true is that he loves his country and he wants to bring happiness to his people.
The King's death inspired citizens like Koh Tha to contribute more for the progress of the country:
I watched TVs broadcasted the ceremony and historical films and documents of my late great King.
I don’t know why my mind feel so mixed, sad and sorrow.
My tear dropped silently.
I deeply feel that I myself as well as my country lost the great hero.
Then, a very strong power come into my heart and talk my that “Kok Tha, there is something that you need to put more effort to help and develop your country”.
I just feel that what I have done so far is not enough and even much less than my king.
I need to continue my hard-work and my well-being to colleague, youth organizations, role models, my friends, youths, family and my love.
The National Mourning Ceremony for the King will take place until October 23, 2012. The public can pay their last respects by visiting the Royal Palace in the next three months.
After this period, the King's body will be cremated according to Buddhism ritual.
Tear gas and stun grenades were used to disperse a protest in Kuwait against changes to the electoral law.
The call for the Karamat Watan (A Nation's Dignity) march, which took place on Sunday, was made on Twitter, and attracted about 150,000 out of the country's population of 3 million.
Media outlets considered this number to be the biggest in the small Gulf emirate's history.
The protest came in reaction to the Amir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah decree to change the electoral law, making a citizen vote for one candidate instead of four, as it used to be in the elections of Kuwaiti parliament.
The protest was not only an objection for making such a change but more importantly to protest the change of a law without the parliament or the people having their say in it.
Since last June, Kuwaiti parliament has been frozen by the Amir and then dissolved by the constitutional court for 'wrong procedures' in dissolving the parliament before it.
The opposition has been protesting since but was never able to gather such a huge crowd; even the liberal "Tahalof" and Pan-Arabist "Manbar" took part in Sunday's demonstration despite their disagreement with the Islamist-Conservative opposition.
In a unique step, this demonstration was organized through Twitter.
The account @KarametWatan (which translates to A Nation's Dignity) was started to call for the protest.
It suggested an orange avatar (in reference to the 2006 youth movement that changed the electoral law from 25 districts to 5), and organized the meeting points with the following map:
The protest route shared by @KarametWatan on Twitter
As usual, Kuwaitis used Twitter to post pictures and videos of the protest.
Here are some of the pictures:
On Twitter, @NforNaser says the police asked him to drop this sign or else they would beat him up.

Lingua Project Global Voices in Malagasy
Lingua project Global Voices in Malagasy has just published its 5,000th post.
The project was started on September 12, 2007 and was one of the first African lingua project.
There are currently 16 active Malagasy translators, among them is one of the youngest Global Voices translator, 16-year-old Radifera Felana Candy.
In an effort to include ordinary Singaporeans in the planning of the nation's future, the government has launched a "national conversation" that will last for about a year to gather people's views.
Led by the Our Singapore committee, the national conversation will take place online as well as in various dialogues and meetings.
Our Singapore Conversation has both a website and a Facebook page, and urges people to share their views on Twitter using the #oursgconv hashtag.
The exercise has been met with positivity from some Singaporeans.
Petunia Lee writes about her experience of attending a dialogue session:
From the Facebook page of Our SG Conversation
I must say that my experience of the SG Conversation opened my eyes to other Singaporeans.
For one, I didn't realize that the elderly in Singapore felt such a sense of dispossession and rejection until one elderly gentleman from my group said his piece.
For another, I had had the wrong assumption that harmonious race relations are so much a part of us that we don't need to work at it.
It was a Malay lady doctor who in her impassioned speech convinced me that race relations can cause today, as much rawness as in the 1960s.
So yes... I think if, as explained by Mr Tan, the aim of the SG Conversation is to teach each of us some truths about our own country, then it did achieve that aim with me.
However, many others are wary of the exercise, seeing it as nothing more than a public relations endeavour.
Molly Meek believes that the whole national conversation is simply a ploy to change the ruling party's image:
The PAP’s strategy is intelligent—one even wonders if they have consulted professionals on the matter before proceeding with their efforts—and one cannot helped but be impressed by their measurable success.
The strategy employed is perhaps fairly simple—target a few citizens, including prominent ones and lesser-known ones, that are moderately against the PAP, give them a different impression, and let them spread the news that the PAP really is not what its detractors have made it out to be.
In fact, these do not even need to say anything—a mere talk with the PAP that leaves them with nothing to criticize will be effective enough for others who can still be convinced to support the PAP.
An editorial at publichouse.sg points out that the conversation may not lead to real change:
Even if it is assumed that the ministers leading the current initiative are of a keenly liberal bent, the older guards in the Cabinet remain likely to have a veto over the final product.
It is instructive that a majority of the more liberal suggestions made by the Remaking Singapore Committee – such as for the government to define the out-of-bounds markers for political debate, creating an Economic Relief Scheme for the structurally unemployed and subsidising the MediShield premiums of low-income groups – went unheeded.
Join the Singapore Conversation' websiteHoward Lee, writing for The Online Citizen, commented on the perceived partisan bias in the conversation:
We simply do not want to see a Conversation that is dominated by people who might be sympathetic of the ruling party's position on national issues, and are hence more likely to be part of the ancient echo chamber.
How would we look forward, if so?
In other words, Wong and others like him need to realise that the ball is in the PAP's court to prove that they can be non-partisan, rather than lambast those who are raising the red flag on partisanship as 'politicised'.
Proof is in actions, not words.
We want diverse voices, even oppositional ones that sit at the far ends of the fence of logic and possibility, to get to the bottom of matters and stimulate a hearty, if not heart-felt, discussion, rather than another consensus building show-and-tell.
And Singaporeans have the right to expect the National Conversations to be like that.
While the conversation continues in dialogue sessions and on Facebook, the Twitter hashtag #oursgconv appears to have been hijacked by anti-opposition spam: @SGSilentMaj : Freedom of expression is bad for #Singapore #sgpolitics #sgelections http://bit.ly/REUBsd http://bit.ly/TJjDZX

As Kuwaitis embarked on their largest ever protest to denounce changes to the electoral law, passed by the country's hereditary ruler while the Parliament was dissolved, Egyptians kept themselves busy on Twitter, dishing advice to them on what to do and not to do.
Samah Anwar tackles the dress code of Kuwaiti men, who wear a long flowing gown called a thobe.
@samahanwar: Wearing a thobe is not suitable for revolutions
In another tweet, she uses reason:
@samahanwar: Don't destroy your country.
You are living well.
Thank God for your blessings.
Other people aren't able to live
Many Egyptians echoed similar sentiments.
Ebrahim Elkhadm writes :
@ebrahimelkhadm: You would be losers if you listen to us.
We don't even know how to advice ourselves. Let's not be stupid
Elshazli adds:
@El_Shazli: Focus on every word written under this hash tag and do its opposition.
You will discover that your revolution has become a success
Egyptians advise protesting Kuwaitis on Twitter.
Kuwaiti Naser AlMufarrij shares this screenshot on Twitter And Kuwaiti Naser AlMufarrij shares this screenshot of a tweet, which reads in Arabic:
Why would you have a revolution when the youngest child amongst you is richer than an Egyptian minister?
Many Egyptians used the opportunity to joke about their own revolution, like Gepril Thuwaiba who tweets:
@Gepril1: Before you take to the streets next time, everyone should agree with his friends.
After the march, don't talk, argue and part ways
@Gepril1: There are only three speeches .
If that happens, then congratulations!
After your big celebration, don't forget us.
Remember us with a few barrels as our circumstances are dire
Kuwaitis were also quick to point out that the protests in Kuwait were just that - protests and not a revolution.
Barcelonya explains:
@Barcelonya: This isn't a revolution. It is a protest.
But Mona Abo Elyazeed is adamant in her advice and shares one thought:
Recently, the rule of law has been taking a beating by this PP government.
With the now infamous section 34, things have come round to another galloping dictatorship, and we can see how that corruption of power has changed the characters of those whom we viewed as pillars and exemplars of our society.
Jumbie's Watch writes about governance and the rule of law in Trinidad & Tobago.
On Twitter, Tounsia Hourra (Free Tunisian) says there is a general strike in Thala, in the province of Kasserine, today .
The protest is against rising unemployment and neglecting the maintenance of the city.

Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech was rapped by netizens across the Arab World today.
Tweets questioning United States (US) foreign policy in the Middle East continued as Romney, the Republican nominee for the US presidential elections, spoke at the Virginia Military Institute.
If elected, Romney pledged to take a more "engaged" foreign policy, as opposed to Obama's wait-and-see approach as "profound upheaval" shook the region.
He also said he would arm Syrian rebels, at least those among them who share his values.
All the way from Venezuela, journalist Dima Khatib isn't pleased.
She tweets :
@Dima_Khatib: All we had missing was a US Presidential candidate using Syria in his election campaign to promote himself under the pretext that he is better than Obama!!!
The plot is complete
And she asks:
@Dima_Khatib: Is there anyone left who hasn't sucked the blood of the Syrian revolution for any of their interests?
Algerian Imad Mesdoua quips:
@ImadMesdoua: #Romney knows MENA well.
He saw #Libya and thought here's a good idea, let's arm the rebels in #Syria! #letmeknowhowthatworksoutforyou
Shadi Hamid, from the Brooking Doha Centre, Qatar, writes:
@shadihamid: Romney's Middle East speech could be important.
One hopes it can encourage Obama to clarify his own approach, which has been tepid & vague.
He adds:
@shadihamid: Issue of US "leading" vs. "leading from behind" is real & shouldn't be dismissed.
Real doubts abt US resolve & staying power in Arab world.
Bahraini human rights activist Maryam Al Khawaja says:
@MARYAMALKHAWAJA: Judging from his statements, #Romney will be a complete disaster to #humanrights in the #GCC , even more so than #Obama... #bahrain
And Foreign Policy managing editor Blake Hounshell agrees:
@blakehounshell: One point Romney and Obama seem to agree on: Leaving Bahrain off the list of revolutions America supports.
While Qatari Shayma Al-Naimi, who studies in the US, tweets:
@iShayma: #Romney really wants to talk about "America's record" in peaceful history?????
And she adds:
@iShayma: I honestly cannot believe what #Romney is saying right now!
Absolutely disgusting.
It's sad to know that people with his mentality exist.
Palestinian Iyad El-Baghdadi, who tweets from Dubai, notes:
@iyad_elbaghdadi: The last time the US displayed some "leadership in the Middle East", 600,000 Iraqis died. #Romney
And he proposes a compromise:
@iyad_elbaghdadi: Half my timeline says #Obama sucks, and the other half says #Romney sucks.
Guys, I agree with you.

On Tuesday 9 October, 1962, Uganda got its independence as the Union Jack flag of England was lowered, the Ugandan flag raised whilst jubilant Ugandans sang the Uganda National Anthem.
On Tuesday 9 October, 2012, Uganda marked the Golden Jubilee of this historic event.
Many occasions have taken place around the country to mark this special day, which started with the Kampala Carnival on Sunday 7 October.
Many people converged at Kololo Airstrip today to mark the 50 years of independence.
Uganda has had eight presidents since independence, namely, King Sir Edward Muteesa II, Apollo Milton Obote, Idi Amin Dada, Yusuf kironde Lule, Godfrey Lukongwa Binayiisa, Paulo Muwanga, Tito Okello Lutwa, and the current President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.
The country still faces challenges of health, education, press freedom among others.
Generally however, many Ugandans seem to be happy about 50 years of independence, and look forward to the next 50 years, as they say Yoga Yoga Uganda (the title of the official Uganda@50 song, which means congratulations in Luganda).
Some Ugandans, however, think the the celebration is a waste of resources in a country where some people sleep hungry.
Ugandans online have been discussing the Jubilee on Twitter and Facebook.
Twitter
During the main event, there was a spectacular show by Uganda's fighter jets.
Norman Anguzu tweets a pic of the jets in air:
@normzo: #UgandaAt50 Awesome picture from 'The Mzungu Diaries' #Ugandapic.twitter.com/IJ25bPUw
Lucy Smize tweets about the colors of the Ugandan flag and their meanings:
@Lucy_smize: Black, Yellow, Red: People, Sunshine, Brotherhood. #UgandaAt50
Patricia Kahill wishes Ugandans nice independence day, but comments on the load shedding of power by Umeme, the company providing hydro electric power:
@pkahill: Happy independence day in Dark #fumemeug@50 #ILoveUgBecause more
Rosebell Kagumire says that despite Uganda celebrating 50 years, the country does show any sign of maturity:
@rosebellk: You r celebrating 50 years of independence + no sign of maturity whatsoever!
You cant stand dissent, how will you grow?#Ugandaat50
Angelo Izama believes Uganda is still one of the most beautiful countries in the world:
@opiaiya: Still possibly one of the most beautiful countries in the world #Uganda@50
Vanessa proposes a tost to Uganda's Jubilee:
@v_sees_you: A toast to Uganda! 50 years Independent! \☺/ May God continue to bless our nation!
Timothy Kalyegira tweets about Google Uganda's Jubilee homepage:
@timkalyegira: Even Google is into Uganda@50 hype, with a Uganda theme on its homepage.
(But I bet the Internet link is off at Google's Kampala office!)
Google Uganda Homepage
Maxentia comments about the colors she wore today:
@maxen1987: btw, i wore my national flag colours; black yellow red to honour the day #Uganda@50. it feels good
Happy Betty believes she is blessed to witness Uganda at 50 years:
Happy Betty: Blesed 2b hea as Uganda meks 50 sure i shall stil b around at 100 bt 2my generation thus far our fathers hv come its our turn 2take Uganda thr da nxt 50 yrs we determine what we shall have then-God sure is with us!
Facebook
Edwinsmith Kigozi says:
It feels really good to see Ugandans coming together to celebrate 50 years as Ugandans not looking at the different political parties but just as Ugandans.
Let's go Uganda.
For God and my country.
Akampa Ivan feels that the fighter jets show was not the best Uganda could have:
Someone should have given me a good stone to shoot for you one of these Jets that have been polluting Kampala with noise and smoke.
I wonder whether our Government lacks a proper procurement unit to procure jets that are of advanced technology of current other than old crap or Uganda lacks qualified personnel with jet flying skills.
So much disappointed.
A proper ride would actually move faster than these jets.
Anyway its Uganda at 50, and am proud to be Ugandan.
Happy Golden Jubilee Uganda!!!!
Lets celebrate.
Shy V Okecho notes that as Uganda is growing old, everything else is growing old too, a reference to un-repaired roads, schools and hospitals:
But Uganda@50 as it grows, the roads have also grown, Hospitals grown with no medicine M.P's get bribes of 200,000 to pass the budget.
But Uganda my country.
Evelyn Mirembe Nkuyahaga says:
WoW this is just awesome!
Uganda@50!
I Love my Country and my President!
Ululululu...
Thank you Jesus for Uganda!

After the most contested and intense elections of the last decade, Venezuela will add six more years to the administration that began in 1999 with Hugo Chávez Frías.
The traffic on social networks, particularly on Twitter, was extremely intense, especially moments before the official announcement of the results.
From the side that supports the President, tweets express joy and satisfaction, while those who support Henrique Capriles share mixed feelings of disappointment with deep convictions that changes are possible in the future.
In a detailed reading, the image of a country cut in two is even sharper than before.
The separations between different strata of society remain part of the general disocurse.

Adriana (@SombreroRojo) says:
@SombreroRojo : Go on! go on with your inclusion discourse: tierruos , brutes, illiterate.
We can have Chavez for...
30 more years? yes, easily!
Meanwhile MariAzul (@Mariazul84) writes:
@Mariazul84 : Like that, with disdain, with disgust, with arrogance and all, they have to accept that the tierruos choose the president for the "nice people".
User @Racksonador calls for a stop to alarmist discussion:
@Racksonador : And stop saying that people are going to get killed or that you are going to get killed and that you are leaving the country.
IT'S DONE #ElcomandanteSeQueda (The commander is staying)
On the side of the opposition there is gratitude for Henrique Capriles and his campaign, criticism towards the President's opportunism, and allegations of serious irregularities that go back to the days of the campaign.
Similarly, many also call fellow Capriles supporters to reflect on the results, to continue the fight, and to take into account that while victory was not achieved in this election, the leaders of the opposition now have an organized group that will allow for cohesive and more efficient work in the years to come.
Fedosy Santaella (@Fedosy) writes:
@Fedosy : Capriles will continue serving, I will continue writing.
My country is my country.
I am no less Venezuelan, and no less a writer.
Moraima Guanipa (@haticos) says:
@haticos : I will recognize the victory of Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías but I will never applaud the opportunistic, abusive, and manipulative way in which it was imposed.
User @upallove , meanwhile, expresses her disappointment in the results of this and of past presidential elections: @upallove : Cristina won in Argentina.
@DynamiteAndre: "LONG LIVE CHÁVEZ!" followed by the sound of shots in a row.
No, chavista friend.
You won't be able to convince me that this is OK.
After sifting through the numerous exchanges that took place during the night of the election, an idea seems to creep up as part of the debate: the need for mutual recognition to overcome the long separation of social classes, and the need for self-criticism from each of the players.
Luis Carlos Díaz (@LuisCarlos) points to this need that stands out as a result of this election:
@LuisCarlos : The competition for the recognition of the other begins.
Luis Carlos also highlighted a fact for reflection by all political tendencies:
@LuisCarlos : President Chávez wins a presidential election for the fourth time and will have a 1999-2019 term.
From the side supporting Chávez, Gabriel López (@GaboVzla) says:
@GaboVzla: The victory that we all already know about also deserves profound reflection, which will surely come.
Today, let's celebrate and strengthen our democracy
Many questions remain unanswered and many more opinions will fill the discussion this week in the Venezuelan blogosphere.
Today, social networks in Venezuela show a country at the fringe.
Along with testimonies, information, rumors and recommendations, citizen media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Flickr have shared photos that portray a massive participation to elect the next President of the Republic.
According to some comments, some voting centers opened their doors to the first assistants on Saturday at midnight, and they continue welcoming citizens from inside the country and abroad.
Maritza Salazar (@MaritzaSalazar) shared this picture of voters waiting in queue since the night before:

Fernando Rios (@FernandoRiosD) shared a photo of Carlos Urbaneja, a 94-year-old citizen whose identity number is 5 and who went to exercise his right to vote:

Under the hashtag #NoEsUnaColaEsUnCamino (it is not a queue, it is a road) that makes reference to Henrique Capriles' slogan "there's a road"; many Twitter users shared pictures of the voting centers, the long queues, cheering messages, and fingers painted in violet ink which confirms without doubt that someone voted.
Carlos Garcia (@carlosgarciareq) and Mirian de Aristimuño (@MiriamJSdeA) presented their fingers painted in violet under the hashtag #yavote (I already voted):

This post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2012. Portuguese photographer Eduardo Leal has published an online photographic gallery that aims to "give a voice to both sides, the supporters of Chávez and of ."
In 'Faces and Voices of an Election', Eduardo captures the thoughts and feelings of the Venezuelan people as they explain who they will vote for in the presidential election on Sunday, October 7, 2012.
He opens the introduction to his online gallery with a brief overview of the last 14 years under the government of President Hugo Chávez:
With him in power a new socialism government change the face of the country, previously better known for beauty pageants and as the birthplace of Simón Bolivar, the Latin America liberator.
Social reforms were established, help to the poor increased in housing benefits and school programmes.
A voice was given to the ones that never had it.

Eduardo continues explaining that, for many years, Chávez ruled with minimum opposition.
This opposition was "usually composed by an elite class that for decades enjoyed the benefits of living in an oil-rich country," he says.
But Eduardo also points out that, over the years, opposition to Chávez has grown as problems become more evident.
Violence on the streets went to levels never seen, putting Caracas on the top of the list of the most dangerous cities in the world.
Electricity and food shortages, raising inflation and inflammable speech’s from the President start to create new winds and opportunities to the opposition.

Eduardo goes on to discuss the current division in Venezuelan society:
The supporters of Chávez, known as Chavistas, in one side and on the other the opposition composed not only by the middle class and the elite as before, but also by common people that feels that the country needs a change.
Copyright Eduardo Leal.
He refers to Henrique Capriles, Chávez's opponent, as the face of "the rise of the opposition" and "the one that for the first time can challenge President Hugo Chávez."

With this project, Eduardo wants to "create a better understanding of what the Venezuelan people think about the changes and hopes for their country."

This post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2012.
Emotions ran high on Sunday night after the official results of the October 7, 2012, presidential elections were released.
President Hugo Chávez was re-elected with 55.14% of the vote, while opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, obtained 44.24%, as reported by Venezuela's National Electoral Council .
Part of the country celebrated the continuation of the 'Bolivarian Revolution' under Chávez, while the other side lamented another electoral loss.
Chávez supporters reflect
Tamara Pearson in Venezuelan Analysis refers to Sunday's results as "an imperfect victory."
She writes that despite the celebratory mood among Chávez supporters on Sunday night, she felt "a bit down":
because over six million people supported, by voting for Capriles, selfishness (he had focused his campaign on Venezuela ending its solidarity with other countries) and the destruction and sale of their country.
She goes on to analyze why the gap between the opposition and Chávez is narrowing.
From her perspective, "the opposition will come out of these elections emboldened" so "the revolution can't lie down and relax":
If we don’t beat corruption and bureaucracy in the next period, we could lose this revolution.
Now that the presidential elections are over, we have two main questions: How will we deepen the revolution, and will it survive?

Antonio Aponte, from the blog Un Grano de Maíz , congratulates fellow Chávez supporters for the victory, but also looks at future challenges for the Bolivarian Revolution.
He also analyzes the narrowing distance between government supporters and the opposition:
from a 26% difference in the presidential election of 2006 we have moved to a weak 10%.
We lost almost 20% of our votes.
Preliminary analysis indicates that we lost in low-income sectors and didn't gain votes from middle class sectors.
Why the decline?
The answer lies in the essence of socialism, without understanding it we are destined to fail: Socialism is the essence of love, of fraternal relationships, of the sense of belonging to society.
Capitalism has as its essence selfishness, individual solutions.
That is the foundation of the battle, selfishness in a fierce fight against love, and that is where our efforts must be directed.
He concludes that 'revolutionaries' must urgently acquire a 'culture of discussion': "A revolution that doesn't discuss, dies":
Study, discussion, must be the main tasks of society.
Ignorance is counterrevolutionary.
¡Long live Chávez!
Reflections from the opposition
Many opposition bloggers followed Capriles' campaign closely, with enthusiasm for what seemed to be the right moment for a change in Venezuela.
They quickly reacted to the results, sharing their sadness and disappointment, but also looking forward with self-criticism.
Blogger Alex Boyd says he "never expected a different outcome".
He shares a map of the results and adds a note about electoral fraud:
Hugo Chavez trounced the opposition candidate again.
Six years on, Chavez still is the choice of the majority of my countrymen.
And that's OK, I don't have a problem with that.
The good thing about it is that Henrique Capriles, Leopoldo Lopez, Ramon Guillermo Aveledo et al buried the phantom of electoral fraud in Venezuela.
By claiming, repeatedly, that the system had been sufficiently audited, and that the opposition had managed to place witnesses in 100% of voting centres nationwide, there is no room for further entertaining the thought of fraud.
Manuel Silva from the blog No solo con la palabra thinks that one of the worst things the opposition has done throughout multiple electoral processes is not being prepared for a defeat.
However, Silva argues that the opposition's loss is not a political loss:
Here we lost because the majority of Venezuelans identify with this form of government .
We are willing to accept abuse and trampling as a way of life, we have made insecurity something natural, we have settled for misery, we have accepted gladly to live as we have done in recent years: hating each other.
Meanwhile, according to blogger Mirelis Morales Tovar from Caracas Ciudad de la Furia , the opposition hasn't learned enough:
There are many who need to look a little further.
Venezuela is not Caracas, it is not La Lagunita nor Twitter.
We are a country divided in equal parts and we must learn to look to the other side.
Alejandro Tarre argues that the opposition must be ready and willing to continue offering an alternative for Venezuelans, considering that "politics, like life, is not stagnant but fluid" and that in December Venezuelans will vote for mayors and governors:
The opposition mass is there, the challenge is simply to shake it out its stupor to then mobilize it.
Much has been said that, after his great campaign, Capriles is in an ideal position to take lead the opposition and shield the unity Well, here is his first challenge.
Now more than ever we need our rock star encouraging people and touring the country to support candidates for mayors and governors.
These are only a few of the thoughts from opposing political sides after the most intense and contested presidential election in years.
More reactions have also been shared on Twitter, the citizen media platform of choice for most Venezuelan netizens.

The clip “Zambia: Good Copper, Bad Copper” was first reported in the blogosphere by the Zambian Economist.
Chola Mukanga, the creator of the blog, wrote:
A powerful documentary on the economic plunder of copper mining in Zambia and the associated environmental damage.
These are issues we have discussed many times on this website but it is good to see them brought together in this video.
The video was produced April 2012.
Sadly, it takes non-Zambian journalists to put a documentary like this together.
Where are our investigative journalists?
i really do not even know what to say but all i can say is that i feel so disgusted and i really do not know what we can do and what we shall do to make the dice fall in our favor as zambians one day
Cry our beloved country.
Why should we remain poor when a coveted product is plenty and mined at the expense of the locals' health

i am zambian too and after watching this i think we need to come up together and try to fight for our country and not just watch the video and let go we need to come up with something,we are not going to say MMD OR PF HAVE DONE THIS ,,we can stand up and let our voices be heard ..
The least Zambians can hope for is that political leaders in the country not only get to watch the documentary but do something about it as well.
Two young men, members of the indigenous Mapuche community from Southern Chile, were sentenced on August 13, 2012, to 541 days of prison for their responsibility in an attack against police officers during a clash on November 2, 2011, in the rural sector of the Ercilla commune.
Nineteen-year-old Paulino Levipán and eighteen-year-old Daniel Levinao started a hunger strike on August 27, 2012, along with Rodrigo Montoya Melinao and Eric Montoya Montoya to protest their detention.
The latter were accused of attempted murder of a policeman that was guarding ranch Centenario, in the same Ercilla community, on August 2011.
They were still being processed in an oral trial.
Yesterday, October 25, the four mapuche prisoners decided to abandon their protest after the Chilean Supreme Court decided to comply with some of their demands.
They are already at the prison's nurse station receiving food.

The maximum Chilean court ruled to partially annul the trial that convicted them.
In Daniel's case, a new trial was ordered because the first one lacked enough proof to reach a sentence. As for Paulino, the court changed his accusation to injuries based on "evident mistakes in the application of the law", therefore his sentence changed from 10 years in prison to 3 years in parole.
The current government's stance
President Sebastián Piñera spoke about the hunger strike during a visit to the Ercilla commune this October, echoing the government's long-standing policy towards the clashes with these communities:
Are we going to allow this attempted murder to go unpunished?
Justice decided a final ruling and therefore I think that if they committed a crime, the hunger strike is not legitimate or effective.
The conflict
The following video, uploaded by YouTube user PipeHenriquezO, summarizes the Mapuche conflict in Chile in 30 seconds.
The conflict focuses on claiming the preservation and autonomy of the lands that they have inhabited for centuries and that are now being exploited for their natural resources:
Also, on The Ambivalent Abyss Tumblr blog you can find a photo gallery of the Mapuche movement throughout history.
Netizens have also commented on the various reports about the protests in favor of the Mapuche, the government's reactions, and the diverse television reports that have come out on the issue.
Opinions are conflicting.
Journalist and golfer Alejandro Bascur (@AlejandroBascur) was happy after a TV program aired on national television:
@AlejandroBascur: Great special report by TVN (National Television of Chile).
They are finally showing the terror that the Mapuche sow in the South, with no respect to human rights #InformeEspecial
Referring to the statements by President Piñera, journalist and blogger Francisco Méndez (@Franmen) pointed out:
@Franmen: President Piñera could give stigmatized students and Mapuche the same support he offers the police
Furthermore, Mapuche journalist, writer and blogger Pedro Cayuqueo (@pcayuqueo) asserted:
@pcayuqueo: It's hard to talk about the background of the Mapuche issue when what triggers debates is police chronicles.
Even so, some of us try.
Meanwhile, Mapuche blogger Punngey posted the following thoughts on Tumblr regarding the end of the hunger strike:
TODAY, 60 days of fasting...the counting has ended, 60 days of sacrifice to bring out the truth, a 60-day battle of courage, pride, that pride that accompanies each one of us who ARE Mapuche, although some say that we don't exist anymore.
We hope this struggle ends soon Let's continue fighting for forest companies and dams to leave our land, for the healing of our mapu (land), to continue recovering what was taken from us, and to finally walk freely through our mapu, that our children may not continue growing up with repression filling their dreams...and that they may walk through the free lands of our grandparents...AMULEPE TAIÑ WEICHAN!!!
WEWAIÑ.
THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES...

15 year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot on 9 October 2012 by members of TTP (Tahreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) because she was a fearless activist of girl education in Swat.
Malala is slowly recovering.
She is not totally out of danger, and a complete recovery will take sometime.
Petition for Nobel Peace Prize
A petition has been placed by a Pakistani-British woman living in Birmingham, Shaida Choudry, to nominate Malala Yousufzai for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Nominating Malala for the Nobel prize can be achieved if 'national politicians' take interest.
Shaida Choudry wants William Hague, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to go forward with this task.
Till now more than a hundred thousand people have signed her petition.
The reason why a Nobel prize must be presented to Malala is stated here:
A Nobel Peace Prize for Malala will send a clear message that the world is watching and will support those who stand up for gender equality and universal human rights, including the right to education for girls.
The #Malala hashtag has been shared by more than five thousand people over twitter.
The #Nobel4Malala hashtag has been shared by approximately nine hundred people just in nine days.
Expressing her reason for signing the petition, Farina Alam writes: ...Malala gives me hope
"Such bravery and belief at such a young age should be recognised and serve as an inspiration and as a beacon of hope to people young and old across the world"
Celebrating Malala Day
The United Nations has announced celebrating November 10 (Saturday) as Malala Day.
People around the world celebrated Malala as a beacon for 32 million girls who can not go to school.
In Pakistan, demonstrations in support of Malala were held in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi.
This day was celebrated in more than 100 countries across the globe.
But in Malala's hometown open house events couldn't be organized out of fear of possible terrorist attacks.
The UN special envoy on global education growth, Mr. Gordon Brown was in Pakistan on Friday (9th November) in order to discuss the future of girls education in Pakistan.
Speaking to AFP he said that a country can not prosper if only 2% of the economic budget is spent on education.
Political party MQM (Muttahida Quami Movement) officially celebrated Malala Day at their headquarters in Karachi called nine-zero:
MQM celebrating Malala Day.
From Twitter @SahilMQM
Unfortunately, no celebration took place in Swat due to possible terrorist threats.
For to express her love for Malala, 11 year-old girl, Bushra Siddique, writes on her blog:
In my view Malala is the ray of light and hope for Pakistan.
May Allah Save Her!

This post is part of our special coverage Myanmar's Rohingya.
The June 2012 riots in western Myanmar involving Rohingyas and Rakhine prompted several international Islamic organizations and countries to extend their offer of assistance to resolve the conflict and deliver aid to victims.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), for instance, has proposed the establishment of a permanent office in Myanmar.
This initiative sparked phenomenal opposition across the country, especially in Yangon, Mandalay, Pakkoku, Sittwe and Phyar Pone. Online comments are also almost unanimous in opposing an OIC presence in the country.
Many people in Myanmar believe that an OIC office is not necessary to help the Muslim minority in Myanmar.
Dr. Aye Maung, a member of parliament and the president of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party has argued that aid and donation can be delivered without setting up an OIC office in the country:
OIC is mainly for religion purposes, an organisation with 57 countries which are cooperating with Islamic countries.
It's unlike ASEAN which is a regional and multi-religious association nor European Union. And therefore we can and should receive the donations through the government without opening an OIC office.
Myo Set advised the OIC to communicate directly with other UN bodies and NGOs if they found the government machinery unreliable:
Burma has full cooperation with NGOs and UN which is why no more political coalition is needed if OIC's pure intention is to provide only food, shelter, health care service and security for Muslims.
Whatever they wish to supply can go through the UN if Burmese authorities are not reliable.
Ko Htike wrote with the view that the riot was not a religious clash, thereby asserting that the OIC should not shape the situation to be one.
The Rohingya issue is neither a religious clash nor ethnic clash.
It's just a problem between illegal immigrants and locals.
It is such an ordinary problem which usually occur in many countries across the world.
Nothing more.
I think OIC should not shape the situation to be a religious issue.
I respect the kindness to provide humanitarian aid.
If the intent is for humanitarian reason, other states and regions in Myanmar should be given assistance as well just like what other countries (e.g. Japan, US) are doing.
Ko Htike echoed the popular domestic opinion in Myanmar, opposing the Rohingya's struggle for recognition as an ethnic minority in the country.
Opinion on the Rohingyas is divided; the global community consider them as among the most persecuted minorities in Asia.
For several weeks, there has been talk of a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the OIC and Myanmar's Ministry of Border Affairs, though there is little information about whether the agreement actually exists, and if so, what it comprises.
When people started posting comments opposing the agreement, Hmuu Zaw from the president's office clarified that the OIC office would only be a temporary liaison office rather than an official representative office.
This explanation didn't convince many.
Tyfone Athene questioned the possible duration of the temporary office:
Temporary liaison office? how long will it take? 60 or unlimited years?
Poe Pwint Phyu thinks that if the government regarded the original incident a non-sectarian clash, then the agreement with the OIC should not have been signed:
Photo - CJ Myanmar Facebook Page
My last question to Mr. President's advisers: Do you see this recent conflict as merely a religious riot (thus you allowed a temporary office for OIC) or urgent issue of neglect and violence which victimized Rakhine natives?
Others criticized the lack of transparency on procedures of government ministries.
Ah Moe made this request :
Be it a temporary liaison office or permanent branch office, what we are asking for now is to show a copy of that MOU to public, that's what we want mainly.
The government attempted to dissuade people from joining the protests against the setting up of an OIC office; despite this, they were held October 15 in several cities across the country.
Bowing to public pressure, the president's office announced on the same day that the government would not permit the setting up of an OIC liaison office in Myanmar.
However, it didn't mention the content of the controversial MOU.
It was not clear if the government had informed the OIC of this decision.
The government has assured the public that it would continue to accept humanitarian aid by coordinating closely with OIC and other international groups.
Meanwhile, the OIC said they have yet to receive a formal notification from Myanmar government regarding a decision to disallow a liaison office.
In related news, the Myanmar Red Cross Society issued a press release denying rumors that it is sponsoring a hidden OIC office inside its building.

After causing wide spread damage along the Atlantic Coast in United States, Super storm sandy is being labelled as the costliest storm ever.
With estimates running as high as $45 billion for reconstruction and rebuilding, the country prepares to cope with the losses.
At least 33 people have been reported dead and scores displaced across the East Coast.
Amidst the furor, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the founder of banned militant organization Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) and head of Jaamat ud Dawa (JuD) offered a considerable amount of humanitarian aid to the US to bear losses.
Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on the Rockaways and Breezy Point in Queens.
Many lost their homes, businesses and possessions.
Image by Kevin Downs.
Pledging help of every kind, he said "Jamaat-ud-Dawa is ready to send its volunteers, doctors, food, medicines and other relief items on humanitarian grounds if the US government allows us.”
Known as the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the JuD founder also carries a $10million US bounty on his head.
The American Embassy in Pakistani capital Islamabad however refused to accept help from Saeed.
Using their Twitter account, the embassy made it clear that while they appreciate the gesture of Muslims to help, they clearly did not take his offer seriously.
@usembislamabad (US Embassy Islamabad): We respect the Islamic tradition of help to the needy, but we can’t take Hafiz Saeed’s offer seriously.
Following the tweet, a spokesperson for JuD posted the following replies:
@JuD_Official (Jamat 'ud' Da'wah): @usembislamabad Our offer was precisely due to the seriousness of the matter.
We hope Muslims in #US will keep the tradition alive.
Inshallah
@JuD_Official (Jamat 'ud' Da'wah) @usembislamabad Our Help offer is for the American people, we will engage Muslims in US to be at forefront to help their fellow countrymen.
The US embassy went as far as calling Saeed a suspect for his involvement in Mumbai attacks and also labelling his organization JuD as a ‘designated terrorist’ organization.
@usembislamabad (US Embassy Islamabad ‏): Saaed is wanted for suspected involvement in the Mumbai attacks, which killed 166.
The Twitter account for JuD was once more ready with a response.
@JuD_Official (Jamat 'ud' Da'wah): @usembislamabad US govt has conceded to the fact of inadmissible evidence against Hafiz Saeed.
UNSCR hearing is pending.
Leaves nothing behind.
Reactions over this offer remain mixed.
While many term it as generous, some also see the irony behind it. @Rifaqat_Mir (Rifaqat A. Mir): In spite of the enmity the US poses to Hafiz Saeed he still has the generosity and benevolence to show compassion for his enemy
@humayusuf (Huma Yusuf): They say Muslims don't have a sense of humour, but Hafiz Saeed's offer to help #Sandy victims is HILARIOUS http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-18499-Hafiz-Saeed-offers-humanitarian-aid-to-US … @anDYRude (Anirudh Malladi): Just read that Hafiz Saeed, a dreaded terrorist, has offered "Help in the form of food, doctors etc" to victims of #HurricaneSandy.
LMAO!
@nidak_ (Nida Khan): Entertaining exchange of trolling going on between Hafiz Saeedand the US embassy Islamabad. 1-1, I'd say. #NextRound?
@anamzehra86 (Anam Zehra): US Embassy's response to Hafiz Saeed's offer is their way of saying "we take your religion seriously,you should too"
Syrian photographers from around the country are revealing, sharing, and archiving Syria's uprising through photographs which showcase destruction.
Despite the limited media sources, what comes out from Syria shows the horrific reality Syrians on the ground face as they see their country being literally torn apart.
Although there is no liable resources to confirm the locations of the photographs nor the number of victims, the next few pictures are just a sample to consider of how Syria's infrastructure and residential areas have been affected.
Among hundreds of photographers, Yazan Homsy ‏shares with us scenes from the destruction of Homs.
He describes himself as:
@YazanHomsY: Yazan Homsy, son of the great Homs, activist in the Syrian revolution, from Khalidya neighborhood.
Revolution until victory or martyrdom
He has posted his pictures on his Facebook, illustrating the destruction of buildings in Homs city.

If you are stuck for a few minutes at a traffic signal in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, you will probably see children rushing up to the windows of your vehicle.
Some of these children carry flowers; some have a stack of books in the crook of their arms, some carry bundles of newspapers and some have candy for sale.
They try their best to earn sympathy from commuters to sell their goods.
This painful scene is ubiquitous on the streets of Dhaka.
These street children are known as Pothoshishu.
The street is where they earn their living.
The total number of street children in Bangladesh is estimated at 400,000.
Almost half of these children live in Dhaka city alone.
A very large percentage of these children are young girls.
These female street children are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Street girls Mili and Brishti earn their living by selling flowers.

On March, 2012 Unnayan Onneshan published a report titled “social connection of the street girls in the context of Dhaka city, Bangladesh” .
The research shows that the majority of the street girls (37.50%) sell flowers for a living.
18.80% of these young girls are forced into prostitution, 6.25 % work in the clothing industry, 6.25% become beggars, 12.50% start as shopkeepers and 6.25% are paper-hawkers.
Almost half of these girls have a measly daily income of Tk.
101-299 ($1.25-$3.75).
The daily income of 43.75 % of the girls is Tk.
300 (US$3.75) and above.
But they seem to be the lucky ones, because 6.25 % of the street girls earn less than Tk.
100 ($1.25) per day.
Almost 45% of these girls do not receive any treatment from government medical facilities or clinics.
3 out of 10 of these girls have never been enrolled in any type of educational institution.
Most women in Bangladesh are vulnerable to fall victim to abuse such as rape, murder, eve teasing, dowry and acid attacks.
But the street children who spend their childhood under the open skies of Dhaka face such risks on a daily basis.
This graph is taken from the above report, which shows statistics of violences inflicted upon street girls:
Statistics on violence on street girls
Neelkabyo writes this about the helpless situation of the street girls at Addar Asor forum:
Where it is hard to guarantee the safety of our daughters inside our own homes, the thought of the 25.7% of female children who live on the streets is truly terrifying.
Nizam Kutubee writes in the Prothom Alo Blog:
Recently there has been a lot of discussion about sexual abuse laws.
But no one is giving any serious thought on the issue of the safety of street girls.
They constantly suffer sexual abuse because they have to spend their nights on the street completely unprotected.
But no one in the authority seems to have any concerns about them.

Blogger Maa cited the lyrics of a renowned Bangla song to draw attention to this issue and to request a safe home for these children:

This post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011/12.
The Syrian government conducted a deadly airstrike against Syrians - standing in line waiting for bread in a bakery in Halfaya, in Hama.
Estimates put the number of those killed between 90 to 300 people in the attack on the town, which rebels say they have recently liberated from Assad forces.
Online, activists are livid that the world continues to watch as innocents are being massacred.
Graphic photographs of mutilated bodies, as well as videos of the aftermath of the attack, are being circulated online, showing the devastation.
Leila Nachawati Rego writes:
@leila_na: The Syrian regime´s new strategy is to bomb bakeries.
200 people killed today in Hama.
A civilian massacre.
Devastating. #Syria
Syrian Rafif Jouejati tweets her exasperation:
@RafifJ: Waiting for world leaders to find something to top "We condemn in the strongest possible terms.." #Halfaya_Massacre #Syria
and adds:
@RafifJ: Let history books show that #Assad committed genocide while world watched, paralyzed, and did little more than use strong language. #Syria
And an angry Razan Ghazzawi blogs:
Look into Halfaya martyrs’ eyes and dare to tell me you’re worried about “Islamists” in Syria.
Dare to tell me, you piece of shit, that you’re worried about “FSA human rights violations,” worried about “civil war,” about Qatar and KSA, and that’s why you won’t support people’s revolution.
So you’re worried.
I see.
That explains a lot.
Of course.
Newsflash: the minute you have forsaken the people of Syria, the Syrian people have also forsaken you and what you worry about habibi: you and your civilization doesn’t exist in our time and space.
It’s over, you and I aren’t fellow human being anymore.
Also, peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in Syria today as part of his mission to "broker a solution" in the country.
Hassan Hassan notes:
@hhassan140: Halfaya massacre, celebrating Brahimi's arrival to Damascus, shames all those who still hope Assad understands anything other than force.
and he adds:
@hhassan140: History: on this day, Lakhdar Brahimi visits Damascus to talk to Assad who spoke loudly in Halfaya by killing 300 ppl lining up for bread.

The New Patriotic Party (NPP), the strongest opposition party in Ghana has challenged the recent Presidential election results, claiming electoral fraud.
Refusing to accept the results declared by the electoral commission, the NPP has decided to take the matter to the courts.
According to Ghana Decides:
The largest opposition party in Ghana, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has challenged the results of the 2012 Presidential election, accusing the Electoral Commission of Ghana of colluding with the incumbent, National Democratic Congress (NDC) to steal votes.
The Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan, has denied the allegations saying the the NPP can challenge the results in Ghana’s courts according to the electoral laws of the country.
The Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan, declared President Mahama winner by 50.70% of the votes, beating his main challenger Nana Akufo-Addo of the NPP who polled 47.7% of the votes.
NPP's projected the results online.
Photo source: Nana Ado (NPP's presidential candidate) Facebook page.
NPP's projection on their Facebook page showed that they have won the elections according to the results they received from their polling agents.
Ghana Decides reports:
The NPP maintains that results on the “blue sheet”, which they received at polling stations and collation centres across the country, where slightly change to favour Candidate Mahama of the NDC.
Party gurus of the NPP have been holding a crunch meeting over the matter whether to consider a court action.
Ghana Decides reports:
Following this, the NPP has resolved to take the issue to court and has vowed to use all available legal means to seek justice.
Meanwhile, numerous supporters of the NPP have poured onto the streets of Circle, ostensibly to listen to party leaders who are assembling near the Kwame Nkrumah Circle to address the teeming crowd.
Many observer and monitoring missions, including the African Union and CODEO have endorsed the results of the Electoral Commission and have called for calm.
These are some of the views of Ghanaians on Twitter:
@nosivid: Nana Addo goes round repeating bogus allegations of electoral fraud with the claim of having evidence and calls it EXPLANATION #GhanaDecides
@kwasireports: "I'll go2 court"-Nana Akuffo-Addo reaffirms as NPP preps evidence 2 back claims of electoral fraud by rulin NDC #GhanaDecides #amaniee
‏@nfaoforiatta: It is clear they know they lost.

Let the Supreme Court decide now. #GhanaDecides
@sam_btw: Ghana's opposition NPP discovered >10% irregular votes in presidential election 2012.
Fraud?
Now it's up to the supreme court. #GhanaDecides
Lawyers representing NPP formally filed a petition at the Supreme Court on 28 December, 2012.
The NPP only has 21 days to protest against the election results by law or else the incumbent will still be sworn in on 7 January, 2013.

Inaccurate media descriptions of Africa are not a rare phenomenon - even if the comedy of errors has steadily declined over the last few years.
The misrepresentation of the continent in the media is not a trivial subject, as Professor Charles Moumouni explains :
Poor representation of Africa in Western media is neither a new nor an exceptional phenomenon.
It was already a subject of concern during the 1970s, notably in the context of discussions about New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO).
But the image of Africa currently being propagated by Western media is all the more concerning as it adversely effects African development efforts.
African media itself, however, is certainly not immune from criticism of this sort.
Several initiatives have emerged, in recent years, to help improve the accuracy of African media.
The African Media Initiative and Media Monitoring Africa are just two examples.
Here is a summary of the gems, errors and other inaccuracies in global media coverage of Africa and in the African media itself:
Global media coverage of Africa
Canada - RDC: "Stephen Harper enters Africa's heart of darkness"
This was the title given to a CBC news article concerning the Canadian prime minister's visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during a summit of the International Organization of the Francophonie. Although the title refers to Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, it also evokes an outdated, condescending vision of black Africa as a savage, dangerous land.
The article adds:
It's the most wretched country on the face of the earth.
The article makes it seem as though prime minister Harper ought to be given a medal for his courage in visiting the DRC.
Israel - "Sub-Saharan Africans are not rapists"
Slate Afrique explains the context of this original (to say the least) headline :
Blacks are not rapists.
This is the message that asylum-seeks from sub-Saharan Africa want to make heard in Israel.
Israeli public opinion had been pointing the finger at sub-Saharan asylum-seekers after a highly publicized rape trial implicated four Eritreans.
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on 20 May that to counter the stigmatization of black people, a support center for foreign workers has been assisting Africans in preparing "open letters to the Israeli people".
France - Confusion between Guadeloupe and Madagascar for I-télé
The clashes in Guadeloupe between the Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon and security forces coincided with the most intense political crisis in Madagascar.
The two events were so close to each other in time, in fact, that I-télé (a cable-TV news channel in France) compiled the following little montage in which the commentary confuses the events in Guadeloupe with those in Madagascar :
USA - DRC: "Orphaned, raped and ignored"
This is the title of an article by journalist Nicholas Kristof about a 9 year-old child that was the victim of gang rape in the DRC.
As Laura Seay explains in a translation on Slate Afrique, this article raises several ethical issues :
After several forceful debates, Kristof posted a reply on his blog in which he promised not to do it again - all the while refuting criticism that he had endangered the child by identifying.
He recognized, however, that the publication of the child's name violated the policy of The Times, even if he received permission from a woman playing the role of the child's guardian.
It is difficult to imagine an editor in-chief that would have allowed for such a 'blunder' to occur in an article concerning a Western child-abuse victim.
African media
South Africa - Rape-victim indirectly identified in an October 2012 report
Musa Rikhotso reports that:
A story sourced from Sapa entitled, “Sentence Slashed over rape of Stepdaughter” (The Star, 10/10/2012, p.7).
The article names a Limpopo man, whose sentence was reduced from life imprisonment to 1- years for raping his 15-year-old stepdaughter; in so doing, failing to protect the identity of the rape victim.
Senegal - "Senegalese repatriated from the Ivory Coast"
During the height of the crisis in the Ivory Coast, the Walfadjiri-l'Aurore ran the headline "Senegalese repatriated from the Ivory Coast take it out on Wade":
Page 2 of a Senegalese daily containing an article about the crisis in the Ivory Coast- public domain
Le Post explains that this was an error because:
these men and women criticized the government precisely because they had not been "repatriated" but had been simply required to return by their own means.
Kenyan children are taught ethnic tolerance through science fiction: "Attack of the Shidas:AKAs Save the Planet” is the story of three communities who live in a desert town which depends on a lone borehole for all their water.
"Three children in the town discover they have special powers as only they, can see and hear the invisible water thieves that bring with them numerous other problems to the three communities.
Yet nobody believes what the children have to say, because these three children possess special powers of equality and tolerance that enable them to see what others in their communities cannot see.
Can the children stop the aliens before war breaks out in the town?"
Here is a perfect gift to salute the new year: our new e-book dedicated to Africa's Sub-Saharan region.
"African Voices of Hope and Change," gives you an intimate perspective into the stories and people of Sub-Saharan Africa through our best English-language posts from 2012.
From a total of about 800 posts produced over the year from the region, we hand-picked 13 posts to feature from Senegal, Uganda, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mauritania, Kenya, Angola and other countries.
You are welcome to download it here.
You can even send a copy (in PDF, ePub or Mobipocket format) to your relatives or friends across the world, maybe as a present for their donation to GV.
Most important, please spread the word in your global circles, social networks and anywhere you deem fit!
African Voices of Hope and Change is more evidence of the power of we', a collective effort focusing on places and people too often 'forgotten' by mainstream media worldwide, despite Africa’s diverse but promising growth in the upcoming years.
As stated in the ebook introduction, "At the start of the new millennium, it felt as though the African continent was essentially written off by the international community... recent statistics suggest that nine of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in Sub-Saharan Africa."
And while many experts actually believe that new technology's most lasting influence will be on a broadening field of education, "also important is the potential for leveraging technology towards a more general transparency and accountability, as shown by initiatives based on social and citizen media for monitoring local elections or making government data available on the Internet."
Aimed at providing a larger context and fostering the Global Voices mission, this collection of 2012 posts will try to parse out such complex framework and open up the horizon for the upcoming year.
These voices tell us about moving forward in hope and change, their accounts reveal a path infused with struggle and collaboration.

41 political prisoners bravely published a statement saying they witnessed signs of torture on Sattar's body.
Several international organizations including Reporters Without Borders urged the Iranian authorities to clarify the exact circumstances of the blogger's death and called on the international community not to allow the crime to go unpunished.
Beheshti's cyber-activism, including his personal blog apparently led to his brutal arrest, torture and eventual death at the age of 35.
His blog motto translated from Farsi reads: "Criticism.
Long Live Iranians and Iran.
My life for Iran."
His last post appears to have been on October 26.
He was arrested two days later.
In his final post he criticized Ali Larijani, head of the Iranian parliament.
He said that Larijani and the Islamic Republic are hypocrites to criticize other countries for human rights violations.
Beheshti wrote :
You talk about human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain... Western countries, just like you created heaven on earth in Iran.
No you did not.
If you had really created this heaven, why would you not ask people to come to Iran and see it?
Iranian netizens reacted to this "crime" that reminds us once more that bloggers can end up sacrificing their lives for their virtual activity.
A page was launched on Facebook with the title "Those who were responsible for the death of Sattar Beheshti should be on trial".

Three years ago, another blogger, Omid Reza Mir Sayafi died in an Iranian prison under suspicious circumstances.
Where is Milocas Pereira?
A question echoing through the blogosphere for a couple of weeks, but the response is slow in coming.
On social networks a movement sprung up to pressure Guinean authorities to investigate the disappearance, six months ago, of the journalist and university professor in the Angolan capital city Luanda, where she has lived since 2004.
On Facebook the group "SOS, STOP! – Queremos a Jornalista Milocas de volta" (We Want Journalist Milocas Back) already has 5,775 members.
Recently, the President of the Association of Community of Guinea-Bissau Immigrants in the United States, Celina Spencer, also launched a petition directed to the UN High Commission of Human Rights, to try and get support to locate the journalist.
She offered some interviews, analyzing some of the crises currently occurring within Guinea-Bissau.
Specifically, the Guinean government's role and presence of the Angolan military "Missang" deployed to Guinea-Bissau for military reformation .
It is unknown whether her disappearance is connected with the interviews or not.
It is certain however, she was assaulted by strangers.
Afterwards, feeling threatened in Luanda, she considered and confided to a friend that she desired to return back home.
In an interview with Angolan television, at the beginning of January, the professor spoke about the situation in Guinea-Bissau after the death of President Malam Bacai Sanhá.
After this, Milocas Pereira said that she began to feel under great pressure .
On last November 3, the Sindicato dos Jornalistas Angolanos (Union of Angolan Journalists) denounced that the Guinean journalist had been “terrorized” in Luanda:
Milocas Pereira was attacked in the beginning of the month of May by unknown people, before having communicated her intention to leave Angola to some people she had spoken with.
She pointed to this attack as the cause for this decision.
According to “Sol Mansi” Radio , the journalist had no doubts that the attack had strong political motivations:
She was running the risk of losing her life, and the only solution that she had was to immediately leave Angola, and return to her country.
Counselled by a friend to publicly denounce the attack, MP said she preferred not to.
Further counselled to go to Portugal, MP said she did not trust the Portuguese and said she would feel better in Guinea-Bissau with those responsible for the transition.
Last October, in statements to the same radio station, the Secretary of State for Communities in Guinea-Bissau, Idelfrides Gomes Fernandes confirmed the news about the possible disappearance of the journalist for the first time.
Four months after her mysterious disappearance, the family decided to contact authorities, but the only response that they got was silence.
In its November 2nd edition, the Novo Jornal (New Newspaper) (Angola) dedicated an entire page to the disappearance of the journalist.
Two months ago, Bartolomeu Capita of the National Movement of Cabinda wrote on the site of the organization Peace & collaborative development network that Milocas Pereira could have been ordered killed in Angola:
Nobody has seen Ms. Pereira or simply heard from her for almost a month now.
Yet she was teaching at the independent University of Angola.
Concerns have arisen which must be addressed.
More and more fellow scholars are discreetly suggesting that she may have been murdered, for having sought to investigate certain matters related to the obscure links between Angola's criminal regime and Guinea-Bissau.
News of the disappearance of the 58 year old journalist was made public at a time in which the family – that was trying not to complicate police investigations – began to lose hope that Milocas was still alive.
The brother of the professor, Carlos Pereira, who lives in Lisbon, said to Voice of America :
What comes to us is this, she has disappeared since the end of July.
We suspect a lot.
That she could have run into many things and needed to flee, hide or had some could of retaliation.
On the blog Rispito , the Guinean Samba Bari alleges that the disappearance is another challenge for the transitional authorities and that the situation could widen the fissure between the Guinean government not recognized by Luanda and the Angolan government.

Fifteen young journalists from six different countries have produced a series of personal stories about representatives of the minorities (in a broad sense) from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, and Macedonia.
The stories are available in English, German, and French on the Face the Balkans website.
A group of secondary school teachers broke into and entered the office of the Minister of Education in protest against the arbitrary transfer of 120 teachers to other schools.
The transfers were made to punish teachers who participated in last year's strikes demanding the improvement of the conditions of employees in the education sector.
The teachers considered this act a punishment for a strike they held to demand of their rights and also a violation of civil service law in Mauritania.
For his part, Mohamed Ould Rabani, Secretary General of the independent syndicate of secondary education teachers, slammed the transfer as a dangerous precedent in the history of Mauritania and asked his colleagues not to conform to the ministry's orders.
In the same context, another group of arbitrary transferred teachers, held a demonstration in front of the Education Minister Ahmed Ould Bah's office, denouncing the decision and demanding its immediate retreat.
Some of them also protested in front of the presidential palace in Nouakchott and threatened to resign from their posts in case the decision is not retracted.
It is worth mentioning that the ministry had suspended the salaries of hundreds of teachers after their participation in the strikes organized by the syndicate.
Photograph of the protesting teachers posted on Twitter by @mejdmr
The National Syndicate for Secondary Education issued a statement condemning the arbitrary transfer:
The Mauritanian Ministry of Education arbitrarily transferred dozens of secondary education teachers because of their participation in legitimate strikes which is considered a dangerous violation of the rights of syndicate members, especially the right to demonstrate, which is guaranteed by article 14 in the constitution and by the international agreements signed by our country, such as the the International Labor Convention number 87, which is related to syndicate freedoms.
Tiguend blog posts a testimony of one the teachers effected by the transfers, entitled "This is why I deserve the sanction" where he speaks of the injustice of that decision:
I have been teaching for 10 years in Trarza region and never during those years have I got less then 17 points on my evaluation.
I have worked with various directors and my salary has never been suspended except this time because of my participation in the strike.
I have no record of absence or slackening in my duties and everything is fine, thanks God, until the director Mohamed Ould el Talib came and sent a report to the Rousou School director to whom he reports, asking him to give me a 6/20 grade and to accuse me of snitching and gossip, which he has been bragging about since his illegal nomination as head of administration.
All this was a reason to transfer me arbitrarily along with 16 other teachers in Trarza whose only fault is to have taken part in the strike knowing that the law guarantees this right and the constitution protects it for a noble life and a more dignified education.
Mauritan.net says that the transfer is a result of a complaint, accusing the teachers of "inciting strikes and exercising politics":
The transfer of the teachers was based on directors reports via the governors and the letters of the governors' letters stated that they are inciting strikes and practicing politics.
Dedda Cheikh Brahim criticizes the way the Mauritanian regime is dealing with teacher's protests:
In the military democracy, protests are punishable and the teachers are now paying for it in a legal way
He adds:
The teachers were transferred after they decided to demand their rights.
There is God oh Mauritanian
Mauritanian journalist Mohamed Ould Salem also slammed the Minister of Education for creating a crisis in the education sector:
Ould Bah doesn't breathe ordinary Oxygen but lives from making crises and injustice.
This is why he decided to punish 108 of the best teachers because they participated in legal strikes.
He adds:
A new date with a year marked with a crisis in the education sector with 108 teachers refusing punitive transfer and education syndicates promising to make the decision fall and a minister who is very creative in making up crises and accumulating failure
Nasser Al Hachemi tweets:
It is humiliation and tyranny.
My heart with you oh you holders of the light
Activist Mejdi Ahmed also had his word about the matter:
The teachers protested yesterday in the Education Minister premises asking to renounce the decision of transferring them - a decision they judged unfair.
Al Cheikh Ould Horma also tweeted:
In Mauritania the teachers insist to ideologize the conflict with minister who in turn insists of ideologizing the teachers demand
<
The academic year is about to start in Mauritania and the battle starts again between the Minister and the syndicates.
A dire war
Once again an indigenous girl was killed after being brutally raped in Borodalupara village, Kawkhali Upazila of Rangamati district.
The victim, Khomaching Marma (14) was a student of class eight.
Her dead body was found in the slopes of a mountain just 200-300 yards away from her home.
She was last seen going to a nearby jungle to bring her family’s cattle back home.
Rina Dewan posted on her Facebook wall regarding the reason behind this heinous crime:
There is a settler village named Nallyachari Uttor Matha within half a kilometer of the place where Thomaching’s dead body was recovered.
During the early 1980s the government evicted the indigenous Marmas from their land and settled Bengalis there.
Now those settlers claim a large portion of Borodalupara as theirs.
A few days ago, some Marma villagers planted ginger in their lands but the settlers destroyed their crops and created unrest.
It has been learnt that conflict exists for land between the maternal uncle of Thomaching Marma and the Bengali settlers.
So, it is suspected that she was raped and killed to avenge.
Violence against indigenous women has increased in recent times.

Violence against indigenous women has increased in recent times.
A few months ago, another indigenous girl was raped and killed. She was a student of class five.
Hari kishore Chakma, a journalist, provides some statistics on the rape of indigenous women in an article at daily Prothom Alo :
Up to November of this year, 20 indigenous girls and women were raped in three hill districts.
Thomaching Marma’s name is now added to this ever-growing list.
In 2011, 10 indigenous women were raped.
Kapaeng, a human rights organization, reported this statistics.
According to this organization, 51 indigenous women were the victims of violence during this year.
This number was 31 in 2011 and just 4 in 2008.
This brutal rape and murder once again has spread anger and rage across the country.
Processions have been arranged in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet.
Netizen have also expressed their rage and protested.

Just like the numb, cold body of our sister, have we also become numb?
India protested vehemently against recent gang-rapes, Imphal cried out for justice against sexual harassment of a girl.
What should be our protests?
Only one procession?
Then becoming quiet and numb again!

The India government has been forced to arrest the perpetrators.
Recently an indigenous girl was raped and killed at Borodalupara village in Kawkhali upazila of Rangamati district. And?
The Police have failed to arrest even a single perpetrator!
Just like this, hundreds of our indigenous sisters and mothers have been becoming the victims of rapes and murders for a long time.

This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011.
After Bahrain's police “Slap” video went viral the Minister of Interior issued a statement in which he asked that "anyone who films such an event should report it immediately" to the authorities.
Two days later, and in contrast with such statements, many were shocked at the news of the arrest of a photojournalist.

Gaurav Mishra analyzes the dynamics of grassroots change movements and how they work to make an impact in the mainstream using social media.
As part of our collaboration with Syria Deeply we are cross-posting a series of articles that capture civilian voices caught in the crossfire, along with perspectives on the conflict from writers around the world.
Loubna Mrie paid a steep price for her place in Syria’s revolution.
As an Alawite who took a stand against President Bashar Al Assad, she pitted herself against her community; many Alawites have remained staunchly behind Assad, as the leader of their sect and the protector of their privileged position of power.
From the start of the uprising, Loubna’s parents took opposite sides: her father and uncles stood with Assad, while Loubna and her mother supported the growing protests.
It was a position Loubna’s father made it clear he wouldn’t tolerate: he demanded her loyalty to the Assad camp.
In August, Loubna left her hometown of Latakia, in western Syria, fleeing across the border to Turkey.
Her father kidnapped her mother and threatened to kill her as punishment.
When Loubna refused to return her father followed through on the threat.
Her father killed her mother, and cut her off from the life she had known before the uprising.
Loubna is now a filmmaker with Basma, a media activist group.
She travels around Syria with a camera, chronicling the revolution on film.
We met up with her in Gaziantep, Turkey, to talk about life and war in Syria.
Below is a portion of that chat.
SD: What was it like in Latakia at the beginning of the revolution?
Mrie: It started like every other city in Syria.
The demonstrations just had the normal, peaceful slogans like, “we want better schools”, “we want better jobs”, “we want democracy”.
We didn’t even say the line “al shaab yureed isqat al nizam”—“the people want the regime to fall”.
SD: Were there many Alawites protesting?
Mrie: No.
There were hardly any.
Latakia is full of Alawites, and most of them were supporting the regime.
We had just a small slice of society that was against the regime, but they didn’t go to demonstrations because they were so afraid.
From day one, the regime was trying to convince people that this is not a revolution-it’s just terrorists or an Islamic movement against you.
SD: When did it all happen?
When did your family fall apart?
Mrie: It happened last November.
It was so traumatic, I couldn’t even think about anything.
I felt guilt, huge guilt.
I kept crying for three days, but then I realized that my mom didn’t die just to see me crying in my bed the whole day. So I chose the other option: to grab my camera and go back to Syria.
SD: Did she speak to you in the final month?
Loubna
Mrie: No, they kidnapped her in the middle of August.
I didn’t hear from her again since then.
Even my aunts and my grandma didn’t call me because they were so afraid that if the government found out they were in touch with me, they would harm them.
Even my neighborhood and my old friends didn’t talk with me at all.
They didn’t say we are sorry, we feel sad, we feel anything.
They were saying that you deserve that.
So it’s not only the loss of my mom that broke my heart, it’s also the attitude of the people that I was growing up with.
SD: What was your father’s argument?
Mrie: I have no idea.
But maybe they were just convinced by these stories that the regime has been telling them: that this is an Islamic movement and they will kill you, and that you will lose everything.
I think that for the big families- my family is one of them—they are so afraid.
They know that when the regime will fall they will lose almost everything, because when the regime was in control they knew they could do anything and no one would punish them.
They could do all the stealing, the cheating, the robberies.
For me, I understand the rich families or the families that are in power, but I don’t understand the poor families who support Assad.
I remember my neighbors…they were so poor.
I’d wonder, why are you supporting this regime?
What did the regime do for you?
After a while we discovered it’s like a religious thing for them.
In the last years, it was Hafez Al Assad, and now it's Bashar Al Assad The people worship these guys.
Since the revolution began, I kept telling people that the protesters who are in the streets, the opposition, they are not monsters.
I fled to Turkey with the help of the Free Syrian Army.
They were so nice to me and they helped me.
They knew that I’m an Alawite, but they didn’t kill me as the government is always trying to say.
SD: Do you think they are changing their opinion at all?
Do you think the community is changing its opinion at all?
Mrie: Now they are stuck in the middle.
They are losing their children in battle.
They are losing their generation in the army.
So they know that the government is not making any good for them, but at the same time they are so afraid of the opposition.
We have Islamist elements in the revolution, and it makes them afraid.
They are in the middle. They know that the government is not helping them, but at the same time they are afraid of the opposition. I have been hearing stories about how, when the dead bodies come to the villages of the Alawites, all the village starts to curse Bashar Al Assad and curse his government because he’s not protecting them and they are sacrificing themselves for someone who is not making any efforts.
SD: From what we keep hearing, the regime has scared the Alawite community so much that they think it’s a battle for survival, life or their death.
How do you think that you can calm down those fears?
Mrie: The problem in this community is that they won’t understand.
All they know is that if you were an Alawite and you were against the regime, your punishment will be doubled.
If they just saw the stories and just turned on the TV and heard the slogans, they would know that this is not a revolution against them.
SD: Right now in the Alawite community, if somebody stands up, like you, and supports the revolution, what happens? Mrie: They would kill his mom. SD: They say that?
Mrie: No, but it happened to me.
I’m not a terrorist.
I didn’t do anything wrong.
I just stepped out from my small community and said that I am with the revolution, I am with my people.
I’m not going to witness all this bloodshed and keep quiet.
It’s not a political cause, it’s now a human cause…this is a revolution for us, for our children, for our grandchildren.
SD: The whole regime could change tomorrow.
Whenever it happens, how is this community going to react?
How is Syria going to change if you have so much fear within the Alawite community?
Mrie: Right now we have liberated areas.
There are Alawites in those liberated areas, so you can see samples of a new Syria, how it’s going to be. not killing the Alawites, they are not kicking them out of their houses.
We are all one.
We are just a good community.
Not because of Bashar Al Assad, because we are a peaceful people.
SD: There are some Alawites in the coalition, in the opposition.
Are they people that the larger Alawite community respects?
Are they people that can be leaders and help the community?
Mrie: The community hates the Alawites who are with Moaz al Khatib.
They say these are not even Alawites—they are outcasts.
Loubna I’m living the same situation myself.
They broke into my house.
They stole all my things.
They stole my papers from my college.
All I got from my Alawite community, who are supporters of the regime, was just bad words on Facebook.
SD: What did they say?
Mrie: That you deserved it and we wish that the same thing that happened to your mom will happen to you.
SD: There might always be some anger against the Alawites for standing behind Assad?
What does that mean for Syria?
Mrie: In Syria the shelling is still going on and everyday we have more dead people.
So we can’t really decide now the shape of the future Syria.
We know that revenge doesn’t build a country, doesn’t build democracy.
We went in the streets and made sacrifices to make a new country; revenge will not help us to do this.
But we will punish the people who did make mistakes, who killed.
Check out our regional reviews of Global Voices in 2012
As the year draws to a close, we’d like to express our gratitude for the hard work, creativity and care of so many in the Global Voices community.
2012 has been a year of tremendous growth and success for GV.
Some highlights:
Our community has nearly doubled in size - GV now has over 700 authors and 600 translators volunteering; as many as 700 people contribute in a given month.
Applicants for Rising Voices micro-grants in 2012 topped 1200, a nearly 50% increase over the 2011 figure.
This increase is a strong acknowledgement of the impact that citizen’s voices and media are having everywhere, even in places that face material and social constraints to online participation.
We hit a record number of visits in a single day - 157,000!
GV’s biannual summit, held this year in Nairobi, Kenya was an event of unparalleled participation and energy, and helped us to set the course for GV’s future.
GV Advocacy’s community has prospered, with new content, many new members, and a strong sense of purpose and mission going into 2013.
GV Advocacy enters 2013 with a new director, Hisham Almiraat, building on the strong foundation laid by Sami Ben Gharbia.
The addition of Amharic and Bulgarian in 2012 brought the number of languages represented in GV’s Lingua translation community to 35.
Additionally, as our multilingual newsroom grows, dozens of posts each month are originally written in languages other than English.
While the numbers may reflect the facts of Global Voices’ impacts, we really want to celebrate and thank the volunteers who together make GV such an energetic and trusting community. We wish we had room to post images of everybody, but there are so many of us! jQuery(document).ready(function($) { // The slider being synced must be initialized first $('#gallery-carousel-1').flexslider({ animation: "slide", controlNav: false, animationLoop: false, animationSpeed: 300, slideshow: false, itemWidth: 130, itemMargin: 0, asNavFor: '#gallery-slider-1' }); $('#gallery-slider-1').flexslider({ animation: "slide", // animation: "fade", // I want fade but it's broken :S controlNav: false, animationLoop: false, slideshow: false, sync: "#gallery-carousel-1" }); });

While countries around the world ushered in the New Year with fireworks and celebrations, a special line-up of treats from the authorities was awaiting Bahraini protesters.
To mark the beginning of the new year, the Bahrain News Agency published a statement to celebrate the achievements of the previous year, saying:
The Kingdom's impeccable human rights record and bright image remain intact and undistorted by any futile false allegations propagated by hostile megaphones at international functions.
At the same time, Bahrainis experienced New Year's day with many twists.
Luckily, some of them have been documented by netizens and found their way to the world wide web, showing the world "impeccable human rights record" and "false allegations" the government is talking about.
Blogger @chanadbh tweeted the link to a video and added a sarcastic comment:
The video shows a riot policeman throwing a brick at a parked car in the village of Jurdab.
Dr Abdulhadi Khalaf, an academic professor who was recently stripped of his Bahraini nationality, shared another video and commented:
@Abdulhadikhalaf: Ministry of Interior thugs try to break a door****is that why there are numerous injuries among thugs?
@AHRAR_MURQOBAN, a Twitter account dedicated to publishing news of a village in Sitra, published a video of a similar incident.
The police forces in this video seem to be speaking in Urdu:
@AHRAR_MURQOBAN: Mercenaries planning to raid a house - Sitra
The haziness in the video is not from fog - but as a result of the heavy teargas thrown on villages on a daily basis.
Human rights activist Maryam Alkhawaja also shared a video which shows police forces macing women - reportedly - for no apparent reason:
Twitter user Mahmood Alshaikh tweeted yet another video which shows that no good dead goes unpunished in Bahrain:
@M_Alshaikh: Bahrain - Sitra : Youth chased after trying to rescue a family from suffocation 2013 1 1
Last year, Physicians for Human Rights stated in their report Injured protesters whom PHR investigators examined suffered from blunt force trauma and lacerations to
the head, torso, and limbs due to the impact of metal canisters being fired at them by law enforcement officials at close range.
A clear example of that was tweeted by 14 Feb Media Network, a network specialized in publishing news of Bahrain, on New Year's Day: @Feb14Media: Bahrain | Manama : a straight shot hits a protester Another very similar and clearer video was posted earlier by the same network:
@Feb14Media:
Sitra - Sufala : a straight shot to the head of a protester 1/1/2013
Police forces must be trained not to discriminate, not even age discrimination as this small child (comments say he is four years old) was not excluded from the joy of celebrating New Year's - the Bahraini way.
Moawen explains:

Using its Twitter account, the Ministry of Interior issued a formal reply on the events of New Year's day, saying:
@moi_bahrain: Assistant Undersecretary of Legal Affairs: calls in websites to hold gatherings at 3:30PM on Tuesday in various areas in Bahrain are illegal
@moi_bahrain: Public gatherings &freedom of expression are protected by the constitution & those who want to benefit from such right should follow the law
@moi_bahrain: Security and legal procedures would be taken against lawbreakers to protect security
At the end of the statement mentioned at the beginning of this article, the Bahrain News Agency stated:
The Kingdom of Bahrain is confidently and surely heading towards the brightest future in 2013.
Personally I hope that will be true.

On 10 January, 2013 in Pakistan's southwestern city of Quetta, 82 people lost their lives in back-to-back bombings that hit an area populated primarily by ethnic Hazara Shia Muslims.
Irfan Khudi Ali, a prominent human rights activist who tirelessly highlighted the persecution of Hazara Shia in Pakistan, passed away in the second attack.
Vigil for @khudiali in Islamabad.
Picture by @ali_abbas_zaidi
On Twitter, Ali reported narrowly escaping the first bombing in Quetta:
@khudiali : #Quetta, was on the way to home nearly escaped from bomb blast 11 ppl dead.
Maria Memon tweeted:
Ali cldnt survive the 2nd blast tonite.RIP @khudiali RT @khudiali #Quetta,was on the way to home nearly escaped 4m bomb blast 11 ppl dead His killing has sparked a tribute to his struggle and reignited protests on Shia killings in Pakistan.
Being a minority within a minority, the killing of Hazara Shias is one of the most underreported cases of violence in Pakistan.
Hazara.net archives statistics of killings of Hazara Shiites in Pakistan, including number of attacks and the number of people killed in the attacks thus far.
According to the statistics on the site a total of 1100 Hazara Shiites have been killed in Pakistan since 1999. Media outlets often face the heat for not acknowledging the nature of the attacks and when they do they are criticized for using the term 'sectarian' when a particular sect is being targeted.
In an effort to create more noise and build pressure on law enforcement agencies and the government, there's been an active debate on social media regarding the targeted killings of Shiites using the #shiakillings and #shiagenocide on Twitter. Hazara activists have, in the past, used social media to get international media's attention in order to get their stories reported.
Well respected journalist Mohammad Hanif writes:
Daring of him.
Thank you from a #Shia. #Pakistan
@adyadeel: #ShiaGenocide must end. govt must take concrete steps to show that they r serious to save innocent Shia lives
Blogger Omar Biden wrote a brief yet moving tribute to Irfan Khudi Ali on his blog:
Yesterday was one of many blood-soaked days for Balochistan’s capital, Quetta.
Already in the morning the residents of city got to hear a blast pow, where explosives were planted in a Frontier Corp vehicle at Bacha Khan Chowk.
The explosion resulted in 12 innocent lives being perished.
Indeed, it created helter-skelter between the residents to bury the dead bodies.
Yet the more-then-enough rule doesn’t work in Pakistan, at least not in Quetta.
After an interval of only few hours Alamdar Road, a majorly Shia Hazara people territory, witnessed another mass massacre, still the same tactic as in the morning -bomb blast.
Nevertheless this time planned “Mardanawar”, boldly, a twin-blast to claim an unforgettable catastrophe (...)
he brutal incidents cost an enormous loss to humanity indeed.
It also happened to be the death of an admired friend, a human rights activist –Irfan Ali Khudi.
Allegedly, Irfan Ali Khudi, 33, had come to Quetta so that he could “deliver peace training to young activist”.
Although I intended to write my feelings, yet am leaving this post incomplete…
The blood soaked day in Quetta, as Omar puts it, is not the first of its kind and may not be the last one.
The indifference has angered many, especially since the banned militant organization, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, that claimed responsibility for the attacks are yet to be apprehended.
@sehartariq : Why do we feel more sympathy for Muslims in Gaza than we do for Muslims in #Pakistan with whom we share history & citizenship #shiagenocide
@zzzAsad : Shia pilgrims are frequently targeted on buses by sectarian militants #LeJ #ShiaGenocide @FahidJaved : You bloody #LeJ butchers, kil me #WeAreAllHazara.
How many bullets do u hv? @Naseer_Kakar : Latest on #Quetta: all the victims r shifted to military hospital as doctors were threatened by #LeJ in Civil Hospital.#Balochistan #blasts
@AhmadShuja : RIP @khudiali.
They took your life, but your courage and inspiration remains. #LeJ #Quetta
@ZakirChangezi : Quoting #KhudiAli "My people the Shia are dying.
If I die, I want to die trying to help them". #RIPKhudiAli
The families of the victims have refused to bury their dead and have announced that they will continue a sit-in unless the army takes action against the killing sprees.
This image uploaded on Twitter shows thousands of Hazara sitting in the rain with the dead bodies of those massacred in the Quetta bombings. @ammar_faheem : Shia protesters stage sit in on Quetta's alamdaar road along with bodies of those martyred in yesterday's blasts #ShiaGenocide
@AdnanSarparrah : Sit-in by the Shia community continues but handing over #Quetta to army won't solve anything, Quetta is already under control of Army (FC)
Ali spoke at Tedx event in Rawalpindi city just a few weeks ago, watch his powerful speech here.
Ali dedicated most of his life to highlighting the plight of Hazara, for those who knew him and even those who did not, he has become a symbol of the struggle for justice for the Hazara Community in Pakistan.
As the sit in continues, amid cold and rain, as families refuse to bury their loved ones, will the authorities finally take action to stop the bloodshed?
Till then Ali's story needs to be heard.
Samia Al-Agbhari..a Yemeni writer facing a propaganda attack.
Photo shared by Afrah Nasser on Facebook
On Facebook, Yemeni blogger Afrah Nasser tackles the issue of restricting freedom of expression in her country and how a female writer is being harassed - allegedly for her disrespect of religion.
She writes:
Restricting freedom of expression in Yemen continue.
Another writer in Yemen is facing a severe attack; slandering her and accusing her of disrespecting religion.
One of the best female writers in Yemen, Samia AL-agbhari is facing a media propaganda attack and threatened for her brave stance.
I don't just agree with her statement, she has also my greatest solidarity.
I'm sure she will stand firm and solid, but I'm concerned about her safety afterwards.
Almost this time of the year, last year, Boushra al-Maqtary faced and still faces the same issue.
As I met Boushra one month ago, I can firmly say, the more those frantic religious figures fight writers, the more determined and stronger we be.
True writers are worriers.
When will they get it!
Recently a lively debate has been ignited in Brazil after the country's Ministry of External Relations, known as Itamaraty, issued two diplomatic passports to the heads of the evangelical Igreja Mundial do Poder de Deus (World Church of the Power of God) pastor Valdemiro Santiago de Oliveira and his wife Franciléia de Castro Gomes de Oliveira.
The concession of diplomatic passports is regulated in Brazil by constitutional Decree 5.978 which determines that these official documents can be issued to presidents, vice- presidents, ministers, congressmen, heads of diplomatic missions, ministers of the supreme court and former presidents.
However, diplomatic passports have also been traditionally conceded to representatives of the Catholic Church, based on the interpretation of Article 6, Paragraph 3:
Photo of Pastor Valdemiro Santiago from his public Facebook page
...to people who, although not listed in this article, need to attain it while fulfilling a role of interest for the country.
Although, as mentioned above, Catholic Church cardinals have benefited from this concession, other religious institutions recognized by the Brazilian state are not excluded from the application for diplomatic passports and indeed other evangelical representatives, such as controversial pastor Edir Macêdo, leader of Brazil's Igreja Universal (Universal Church) have received diplomatic passports in the past.
Thanks to the visibility drawn by the media to this particular case though, the Itamaraty has fallen under heavy criticism by the online community for its decision, sparking a discussion on the institution's power and on the violation of the very notion of secularism enshrined in Brazil's constitution.
A reader of the Folha de São Paulo newspaper, Renato Khair, posted the following comment in response to an article covering the case:
Is is unacceptable that a government makes use of the Itamaraty to concede diplomatic passports to the World Church.
It is an aberration that people who do not fulfill the legal requirements get to receive diplomatic passports, such as the sons of former President Lula, the Reverends in question and many others.
What’s being done to the Ministry of External Relations is demoralizing institutions that were considered respectable and serious.
Blogger Parsifal Pontes also criticized the issuing of diplomatic passports by emphasizing:
The way in which our ministry takes for granted the concession of diplomatic passports will soon lead foreign customs officials to burst into laughter when they see yet another one.

On Twitter, under #estadolaicoja (secular state now) the general consensus is that the Brazilian state has gone overboard by violating the basic rules of secularism that it is meant to uphold.
Lawyer Thiago G. Viana (@thiago_fiago), who blogs with Comendo o Fruto Proibido, tweeted:
Legality, equality, morality and secularism: these are the “only” principles violated by the special passports for pastors.
Public prosecutor Chico (@chiconob) continues along the same line of thought:
There is simply no plausible argument to concede a diplomatic passport to religious representatives.
How embarrassing!
The discussion online brings to light an old and ongoing debate regarding secularism in the Brazilian state.
Although the constitution affirms the independence of State and religion, in practice the concession of diplomatic passports to religious leaders appears to violate this principal, after all, how can a religious leader carry a diplomatic passport without infringing the basic principal of secularism?
A representative who carries an official privileged diplomatic pass should not, at any time, harbor a religious flag, let alone preach his/hers religious beliefs on foreign soil.
Djamil Ahmat reports that Chadian president Déby named his son Mahamat Idriss Déby, 24, general of brigade along with 4 other officers.
Tchadanthopus adds that his other son Zackaria Idriss Deby was allegedly offered to be vice-president with executive power when his father is out of the country.
Air pollution has been a public enemy to millions of Iranians for years.
It is no longer surprising news when the government some days shuts down public institutions due to air pollution.
Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health declared that last year more than 4,400 people lost their lives because of air pollution in Tehran, Iran's capital.
Dusty Tehran
There are several cartoons that have been shared with Iranian netizens about Tehran's pollution.
Omid drew a cartoon on Iroon.com to show dusty Tehran.

Mana Neyastani did not forget politics in his cartoon on pollution: "Grandfather" says "It's morning again, and I should wake up... all this bad news...executions, prison..."
"Grandfather" takes a deep breath to start his day and falls down beside a journal with the headline: "Deadly pollution of Tehran's air"

Here is a video showing a dark polluted Tehran at noon as an airplane lands in Mehrabad's airport.
No Oxygen
Zeyton, an Iranian blogger, says :
We used to say there is no place to breathe in this country.
By saying this we referred to political and social repression by the regime.
But now there is literally no oxygen to breathe.
A regime which can not provide oxygen for its citizens claim to export its way of governing to the whole world.
We should not forget that people in many other cities in Iran have become the victims of pollution too, such as the southern city Ahwaz .
Three protesters were arrested Wednesday night when students occupied a Budapest bridge.
The grassroots student union HaHa confirmed they were students moderating a forum held on the Chain Bridge.
Dozens of protesters waited at a Budapest police department for their release until 2 AM on Thursday.
The students were released after a civil infraction proceeding, receiving a formal warning.
On Wednesday, high school and university students protested in Hungary against the cut-backs in higher education admission quotas; at many high schools, students held sit-in strikes, observed minutes of silence and protested for their future.
X Communications Centre (XKK) published a map and list of the events; below is a screenshot:
The day of the protests in Budapest ended with two student events' participants marching to the Chain Bridge, where they held a forum, inviting the Minister of Human Resources and the Prime Minister to guarantee that the students' demands are met.
When the protesters started to leave the bridge the police accompanying the march arrested three students who had earlier moderated the conversations with megaphones.

Although they were released a few hours later many netizens pointed at the ‘fun fact’ that the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had once also been arrested for fighting for democratic rights at the time of Hungary's transition to democracy.
One Million for the Freedom of Press in Hungary, also known as Milla, shared this meme using a photo of Orbán being arrested in 1988 and the photo of one of the students arrested now:
The Hungarian government seemed to be willing to comply with the students' demands, as on Wednesday at noon it was announced that the 2013 undergraduate admission quota for tuition-free higher education would be set back to 55,000 students instead of the 10,480 published before the protests.
Students made clear on many platforms that they were aware of the need to roll out tuition fees in the Hungarian higher education, but they stressed that the fast-pace decision-making was not professional and the restructuring of Hungarian higher education needed a thorough preparation.
HaHa demanded that the government make decisions with the involvement of all stakeholders and come up with a better financial plan to ensure the sustainability of universities after the quotas are set back to a higher level.
A government spokesman said on Wednesday that the admission point requirements would be published before Christmas .
Admission points are calculated for each high school student on the basis of their grades, final exams and other obtained qualifications.
On Thursday afternoon, however, the Ministry of Human Resources announced they wouldn't publish the requirements this year.
Adult education, applied economic studies, communication and media studies, human resources studies, international economics and law are still not the government's favorites; there would be no tuition-free slots allocated for them.
The Three Kings came and went, but not before passing through New York City to celebrate with hundreds of children that came out for the parade organized by the Museo del Barrio on January 4, an atypically sunny Friday for the month.
This Christmas celebration, whose historic and religious background is quite complex (much like Christianity itself), has been a part of the Caribbean and Latin American cultural traditions for numerous centuries.
In Puerto Rico, for example, on the eve of the Three Kings' visit, children leave grass in a shoebox for the horses of Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltasar, thanking them for the gifts they will receive the next day.
In fact, this tradition has transformed over the years in a very creative way.
As such, the kings arrive on horseback, not on camels, and are celebrated with promises carved by santeros (artisans of religious images) that are a source of inspiration and joy.
Without a doubt, the Puerto Rican and Latin American communities that are alive and vibrant in the metropolis that is New York have not stopped celebrating this day with much excitement, especially the children.
So much so that the streets of East Harlem were paralyzed to see the passing of the carriages, the magi on stilts, Peruvian dances, capoeira, giant puppets and even two camels that live in a sanctuary in New Jersey.
Here we share a series of photographs taken by Puerto Rican artist Josué Guarionex that show some of the faces he managed to capture amidst all the commotion.
Jesús "Papoleto" Melendez, a poet born and raised in East Harlem, was chosen to be the emeritus king at the parade.
Dancers performing to traditional Peruvian music.
Osvaldo Gómez delighted us with his beautiful presence.
We can almost feel the energy of this band in this photo.
Hundreds of boys and girls with their paper crowns from 106th to 116th Street and Park Avenue.
Distinguished reporter, María Hinojosa, and activist, Angie Rivera, were chosen as the queens for this event.
Fátima Shama, commissioner for the New York Office of Immigrant Affairs, was chosen as one of the queens as well.
Tanya Torres, a Puerto Rican artist residing in East Harlem, was one of the godmothers at the parade, Nadema Agard, Cecilia Gastón, Christine Licata and Sandra Morales-De León.
Walking along the streets of New York with so many children is a tremendous gift.
"How Are You in Bamako ?"
Tree trunks laying on the road seem to have triggered the stampede that killed 60 and injured 49 during a new year celebration in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.
The fact that the area was not adequately lighted may have contributed to the terrible tragedy.
Israel Yoroba in Abidjan reports on a lethal stampede as people gathered to watch fireworks at the Plateau district to ring in the new year.
A hashtag #drameplateau was set up to give real time updates and on how one can help the victims.
This is the third disaster of this kind since 2009 in Côte d'Ivoire.

On Sunday, February 24, 2013 tens of thousands of Bulgarians protested against corruption, high utility bills and poverty.
The coastal city of Varna was declared the Protest Capital: over 40,000 people turned up for the Sunday's rally there.
Some 15,000 people protested in Plovdiv.
While it is difficult to determine the exact number of the February 24 protesters, activist sources say there were more than 200,000 of them nationwide.
In Sofia, the slogans included: "Let's Set the Monopolies on Fire!"; "Balkans, wake up!
For a real democracy!"; "End to illusions, civil action every day!"; "We, Bulgarians, Turks, Roma, Armenians - we are all #Bulgaria-n citizens!
We must stand up against political manipulation!" The Feb.
24 protest in Sofia.

Here's a video from the protest in Sofia, filmed by the author of this post:
The protest in Sofia coincided with the enthronement ceremony for Neofit, the newly-elected Patriarch of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church; the city was paralyzed, no public transport, except for the metro, was running.
Minutes after he was officially enthroned, Patriarch Neofit vowed to pray for peace and unity of the Bulgarian people.
This gesture of support for the protesters was well-received by them, while President Rosen Pleveliev, who addressed the crowd in Sofia, was booed.
The protesters called political parties not to manipulate or get involved in the protests.
At the rally in Veliko Tarnovo, they even chased some political representatives away .
Stanislava Stefanova wrote :
Don't they understand that there is no place for them at the protest of the people????
Isn't it clear enough that we don't want them???
Following the surprise resignation of Boyko Borisov's government on February 20, which came after an earlier protest turned violent, activists of the protest movement held a meeting in the city of Sliven and agreed on a list of demands: not to adjourn the Parliament; the President should appoint experts to the new government, instead of making it a caretaker one; to draft a Civil Participation Bill providing a 50% civil quota in all institutions; to return 51% of the energy sector shares to the State; to close the Bulgarian Energy Holding, BEH, for draining the energy sector; to summon the Grand National Assembly, establishing a procedure to recall MPs.
Lada Dimitrova wrote in a comment at the February 24 protest photo gallery on the "Saprotiva" ("Resistance") page:
I'm not concerned with who will be the leader, it is important for me to live in dignity!
Costa Ricans immediately tweeted about the 7.6 (Mercalli) earthquake that shook the country at 8:42 am on September 5, 2012.
The quake, with an epicenter in the Guanacaste area, was felt strongly in nearby Liberia and also in San Jose.
Twitter users are also reporting that the earthquake was quite long.
Citizens are using the hashtags #temblorcr and #terremotocr.
As Ariel Arburola (@arielarburola) tweeted:
On Sunday, February 17, tens of thousands of people in Bulgaria's capital Sofia and other cities continued to protest against high electricity and heating bills, and against the monopoly of energy distribution companies - ChCEZ, EVN, and Energo-Pro.
The protesters are demanding the nationalization of Bulgaria's three power utilities – CEZ, EVN, and Energo-Pro, with the National Electric Company NEK.
More than 20,000 people showed up for the protest in Varna, 10,000 in Plovdiv, 6,000 in Sofia, 5,000 in Blagoevgrad.
Four people were detained as protesters in downtown Sofia clashed with police who tried to cut the rally heading for the headquarters of power utility company CEZ.
The protesters want their demands met next week - and, if this does not happen, they are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister and the President.
Although nationalist parties tried to gain political advantage, protesters stood up against such manipulation, shouting "No parties!"
Bulgarian blogger Kostadin Kostadinov posted an entry titled "Where to after the revolt?":
Around 100,000 people protested today across the country.
The protests, which began as a reaction against the pompous arrogant and brusque bills, become more social and political.
People chanted "Boyko out" and "Down with ," and then wondered who would follow them.
What those 100,000, many of them young people, would do in the elections this summer is extremely important.
Obviously, they have the potential to awake the sleeping Bulgaria and to make Bulgarians believe in themselves and change their country.
On the other hand, they do not trust anyone, and they have a good reason.
Bulgarian blogger Sabina Panayotova expressed her pessimism about the Feb. 17 protests :
These people are not those people.
- People in are not those of today.
The people today were sad, desperate and gray.
- Protests today were like , except that afterwards they will likely bring communists back to power.
- Whatever happens after these protests will not be good.
In the best case, it will remain as it is.
Taralezh ("Hedgehog") blog commented on the missing responses from the ruling party and ministries:
The first men of the country ran away from the protests and the people's "love."
While hundreds of thousands chanted in the streets of 35 cities in the country, none of the leaders thought of returning to Sofia to stand in front of the citizens as men.
D-r Beloliki blog posted a collection of photos of the Feb. 17 protests across Bulgaria.
Dimi Lazhov posted photos from the northwestern city of Vratza where people protesting against the monopoly and the new "rain tax."
Facebook page Saprotiva ("Resistance") has photos from the nationwide demonstrations as well, and there is also a Storify collection with reactions, here.
Bulgarian journalist Adelina Martini tweeted:
Thousands protest in various cities in #Bulgaria against high electricity prices, shouting "mafia" and "resignation", local media report
Another Bulgarian journalist, Mariya Petkova, who is based in Cairo, tweeted about the protests, too:
Hundreds of thousands are out in the streets across #Bulgaria protesting private monopolies of utilities and economic hardship!!!

Consequences of war on Syrian children:
An estimated 4,355 Syrian children have been killed (up to 15/1/2013) in the on-going conflict in Syria, according to latest report released by Martyrs of the Syrian Revolution Database.
Thousands more have been wounded, detained, or left without family, or access to medical aid and humanitarian assistance.
According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 650,764 Syrian refugees are registered or awaiting registration inside and outside Syria.
More than half of them (52%) are under 18.
However, countless Syrian children have been confronted with the anguish of losing their home, their belongings, and parents.
The Children's Rights Portal reports:
Syrian Children in Crisis, bitter winter adds to suffering.
Source: Save the Children
In such conditions, practically all the necessary constants for child development are seriously disrupted, and the psychological damages of armed conflicts are incalculable.... These children, unable to grow up in an atmosphere of trust and having had to face atrocities from a very young age, often develop the conviction that violence is a way like any other to solve disputes, and so it is difficult for them to send a message of peace and international security to future generations.

Malawi's president is beating back calls for her to resign after hundreds of thousands of civil servants demanding a wage increase went on a two-week long strike, shuttering the country's international airport and paralyzing hospitals and schools.
Public sector workers had asked for a 65 percent wage increase to combat a rising cost of living sparked by President Joyce Banda's tough economic reforms, including a devaluation of the local kwacha currency.
During the nationwide strike, schools were closed and health centers were left with bare-bones staff as doctors, nurses, teachers, and other civil servants walked off the job.
The country's finance minister had said earlier that the striking workers' demand, which would nearly triple the government's wage bill from 97 billion kwacha to 276 billion kwacha , was impossible.
But officials bowed to workers' demands and agreed on a 61 percent wage increase on February 21, 2013.
The ordeal has not helped Banda, who is up for re-election next year.
The country's first female president, who inherited a crumbling economy from her late predecessor Bingu wa Mutharika, has increasingly drawn ire at home for implementing austerity budgets and other painful economic reforms in part to please the international community, whose aid accounts for about 40 percent of Malawi's budget.
A further blow to Banda's government were the remarks of Malawi's Minister of Economic Planning and Development Goodall Gondwe, published on the eve of the strike, accusing his fellow countrymen of being lazy.

Blogger Alick Ponje wrote that Banda has broken the public's trust:
The truth is we are being led by a president that isn't giving us enough opportunity to express ourselves.
She must guess what we want and act on the guess even if she hasn't divined it.
That’s pretty dangerous.
We are being tried by our own president and our voices are subdued in the immense power that she all of a sudden wields.
At the beginning of her really glorious times, hoodwinked us into believing she is a listening president who would always be at our beck and call.
She had to in order to have a nice start, with all the deserved support.
But blogger Pearson Nkhoma argued that demanding Banda's resignation or impeachment wouldn't solve the problem because parliament would remain populated with members who supported former President Mutharika, who brought Malawi into its current economic mess:
We want to paint a picture that has miserably failed.
Indeed, she may have failed, but we are the people who clapped hands at the 'achievements' of Bingu wa Mutharika when others were wailing night and day, saying that Bingu, the autocrat was failing Malawi; that Bingu was taking the country into oblivion where it could be impossible to save.
Now is having problems in taking the country from the hades of destructions.
We, who are calling for the head of , are to a larger extent to blame for this mess.
Pointing to the clear divide between the ruling class and everyone else, blogger Alick Nyasulu wrote in a post that appeared in The Nation newspaper that the government is not fulfilling the social contract that it holds with the Malawian people:
The spirit of entrepreneurism is vivid and well sunk in the average person that is not abusing the privilege of being in control of tax payers money.
I don’t think anyone should preach success simply because they have had a privileged position of allocating themselves undue wealth at the expense of public trust.
Unless we stop, doubtful in contemporary circumstances, elected public figures and their surrogates from stealing public funds, all talk about raising living standards is nothing but old colonial school colonial talk under the skin of the guy next door.
We are not lazy but deserve more.
Blogger Watipaso Mkandawire, writing that every class in Malawian society from top to bottom fails to do what is expected of them, called on civil servants to increase their productivity now that they have won a wage increase.
Maybe this will encourage Banda's administration to honour its promises to the people when it comes to the country's plan for economic recovery, but probably not, he wrote:
Of course the reality is that this is plain psychological.
Malawi's economy is in bad shape and there is "organised chaos" among those that are trying to implement the Economic Recovery Plan. They have a contract with Malawians, but they don't intend to honour that contract because simply it is not in their nature and they don't care.
Shia solidarity protests held in over a hundred cities across Pakistan have finally concluded.
They were triggered after bombings killed more than 100 people of the Hazara Shia community in the southwestern city of Quetta on January 10, 2013.
The bombings marked one of the goriest days in the history of Pakistan's southwestern province Balochistan.
Members of the banned militant group Laskher-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the horrendous crime.
Following the attacks, members of Quetta's Hazara community gathered on Alamdar Road and started their peaceful sit-in.
As images of them sitting in icy rain along with the coffins of their relatives, spread across social media, solidarity protests in form of peaceful sit-ins spread like fire across the whole country.
Pakistanis from all sects and tribes joined hands to condemn terrorism in the name of Islam.
Protesters in Quetta had a single-point agenda:
"Put Quetta city under the control of Pakistan Army and invoke Governor's Rule."
It took the government four days to sort out this matter; finally, signalling an end to the four-day long peaceful sit-ins.
Moreover, the relatives had refused to bury the dead bodies of their loved ones until their demands are met.
As the protest has concluded, the victims are now being buried.
Citizens organized sit-ins across the whole landscape of Pakistan.
Protests took place on main railways lines and also on highways.
According to reports, sit-ins were registered in more than 100 cities and towns.
Sit-ins were organized even in Skardu city, where the night temperature was -14 Celsius.
The goal was simple:
Accept the demands of the protesters in Quetta.
What follows is a pictorial view of some of the protests in major cities of Pakistan:

Ousmane Gueye on the site Mondoblog writes about the slow deployment of African troops in northern Mali :
If we were to judge the impact of the intervention in Mali by the jubilant euphoria of liberated populations, then it should be obvious that by deploying so slowly, African countries failed Mali once again ..... All the posturing by African heads of state and yet they could not achieve a single action of their own to slow down the Islamists in Mali.
Myanmar's decision to dissolve its notorious censorship board was praised by many groups as a step forward in promoting media freedom in the country.
But press freedom watchdogs also highlighted the continuing threats, difficulties and attacks experienced by Myanmar-based journalists throughout the past year.
For example, independent reporters continue to face a high risk of being slapped with various lawsuits if they expose controversies in the bureaucracy or criticize high ranking government officials.
On February 7, 2013, Myanmar parliament has formed a commission to investigate the writer behind the internet blog post titled “Above the Law” .
The post was written by someone who used the pseudonym “Dr. Sate Phwar” in the blog Voice of Myanmar .
The article accused members of parliament of disregarding the constitution and also for making decisions on their own without regarding the president's remarks.
He labeled the photo: Hired comment writers or military students?
Hired comment writers, lobbying the fight between the president Thein Sein and Vice-senior General Min Aung Hlaing by writing hate comments under the posts of the Eleven Media, the Voice Weekly and 7 Days News journal.
There are mixed views on the photo.
Steven Myo commented
the writers also include those who have learned in Russia.
La Min Aung refuted the allegation:
this is wrong, using the photos of the students of the military academy to mislead is not good.
This is to divide the people and the army.
Although it is hard to say whether it is true or not, hate comments using vulgar language are very common on Facebook in Myanmar.
Blogger Claudio Silva argues on Africa Is a Country that a deeper look at state-sponsored violence (urban evictions and crackdowns on protest) is needed to put into perspective two viral videos that recently shocked the country (see Global Voices coverage).
He writes "the violence in Angola comes from the very top: the State".
Drop by drop, the Shahbag intersection in Bangladesh's capital city Dhaka has become an ocean of people, demanding justice for atrocities committed during the country's 1971 liberation war and death penalty for war criminals.
According to some estimates as many as 500,000 people are at Shahbag.
Ten days ago, the Bloggers and Online Activists Network (BOAN) called for protests after the Secretary General of Bangladesh's Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami Abdul Quader Mollah was found guilty of war crimes committed during 1971.
He was sentenced to life in prison on 344 counts of murder, rape and arson by the International Crimes Tribunal on 5 February 2013.
Since Bangladesh's law allows death by hanging for heinous crimes, most people expected Quader Mollah to be taken to the gallows.
When he wasn't they took to the streets and to Facebook.

Popular poet and a professor of Jahangirnagar University Khaled Hossain hopes for success of the Shahbag movement.
He writes on his Facebook wall:
This awakening is not from greed or material profit.
This is an aesthetic outcome of collective positive thoughts.
We have nothing to gain except victory.
Blogger, writer and teacher Moom Rahaman calls everyone to join in at the Shahbag intersection:
Those youth who are in the city and have not managed to come to Shahbag, please know that you are far away from history, away from the present and future.
Still you have time to come besides us.
Those who are young, this is the right time to go to Shahbag.
Tausif Hamim is a youth who is staying overnight to show solidarity to the protests.
Vaskar Abedin shares Hamim's status:
I go to Shahbag three times aday, shout slogans, when I am tired, I scratch my head, look around, see with wonder that the lamp posts have become hanging posts.
Quader Mollah's effigy is hanging in that post.
I learn new words - S for Saka Chowdhury, You are Razakar, G for Golam Azam, You are Razakar.
When I am hungry, I come back home, eat my lunch and go back to Shahbag.
The evening rolls in, the slogans get intense, as it becomes dark the burning torches smells like retribution, I collect all the used torches, put paper on the spilled kerosene, become more tired, eat peanuts and burn the peanut shells with burning candles.

A number of private TV channels are broadcasting these ongoing protests.
Because of these broadcasts, Lucky Akter, a leading protester has become popular for her fiery slogans.
British-Bangladeshi Morshed Akhter writes:
From today Lucky Akter is my sister.
And in this way Lucky Akters become our sisters, "next to kin".
Lot of love for you.
Shimul Bashar, a reporter of a private TV channel has hopes for the #Shahbag protests:
I reiterate that these days of Shahbag will be part of history.
I do not have anything greater than this in my life.
Mama, i can't sleep.
I keep thinking about Shahbag.
I remember the faces.
Many people across the board have supported the cause but Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus is keeping mum so far.
Azad Master noticed this:
Non-Nobel Dr. Zafar Iqbal has came to the podium with his wife to shout slogans.
But Nobel Laureate Dr. Yunus is keeping mum this time also.

Saikat Shuvro Aic questions Bangladesh Nationalist Party's (the largest opposition party) - position on the ongoing protests:
Oh BNP!
The do not have voice, or foresight!
Oh God, please save this party.
Many think that the protests are government supported.
Others think that this shows a failure of the government.
But Bijoy Mazumdar does not agree:
In politics, there is no scope to misunderstand what people want.
The people politics is for the people.
The peoples' politics is against injustice, repression and oppression.
The peoples' politics is not for power, to free the power from corruption.
Those who are protesting in Shahbag, they are not doing it to empower any party.
Their fight is to establish justice.
This protest in the awakening of the younger generation
Some are thinking that this protest is a ploy of the ruling party to hide their failures in different areas.
I have a different answer.
Those who are uniting and asking justice for a 42 year old crime, one day the same crowd will be vocal against those who are doing rampant corruption.
This is the same crowd that become vocal in 1971 and clinched our freedom.
In 2013 the same crowd has erupted, with a different purpose, for justice.
Every day, new Facebook accounts are being opened for and against the movement.
Those for the protests include Shahbag Movement and Projonmo Square and those against are Voice of Nationalist and Bamboo Castle.
The protesters have vowed to keep Shahbag occupied till their demands are met.
If every community views global events though a lens of its choosing, then for the Russian Internet community the lens of choice is domestic politics.
It comes as no surprise, then, that the news that Pope Benedict XIV resigned from his post was interpreted from this angle by Russian bloggers.
Without any real interest in the repercussions of Benedict's resignation for the Catholic faith or what it means in light of ever more visible priest molestation scandals, the RuNet defaulted to its favorite pastime, humor.
Blogger and journalist Ivan Davydov took a social welfare angle :
In Russia a third of the families have been abandoned by fathers .
And nothing, no one is making noise in the press.
RuNet's pro-government bad boy Politrash exploited growing tensions in the North Caucasus:
Benedict XVI: "The leadership of the football club "Anzhi" made me an offer I could not refuse.
FC Anzhi is based in Makhachkala, the Republic of Dagestan, and is owned by Russian billionaire Suleyman Kerimov, who since 2011 has been spending reams of cash to poach good players from European clubs like FC Milan.
While Benedict XVI is retiring, President Putin still has some juice left.

Most bloggers, however, went with the transparent Vladimir Putin parallel.
There is some symmetry in comparing the authoritarian Putin to the Pope.
Both run organizations defined by "power verticals", although it was a different Russian leader who is said to have famously queried "The Pope?
How many divisions has he got?"
Ksenia Sobchak summed up the general sentiment in a tweet , hinting at the dubious constitutionality of Putin's third term:
Even the pope left.
On his own.
In the theocratic nation of Vatican the principle of transition of power works better than in the country of "sovereign democracy" ...
The fake Twitter account of Rossneft president Igor Sechin implied that the Pope may have had ulterior motives in resigning:
The Roman Pope Benedict XVI is cheerfully trolling Putin
The fake Twitter account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the presumed "hint" from Benedict for Putin to bow out, with a fake quote from Putin's press-secretary:
"Not a chance!" - Dmitry Peskov tersely commented on the latest news from Vatican.

A protester saying "No Harassment" by "Mauritania Today" on Facebook.
On Tuesday February 12, 2013, a group of Mauritanian activists staged a protest in front of the Egyptian Embassy in Nouakchott, the Mauritanian capital, against sexual harassment and rape which Egyptian women are being subject to in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
The event was organized by "Etkelmi" (Speak up in Arabic) , an NGO fighting against rape in Mauritania.
Mekfoula Brahim salutes all those who took part in it :
DemVybor activists in the regional city of Voronezh reported on the DemVybor blog that local NGOs are being audited by the city prosecutor's office.
The four organizations being targeted are all members of the Human Rights House of Voronezh : they are the Youth Human Rights Movement, the Inter-regional Human Rights Group, the ECOSOCIS Fund, and the Center for the Development of Public Initiatives.
Article20.org , a human rights news network has published a PDF scan of the prosecutor's request for information from ECOSOCIS.
The request reads:
The regional prosecutor's office, at the request of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, is conducting an audit of efforts to abide by legislation on NGOs and countering extremism.
Voronezh Prosecutor's Office letterhead.
Screenshot, April 7, 2013.
The type of information requested is essentially all financial and administrative documents, including, of course, the money received by the organization from abroad.
The new legislation is ostensibly designed to make such foreign funding more transparent.
Some say, however, that it is aimed at stopping the flow of foreign money to Russian NGOs altogether.
More interestingly, the prosecutor is asking for specific information regarding the group's public activities, a generic question that seems to be aimed at the "anti-extremist" portion of the law, but at the same time reads like the instructions for a grantee undergoing performance review by its fund:
15) information on mass public events (rallies, demonstrations, marches, pickets, meetings) organized and conducted by the organization, as well as mass events that the organization has taken part in.
Give a brief analysis of the mass events, their goals, and the results of holding them.
Perhaps the Voronezh prosecutor's office simply wants to get local NGOs to review how well they are addressing their mission statements!
It's likely that after submitting all the required documents, the NGOs in question will have a much better idea of their own cost-effectiveness.
That's, of course, if they don't get shut down first.
In a few days, Venezuelan voters will head to the polls for the second time in six months.
The country’s political climate is no less chaotic than it was during the election in October, however a group of NGOs have been able to come together to work towards transparency in the electoral process.
It is precisely the hyper polarized political environment in Venezuela that makes this collaboration worth noting.
Elección Ciudadana - the name for the umbrella group - emerged in October through the efforts of Venezuela Inteligente , and has used the last five months to develop partnerships with a wider range of organizations.
With these additional relationships, the organizations hope to be able to reach a wider audience of citizens.
As a representative of one of coalition member, Transparencia Venezuela , said:
our goal is to place at the service of the population as many forms of contact as possible so they can make their complaints using the mechanism that suits them best, both during the campaign that begins tomorrow and the day of the elections.
Transparencia Venezuela (@NoMasGuiso) also tweeted :
Are the efforts to reach more Venezuelans with the simple message that they can both access and add to information about electoral malfeasance working?
One coalition member, Usted Abusó, has received over 200 reports in 2013 which are largely about the political use of state resources.
Elección ciudadana map
Nearly 200 reports have been channeled thus far to Elección Ciudadana, which provides a map that pulls in citizen reports that were originally sent to collaborating organizations.
Its team expects to receive significantly more this weekend, when violence, detentions and failures in the election systems are all likely.
Indeed, political violence has already begun - for instance there was politically motivated murder and assault this week.
On election day, Elección Ciudadana will be maintaining a volunteer center - organized largely by Venezuela Inteligente - for individuals to intake, verify and post reports.
Many others will be volunteering from home.
Their hope is that the varied networks and experiences of each coalition member will make it easier to process, integrate and respond to reports on election day; they will be trying to elicit responses both from major media outlets and the official election authority .
This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011/12.
Bahrain officials announced today that two foreign workers have been killed and a third was seriously injured in five separate bomb blasts in the areas Gudaibiya and Adliya, in the capital Manama.
On Twitter, the news was received with doubt, skepticism and a call for a political solution to end the unrest in the country, following widespread anti-government protests which started on February 14, 2011.
Journalist Adel Marzooq tweets from exile :
@adelmarzooq: Five imaginary explosions and an announcement that Asians have been killed is not haphazard.
They want to dilute the international condemnations for the decision to ban protests and rallies and turn them into a condemnation for terrorism
Ahmed Habib asks:
@ahmdhabib: If the explosions were targeting foreigners, they are aplenty in the villages and no one has attacked them there.
So what is the point of going to Adliya and Umm Al Hassam ?
And Mansour Al Jamri, editor-in-chief of Al Wasat newspaper, writes:
@MANSOOR_ALJAMRi: We hope the Ministry of Interior announces in its Press conference the names and nationalities of those killed and injured.
It is the right of media to know the details.
Thank you
Abu Omar Al Shafiee asks:
@ALSHAF3EE: Is there news about the Asians who were run over by police patrols a few days ago?
There is a bad stench suffocating us these days
Hussain Yousif, a political dissident in exile, adds:
@hussain_info: People have the right to know what happened to the investigation of the Interior Ministry vehicle which ran over Asians between Eker and Maameer as the murderer in known
And Sayed Ahmed Al Alawi casts more doubt:
@SAalalawi: The person who was shown as the one killed in the explosion died because he kicked a locally-made bomb.
How come the explosion effected his neck but not his legs, stomach and chest.
This is one extraordinary bomb Sabeeka Al Shamlan hits back, tongue in cheek:
@Sabeeka_A: Back to square zero.
Oh wait, who said we even moved from there?
And then she asks :
@Sabeeka_A: Has anyone heard the explosions?
With their own ears?
Don't respond to this question if you have not heard the explosions, with your own ears
Noor Bahman takes a step further:
@noorbahman: A bomb does kill a victim on the spot but also destroys quite a proportion of the surrounding area the victim was in.
And Salma asks:
@salmasays: Eh..
Where is free and independent media when you need it..
This exasperation has deeper roots.
Eyad Ebrahim notes :
@eyade: Everyone lies and I don't really believe anyone - not the government, not the opposition, no one.
Murad Alhayki pleas for a political solution.
@muradalhaiki: The more a political solution is delayed, the more complicated matters get and more difficult it is to solve them.
People's blood calls for wisdom
This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011/12.
A nine-story building with mostly garment manufacturers collapsed in Savar, in the outskirts of capital city Dhaka, killing 142 people and injuring close to a thousand, resurrecting concerns of safety conditions in Bangladesh's manufacturing industry.
More than a thousand are believed to still be trapped under the rubble.
Six garment manufacturers were operating from the third to the eight floor of the structure in Savar and at least five thousand people were inside the crowded building when it caved in on the morning of April 24, 2013.
This disaster comes five months after a fire killed more than a 100 people, mostly women, at another overcrowded garment factory Tazreen Fashions.
Since that incident, there has been increasing concern about workers safety and inadequate emergency response systems in the industry.
Garment factory workers have also been agitating against poor-pay.
Bangladesh is the second largest producer of ready-made garments after China.
International retailers Walmart, H&M, Sears, GAP, Tommy Hilfiger and many other renowned brands outsource their cloths from Bangladesh, bearing the tag "Made in Bangladesh", a pride for the country.
Blogger and journalist Arafatul Islam thinks such pride is at stake:
Workers die in factory fires, workers die in factory building collapses.. the procession of the dead becomes long.
I used to buy "Made in Bangladesh" cloths with pride.
Now I see blood on that label, hear the cries of death.

Netizens expressed their outrage on social media about the repeated disasters at garments factories.
Most workers in this sector are women.
Blogger Vashkar Abedin writes in Facebook:
Joydeep Dey Shaplu cannot control his rage in Facebook: Nobody can be alive among all these dead bodies.
We are zombies.. otherwise we could not let so many deaths happen..
There was a crack in the building evident just the day before. The factories were closed immediately .
But the signs of impending collapse were ignored by the building owner as he opened it for business on 24 April and workers were forced to go back to work.
Sumeema Yasmin Sumi cannot accept such a reckless decision from the management:
So many people were forced towards death.
I cannot accept such a lack of responsibility from the management.
Lucky Akter, one of the leading activists of the #Shahbag protests writes in Somehwhereinblog in a post titled "Mourn Not, But Protest":
Slavery has been abolished long ago.
But we see that slavery has returned in a new form.
Otherwise knowing that there is a death-risk, how come these laborers were forced to enter the death-zone?
Were they lured back to work by promising bonuses?
Army personnel and civilian volunteers work together to rescue those trapped.

The majority of Bangladesh's export earnings come from the ready-made textile industry.
Tamanna Sultana writes on Facebook:
I am ashamed!
Those who are the backbones of the economy of the country are dying in hundreds, and nobody cares.
And this is being repeated again and again.
It seems we care about the well beings of rich and powerful only.
The factory owners or those responsible are rarely convicted for their lapses that lead to the big disasters.
Apurbo Shohag expresses rage in Facebook:
In this country death comes easy.
Because the cheapest thing is the human life.
Not only today's disaster in Savar, we have heard many times after the previous factory disasters that those who responsible including the owners will be brought to justice.
But we don't see them get punished.
So such disaster happen again and again.
The bodies pile up in greater numbers.
Many are still buried under concrete rubble.

The Government has declared a day of mourning for such a tragic loss.
There were appeals via Facebook to donate blood, and many rushed to donate blood in Savar and elsewhere.

Volunteers for Bangladesh crowdsourced volunteers via Facebook to help the rescue operations.

Comoros police forces state that they have arrested Congolese and Chadian mercenaries in an attempted coup over the week-end.

The world watched as an Egyptian court sentenced former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and his Interior Minister Habib Al Adly to life imprisonment today for their role in the killing of protesters.
The trial took 49 sessions, 250 hours and spanned 60,000 pages, tweeted Sultan Al Qassemi, quoting judge Ahmed Refaat.
The historic verdict was broadcast live, prompting netizens to post reactions online as the court session progressed.
Mubarak's two sons Alaa and Gamal were acquitted of corruption, as were Al Adly's senior aides, who were blamed for the death of protesters during the Egyptian revolution, which started on January 25, 2011.
Following the verdict, Egyptian blogger Mahmoud Salem, or Sandmonkey, tweets:
@Sandmonkey: #Mubaraktrial ended in a sham verdict: He and his Minister of Interior received an easily turnable life in prison sentence, every1 else free
Adding:
@Sandmonkey: The same people who have killed and tortured egyptians are now free to go back to their jobs at the MOI.

This post is part of our Special Coverage Bangladesh's #Shahbag Protests
As deadly clashes between Islamist activists and authorities continue to escalate religious tensions in Bangladesh, the country's telecommunications authority is making moves to silence bloggers deemed anti-Muslim or anti-state.
Award-winning blogger Asif Mohiuddin and three other bloggers have become the latest target of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, according to online news site online news site Timesworld24.com .
The commission recently contacted Somewhereinblog.net, the largest blogging platform in Bangladesh, requesting that the four blogs be taken down from the site.
In a report on its website, Somewhereinblog.net officially acknowledged that it had removed the four blogs in line with the government request.
The Bangladesh government formed a nine-member committee on March 13, 2013 to track bloggers and Facebook users who made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.
The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, a member of the committee, has requested information on a number of bloggers from different blogging platforms in an effort to ban certain writers considered insulting to Islam or anarchistic.
This development comes after Islamists had claimed that bloggers who support the ongoing Shahbag movement - which demands capital punishment for the country's war criminals, some of which are high-ranking leaders of the country's largest Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami - are atheist and anti-Islamic, and foster anti-social elements.
Mohiuddin, a self proclaimed atheist, has been vocal for the Shahbag movement and wrote against religion and religious politics.
But whether his blogging has anything to do with inciting religious violence and hatred is yet to be proven.
In January 2013, he was brutally attacked by unknown assailants, presumably for his writings.
The police recently arrested four persons who revealed that they attacked Mohiuddin on instruction of a religious extremist.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle Syeda Gulshan Ferdous Jana, founder of Somewhereinblog.net said:
This is the first time in the over seven years of somewhereinblog.net that authorities have issued written instructions to discipline bloggers.
The email named four bloggers, including Asif Mohiuddin's blog profile, and advised us to permanently remove all of these blogs immediately.
Mohiuddin, whose blog won the best social activism blog from the Deutsche Welle Best Of Blogs Awards 2012, has suffered backlash from his writing in the past.
He was arrested in 2011 during an offline protest and police suggested that he should stop writing.
Blogger Asif Mohiuddin.

On March 20, 2013, Mohiuddin and seven other bloggers were sued by an individual in the northern Bangladeshi district of Natore on charges of libeling Islam, God, and the Prophet Muhammad.
Another lawsuit against these bloggers in Chittagong was dismissed on March 6, 2013 for lack of evidence.
Mohiuddin commented in a Facebook note about his recent ban:
Each day, many posts are published on religion.
But when I wrote only that "I do not believe in traditional religions", I was attacked by many.
In the same post, he called the commission's efforts to shut down blogs a dangerous precedent:
If the writings of any blogger defies any of the rules of the blog or is deemed illegal then the blog owners can decide on that.
Which posts should be published or not should be at the discretion of the blog platform, not the regulatory authorities.
Just imagine, if the authorities can manage to shut down a voice by forcing the platforms to do so they can start believing that they can control the bloggers.
So they will find another reason to ban another blogger.
The government will change and imagine if any radical Islamist government comes to power what will happen?
In an interview with Deutsche Welle radio Mohiuddin has said that he will not give up blogging.
"Stop authoritarian aggression against bloggers.
Blogging is our right."

Bangladesh is a non-religious parliamentary democracy, so there is no sharia law or blasphemy law.
If anybody claims to be an atheist, he or she has the same rights as other citizens.
However, Under Section 295A of Bangladesh's Penal Code (1860), any person who has a "deliberate" or "malicious" intention of "hurting religious sentiments" is liable to imprisonment.
The commission has stated that according to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Act, it can ask required information from any individual or institution who uses the Internet.
However, blogging platform Amarblog published a statement on March 22, 2013 saying that it won't jeopardize bloggers' privacy at the request of the government.
It questioned the commission's legal authority to ask for blogger information as well as questioned if it has jurisdiction over Amarblog which is registered in United Kingdom and hosted on an overseas server.
Bloggers have also doubted the legal basis for such demands.
Blogger Mohammad Munim criticized the commission on Muktangon, a community blog:
I thinks there are two reasons behind this.
The first one is theoretical, both the Islamist hardliner and practicing Muslims are skeptic about atheists.
Religion is very powerful, sometimes more than the state such as when the state has to accept the help of religion.
If any of those establishments are in trouble, they take refuge in religion.
Religion accomplishes their job by deploying instruments like blind faith, taking things for granted, and keeping people in fear.
When patriarchal oppression is protested by women, religion keeps them in check, workers cannot revolt against autocratic employers as religion reminds that for those who have less in this world, there is an afterlife waiting for them.
To remain in power the simplest of weapons is religion.
The second reason is the reaction to the Shahbag mass-uprising.
Being labeled as an atheist is a distraction even among fellow protesters, so the atheists are becoming an easy target for the Jamaat-Shibir-Hijbut Tahrir.
Update: According to the latest reports, the nine-member committee participated in a discussion forum with the clerics community of the country.
A list of 84 bloggers and Facebook users have been submitted and the committee asked from the community concrete evidence against their allegations.
The committee has publicized an email account where complaints on blasphemous contents will be received.

Journalist Jenan Moussa is back in Aleppo, Syria, tweeting her experiences as the war between pro- and anti-government forces intensifies.
Moussa's tweets are raw and personal, giving readers a snippet of what life is like for those caught in the crossfire.
Moussa, who is a roving reporter for Arabic Al Aan TV, Dubai, UAE, observes:
@jenanmoussa: Its great to be back in #Aleppo & meet all my friends.
City seems much better than last time I was here.
People adapted to war.
Dinner, in Aleppo, is accompanied by the sounds of mortars falling in the distance:
@jenanmoussa: It's dinner time here in #Aleppo.
We are having Mexicana chicken as sound of mortars echoes at a distance.
After a night in the city, Moussa wonders:
@jenanmoussa: Morning from #Aleppo.
I couldn't sleep till 6 am.
Everytime I closed my eyes I imagined bombs falling.
God, how do ppl stay sane?
In Aleppo, she visits the site where a Scud missile fell some 45 days earlier.
@jenanmoussa: Earlier today I went to site where SCUD missile fell 45 days ago in #Aleppo.
6 bodies are still missing under rubble

Photograph shared by @jenanmoussa on Twitter
@jenanmoussa: In #Aleppo I saw a father sitting on rubble, tears in his eyes.
He's still looking for bodies of his 2 beautiful daughters & wife
@jenanmoussa: While I was w/ him, father found slippers of a child & handful of hair ( woman's hair) under rubble.
Maybe it's my wife' he told me
Despite the stressful situation, Moussa maintains her humour:
@jenanmoussa: Activists here in #Aleppo laugh at me.
I am sometimes only one wearing my flak jacket in house.
They are used to the sounds of war.
And then goes to sleep without dinner:
@jenanmoussa: We didn't have dinner tonight.
Also no shower.
Not a necessity in a city like #Aleppo.
Good night you all.
Pernille shares photos of a building that collapsed in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania on Friday, 29 March 20013: "Nearby is a football field used by children.
Over 60 persona, including children, are reported missing according to ITV.
No confirmations at this early stage."
It's exactly two years since over 80 people died in bomb blasts at Kyaddondo Rugby Club and Ethiopian Village bar, Uganda.
All these people had gone to watch the World Cup final taking place in South Africa.
Being that it was the first time Africa was hosting this tournament, people were waiting eagerly for the final match which was between the Netherlands and Spain.
It was approaching 12am when the bombs took off, leaving over 70 people dead on the spot and others injured.

Since the early 2000s, entrepreneurship in Africa has reported strong organic growth .
However this development has not spread in all market sectors and too often seems to be limited to service industries and trade.
Africa has 65 million Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) , nevertheless it is still struggling to develop a class of local entrepreneurs to manage strategic industries, specifically the export of agricultural raw materials, mining, transport and industry public works where the market too often turns to foreign managers.
Yet investors' enthusiasm for Africa, that many see as the latest Gold Rush for those seeking an alternative to Asian markets, has an impact on local government policies which are concerned with developing their private sectors.
The final report of the World Bank indicates that the reforms undertaken by most African governments have improved the business environment in the administrative, fiscal and regulatory domains.

Numerous academics and researchers have examined the influence of cultural practices in order to understand the entrepreneurial adventure in Africa.
Their researches led them to consider the weight of cultural values and principles strongly anchored into the collective psyche of African businessmen to evaluate the factors for success for African entrepreneurs.
The irrationality of economic choices of African business executives facing the social pressure of ethnicity,or their extended family has been extensively studied. Success stories in Africa- sucessful and entrepreneurial leaders in Africa
Traditional African values facing the liberal economy
Kabeya Tshikuku, professor at the Institute of Economic and Social Research (IRES) at the University of Kinshasa, has argued that business logic is forcing African policymakers to make a difficult choice between the core values of their civilization (family solidarity, peers well being and other support platforms) and business administration, linked to a search for profit devoid of human consideration.
The roots of capitalism, utility and individualism, encountered more resistance in the African psyche.
Africa and Africans are not liable guilty of any offence in the form of irrationality.
The « cultural issue” lies elsewhere, as far development is concerned.
It lies entirely in the distinction made by each culture between « cardinal values of civilization ” and the “ instrumental values”.
From the strict cultural point of view, two systems are competing for the allegiance of people and the allocation of resources.
To put it clearly, Africa is navigating between two competing systems of culture, the retrograde system of management of people and the (revolutionary?) administration of things.
The reasons for existence and action have not yet completely lost their roots in the pre-capitalist system; they have not yet taken root in the capitalist system.
The old framework of lifelong solidarity has not totally disintegrated; the new framework of capitalist individualism has not finished moving in.
Combining solidarity and growth
The growth that fueled the continent's GDP over the past decade indicates that this rational, individualistic capitalism is installed progressively albeit unevenly across the continent.
It penetrates the public consciousness at the discretion of the efficiency or the aggressiveness of reforms undertaken by the government to boost the private sector.
Corporate governance has become a central theme for the business community especially after the shocking wave of the Enron scandal in United States.
Will African entrepreneurs know how to integrate the principles of corporate governance with the ubuntu philosophy in which the group comes before the individual?
The former Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade of Mali, Amadou Abdoulaye Diallo, pointed out that Africa is an excellent example of the paradox.
He explains to Célia d'ALMEIDA in the Journal of Mali:
A decade ago, the African socio-economic environment was considered unfavourable to the creation and development of business ventures.
In some countries, the legal framework for business leaves room for few incentives due to weaknesses such as lack of credit access, scarcity of information on business opportunities, absence of support for young entrepreneurs (no business incubators) and insufficient skilled workforce for company management.
To all this is added a shortage of political strategy.
However, more recently, African countries like ours, undertake major reforms to facilitate business creation and provide a favourable climate for business development.
In Cameroon, Richard Ewelle's post in Kamer Blog concludes on culture and entrepreneurship in Africa:
The development of entrepreneurship in Africa will require the creation of the concept of African entrepreneurship and not necessarily an exact copy of what is abroad.
We need to combine best practices in creating Western corporate context along African concepts.
The concept of African entrepreneurship will be based on the value of African culture but also on developing solidarity that promotes the socio-economic environment.
In August, Global Voices reported on several activists from Russia’s protest movement running for office in local elections.
They hoped it would be easier to win these small-scale contests, which took place last weekend.
On October 14, amid low turnout and perennial allegations of electoral fraud, Russians participated in thousands of elections across the country, voting for local mayors, city councilors, and regional legislatures.
Five governorships were also in play, for the first time since Vladimir Putin canceled such elections seven years ago.
Dirty tricks and mudslinging
When the dust had settled, the result was that members of the opposition movement did not do well in the few places where they fielded candidates.
The United Russia party, and other pro-Putin candidates, took the lion’s share of the votes in most races.
The only nominally-opposition parties to enjoy even limited success were the usual suspects: the Communists, LDPR, and Just Russia.
It remains unclear how much of United Russia’s success is due to fraud and other illegal actions.
Nevertheless, there are widespread reports of dirty tactics.
Evgeniya Chirikova, Leader of the Khimki Forest Defenders, in Khimki, Russia (19 April 2011), By Daniel Beilinson, CC 2.0.
For example, journalist Dmitry Aleshkovsky blogged about the elections in a small district in the republic of Tatarstan in very apocalyptic terms :
I have seen people dying of cholera in the shade of ruined houses in Port-au-Prince demolished by an earthquake, I have seen thousands of burned houses in Georgian villages in South Ossetia .
These elections make me feel about the same amount of horror as what I've described above.
Aleshkovsky went on to describe numerous violations, ranging from extra ballots in voting boxes to the forcible removal of independent observers.
The extent to which pro-government fraud was present, even in the smallest elections and for the most irrelevant of positions, is striking.
Sergey Ezhov, a member of Limonov’s Other Russia movement, ran for city council in the tiny town of Sarai.
He described that experience in his blog:
The lawlessness began a few days before the vote.
When the cardsharps understood that I’m making it to deputy.
Quiet and peaceful Sarai was inundated with deceitful and provocative leaflets, voters were rounded up where they work and study, and told to not for Ezhov for any reason.
At the same time, the police began to interfere with our campaigning.
Ezhov lost.
He had thought that the irrelevancy of the post he sought would make him immune from government pressure.
Apparently, he was wrong in that assumption.
As it turns out, some of these dirty tactics were used against United Russia members by other United Russia members.
Such was the case in Angara, reports Sergey Schmidt, a local political science professor.
A United Russia candidate for mayor seemingly got the short shrift -– his campaign was plagued by scandals, the governor openly supported his opponent, and so on.
He ended up winning, however, largely because voters wanted to “support and help the person who is being hounded,” Schmidt argues.
It seems that the mudslinging had gone overboard.
Eggs all in a single basket, where they are safest
Screenshot from the opposition's Elections Commission website for the Coordinating Council vote.
19 October 2012.
Most notably, the opposition's headliner also lost.
Evgenya Chirikova’s bid for mayor in the Moscow suburb of Khimki was the only race where the movement came together in a meaningful way, marshaling significant donations and campaign volunteers.
Yet, Chirikova still lost, with just 20% of the vote.
Although there were some irregularities, exit polls confirmed the official vote tally.
Chirikova lost, even though she is one of the better known leaders of the opposition, particularly in Khimki, where she's an active member of the local community.
In short, the opposition fared poorly.
This is not in dispute.
But there is also no arguing that the protest movement honestly dedicated itself to winning these contests.
Chirikova was in fact the only major candidate to represent the new movement.
Local elections could have been a great opportunity to try campaigning on a local level and perhaps decentralize the protest movement, devolving it to regional populations.
Yet this opportunity seems to have been thrown away.
For the past month, the nation's October 14 elections were scarcely on the blogosphere's radar (Chirikova being the exception that proves the rule).
Perhaps, if the massive get-out-the-vote machine tasked with mobilizing netizen voters had shifted focus to actual voters, it would have succeeded in increasing the meager October 14 turnout (especially considering how difficult it is become a verified voter on cvk2012.org ).
As it stands, it’s almost as if the Coordinating Council induced election fatigue.
Hopefully it was worth it.
In much of Kurdistan, there has been solidarity protests but despite the attention the hunger strikes have received within Kurdish regions, there are few mainstream media outlets reporting on the hunger strike.
The lack of media coverage has angered many Kurds, who are being vocal on social networking sites.
Hulya, from Liverpool, says:
@hulyaulas: The biggest political hunger strike in history by Kurdish political prisoners is being ignored in world's media.
Dirman adds:
@dirman95: It is so hard to eat knowing that the hunger strike has been going on for over 51 days and the world is doing nothing about it… disgusting.
Al Jazeera’s The Stream has been the only internationally acknowledged mainstream outlet that has highlighted the gravity of the hunger strike.
They have used their social media outlets to raise awareness.
For example they recently tweeted:
@ajstream: Why has the government and Media in Turkey ignored the hunger strikes of 715 Kurdish political prisoners?
An online petition has been launched, with 3,451 supporters so far, that asks the Turkish government to engage in constructive dialogue with the prisoners.
Judith Butler from Berkeley comments:
The Turkish government must enter into serious dialogue with these prisoners who now risk their lives to expose the injustice under which they live.
KurdishBlogger.com posted the following picture on Facebook.
Kurds in Slemani, South Kurdistan show solidarity with their Kurdish sisters and brothers (at least 682 inmates) who are on hunger strike in 67 prisons across Turkey.
And Tara Fatehi, a Kurdish activist in Australia, expressed her anger at the international community:
Thousands of Kurdish political prisoners have been on hunger strike in Turkey since Sept 12 and the International community remains silent.
This is Kurdish hunger for freedom, it is not a new concept.
The Kurds have been fighting for rights, peace and freedom for decades.
Hannelore Kuchlersaid said it best "Kurdistan is a country taken hostage." and whilst the international media want you to think this is solely about Abdullah Ocalan and the PKK, it is not.
It's about acquiring basic human rights in their own homeland.

Members of Hifazat-e Islam, a radical Islamist party in Bangladesh, attacked female journalists on assignment as the group marched in the country's capital to demand strict Islamic law, including a ban on free mixing of the sexes and punishment of "atheists and blasphemous bloggers".
Hefazot Islam introduced their 13-point demand during the march on April 6, 2013 in Dhaka, which would enforce capital punishment for blasphemy, make Islamic education compulsory, and see the the end of "all alien cultural practices like immodesty, lewdness, misconduct, culture of free mixing of the sexes, candle lighting in the name of personal freedom and free speech."
On 6th of April Hifazat-e Islam arranged a rally to demand action against ‘atheists and blasphemous bloggers’ of the Shahbagh’s Ganajagaran Mancha.

On the day of the long march, Hifazat-e Islam not only barred women from entering the event, but also physically and verbally harassed several female journalists on duty there.
Numbers of Hifazat activists chased and physically assaulted Ekushey Television Reporter Nadia Sharmin at Bijoynagar on the path of the rally, and interrupted Financial Express Reporter Arafat Ara at Paltan, close to the event venue, when she was going to her office.
Memberse hurled brickbats and water bottles at Sharmin and she was thrown to ground and beaten.
She was sent to the hospital for treatment and was released after three days.
Cases were filed against 60 people. This video uploaded to YouTube by ProfessorZiauddin shows Sharmin being attacked by a Hifazat mob:
An old woman collecting water bottles at the rally area was driven away on the pretext that "it is not a place for females".
However, amid countrywide protest of the attacks on the journalists, which called for a boycott of news and broadcast of the news of the Islamists, representatives from Hifazat stated later that the group regretted the attack, saying "miscreants had carried out the attacks on scribes". Hefazot Islam activists attack journalist Nadia Sharmin as she covers their long march.

Residents of China’s southwestern Kunming city took to the streets on May 4, 2013 to protest against the potential production of a toxic chemical at a nearby factory.
According to state media, the China National Petroleum Corporation plans to build a chemical plant in the nearby town of Anning to produce 500,000 tonnes of paraxylene (PX) used to make fabric.
Close to 3,000 people gathered in the city center to protest against the dangers of a possible PX spill.
China's state media kept the news of the protest quiet, and online censors have aggressively deleted information and photos about the demonstration on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo since May 4, 2013.
Many Web users switched their Weibo profile photos to an image of “Kunming PX” crossed-out to show support.
Kunming is well-known for its flowers and plants thanks to its perpetual spring-like weather.
It is one of the few Chinese cities that regularly enjoy clear blue skies.
Similar protests had erupted in different cities in recent years.
In 2007, thousands of people in China's eastern Xiamen city protested the construction of a PX plant.
In the past two years, two large NIMBY protests erupted in Dalian and Ningbo.
Protesters wore symbolic masks and brandished posters warning against the dangers of a paraxylene (PX) spill.
(From Sina Weibo)
Media control, cell phone signals cut off, the police who are supposed to defend the safety of the people didn't protect the people, "XX petrochemical refinery, get out of Kunming!"
We do not want milk river, we do not want PM2.5 , we do not want PX.
Please repost this message.
Protect our mother Kunming.
Another Weibo user from Kunming criticized the media censorship:
Such a big country, yet only "Beijing Evening News" truthfully reported what happened in Kunming yesterday.
It was not an original report, but quoted from NetEase.
It is said that China news agency did the interview yesterday, but was forbidden to publish in the end.
Xinhua News Agency or CCTV hide as far away as they can….China has no media to speak for its people.
Please repost the message if you agree.
A musician from Kunming “Yinyue Xiaosun” echoed the sentiment:
Banner reads: "Beautiful Kunming!
We need to survive!
We want to be healthy!
PX—out of Kunming !"
(From Sina Weibo)
But you live in Kunming.
We all love our own hometown and want our children to breathe the fresh air, don’t you?? Don’t you? Don’t you?
Weibo user “Kong Batian” recalled the World Horticultural Exposition in Kunming in 1999:
This is the great irony for the Kunming people!
Many Weibo users quoted a poem written by famous journalist Bai Yansong:
Sign reads "Uncle and aunt, we need clean air!"
(From Sina Weibo)
Soon the city will slowly become out of sight and forgotten by history.
The beautiful legend will always be a legend.
No one will be held responsible because the ones that should be have already left the city, and their children have already immigrated, leaving a tattered and polluted city with innocent people, a cancer area ..... this city is called Kunming.

Last week, a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama on the value of engaged citizenship made waves in Chinese social media.
Influential Sina Weibo user @假装在纽约, or “pretending to be in New York,” a widely followed provocateur who frequently tweets about the U.S. and whose account has more than 470,000 followers recommended the speech to Chinese youths:
(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)
The core of Obama’s speech yesterday at the Ohio State University Commencement is ‘a sense of citizenship, I roughly translated his speech, because I feel that Chinese youth may perhaps be even more in need of this kind of education, which they do not receive in Chinese classrooms.
In his commencement speech on May 5, President Obama said, ”We are not a collection of strangers…we are bound to one another by a set of ideals and laws and commitments.” ”Pretending to be in New York’s” post, together with his translation of the speech, attracted over 30,000 retweets and nearly 6,000 comments in about two days.
Though this is not the first time that Chinese netizens have compared the circumstances of China and the U.S., the concept of “citizenship” has stirred yet another round of discussion about the rights and responsibilities of the Chinese people, as well as criticism of the government.
Yin Hong (@尹鸿), executive dean of the Tsinghua School of Journalism and Communication, commented :
Though this is not the best speech, ‘citizenship awareness’ has been described very clearly: everyone has natural rights, so everyone also has natural responsibilities.
This is citizenship.
Without human rights, there should be no responsibilities.
Rights and responsibilities go hand in hand.
Another Weibo user, "Once very fat" (@曾经的胖胖胖胖), wrote:
Why do the Chinese lack a sense of citizenship?
Because they don’t feel that this government has anything to do with them, and truthfully, the government is not an elected body.
"Dragon Ash" (@龙团一灰) commented ,
a socialist country, we cannot think about such things; the more you think about them, the worse you will feel.
As for rights, whatever the civil servants say goes.
The sentiments apparent in the comments on Pres Obama’s speech went beyond envy, jealous and pity.
They also included discussions about the struggles, difficulties, and bitterness that Chinese youth face today.
Weibo user "Big Guy Moving Like Dragon and Tiger" (@大背头龙行虎步 wrote :
The youth all start out hoping for a sense of citizenship, but after hitting the wall over and over again in society, they turn towards nepotism.
This is ‘soy-sauce vat’ China, where everything ends up black regardless of how it started out.
One generation after another, this is our traditional culture: dictatorship, authoritarianism, and intolerance of opposition. The burdens of tradition are way too heavy; democracy might be another century away.
User "Hula Baopei" (@呼啦啦啦宝宝_佩) mused:
While Chinese college graduates succumb to reality and lose their dreams in the face of high prices and unaffordable housing right after college, American youth can make the future of their country their personal mission; they’ve been endowed with a strong sense of citizenship, they hold fast to their dreams, and they take the responsibility for the nation’s development.
I am wondering, where is China’s future?
Where is the future of the next generation?
Such concerns might just be timely, with graduation right around the corner for many in China.
Perhaps for most recent college graduates, the most pressing issue facing them is not how to change the nation, but how to survive in a gloomy economy.
In fact, 2013 is believed to be the most difficult job hunting season modern China has ever faced.
While almost seven million college graduates are entering the job market, only nine million new jobs have been created, and college graduates must compete with returning students from abroad, as well as high school graduates and trade school graduates.
The ratio of college graduates to jobs is believed to be the lowest in Chinese history .
A sense of citizenship may mean more than thinking independently and forming opinions that differ from the propaganda of the Chinese government.
More importantly, it represents an ability to be balanced and independent when facing authority, an ability that flows from the feeling of being an influential part of the country, however small the individual may be.
As Ren Zhiqiang (@任志强), a real estate tycoon with more than 14 million followers on Weibo, opined ,
The president’s speeches have never been edicts that all are required to study, but simply common sense.

Portuguese artist Isabel Fiadeiro (@Isabelfiadeiro) lives in Nouakchott, Mauritania, where she paints and runs an art gallery.
Fiadeiro also sketches from observation, filling her blog Sketching in Mauritania with images of daily life in the West African nation.
Global Voices spoke to Fiadeiro about her art and how sketching has helped her get to know Mauritania.
Global Voices (GV): Where are you from originally?
How long have you lived in Mauritania and what took you there in the first place?
Isabel Fiadeiro (IF): My father is Portuguese and my mother Spanish.
I grew up in Portugal and I feel Portuguese.
I also lived in England for almost 15 years (on and off).
Actually I left London in March 2003 to go back and settle in Portugal; I had finished a BA in Fine Arts at the Wimbledon School of Arts in 2000, and I stopped painting for the next three years, so I decided it was time to go.
In November 2003, a Portuguese friend and I decided to travel to Guinea-Bissau in a Renault 4L.
The car broke down in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin on the Mauritanian coast.
My friend stayed in Nouakchott and I went off with a group of French people to discover the Adrar Region.
We went on off-road tracks and through the desert stopping occasionally in small villages to buy bread or repair the tyres.
I had a sketch book with me and for the first time I started drawing from observation.
It was this curiosity of knowing more about the people that lived in the middle of these vast empty spaces that made me come back in January 2004, and in September 2004 I moved to Nouakchott and I'm still here.
Diallo and Mamadou, tailors in Nouakchott.

GV: How does sketching help you understand a place?
IF: Drawing and the observation that comes with it makes you see the world in a different way.
You slow down, you look and you discover things.
For me this act of drawing is also a sort of memory and questioning.
People around you come to see what you're doing so it works in two ways.
You're recording what attracted your attention, but by your action communication becomes possible, even if you don't speak the language.
Police at demonstration, Nouakchott.
Sketch by Isabel Fiadeiro.
For years I would go to a remote village for a month and stay with a local family, drawing their daily life.
I did that in two fishing villages in the Banc d'Arguin but also in Oualata, Goungel and Ouadane.
My last long stay was in Tindouf in the Western Sahara refugee camps where I went to sketch the women and their work in the camps.
All those people became friends and we still exchange mails and phone calls and meet if they happen to come to Nouakchott.
Also in each area I discovered a new vocabulary to do with the sea or the land and the cattle or the revolution.
Griots at the Fondation Malouma.
Sketch by Isabel Fiadeiro.
GV: You are also a member of the online community Urban Sketchers.
Can you tell us about them?
IF: Urban Sketchers is a non-profitmaking, international organisation, dedicated to fostering the art of on-location drawing and painting.
I am one of 100 correspondents invited from around the globe.
Our aim is to inspire others to sketch daily, this way improving their skills and observation capacities.
I discovered them in 2008, and it was a great discovery because until then I was isolated, and finding this community suddenly made me want to sketch more and better.
The founder of Urban Sketchers, Gabi Campanario, uses sketches as a reportage tool; his work is published in the Seattle Times.
This way of using sketches made a strong impression on me.

I have participated in a number of Urban Sketchers symposiums. The next one is in Barcelona.
We now have another correspondent from Mauritania, Oumar Ball, who started sketching from observation a few years ago and publishes his work on Flickr.
Later this year I would like to hold some talks and workshops to encourage more people in Mauritania to sketch from observation.
Citymag, a free magazine distributed monthly in Nouakchott has started to publish my drawings.
Maybe that will inspire more people to pick up a pen or pencil and start sketching.
In the wake of the Fiscal Reform submitted to the National Congress, which was met with strong disapproval by civil society, the business sector and trade unions, various movements in opposition to the bill have been organized .
Demonstrations have been taking place since the 4th of October, when the draft bill was announced.
However, since Tuesday the 6th of November, citizens have increased the intensity of their protests, with daily numbers up.
On Thursday, the 8th of November, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, the sole public university in the country, was the scene of one of these anti-government protests.
But as is customary—and in spite of different regulations which prohibit it—students were confronted by a unit of armed police, culminating in the death of 21-year-old William Florián Ramírez , a third-year medical student, hit by a bullet to the chest.

This image has been widely disseminated over the Internet.
The indignation took little time to be felt on social networks and on pirate radio.
Civic leader Elizabeth Mateo, popularly known as the leader of the fight to get 4% of GDP spent on education, published the following on Twitter:
@ElizabethMateo: I condemn the killing of the UASD student.
I demand justice.
Likewise, investigator, consultant and columnist Olaya Dotel, stated:

@OlayaDotel: These corrupt individuals in control of the State are not worth a drop of the blood of our young people...not one more!!!
The controversy has spread so far that René, vocalist in the popular Puerto Rican group Calle 13, commented on the incident:
@Calle13Oficial: The world is looking at the Dominican Republic, hoping that justice will be done for the death of the young medical student Willy Warden!
All of these incidents have taken place as it was revealed that, during the precarious economic conditions and high social tension the country is currently facing,

the Minister of Education, Josefina Pimentel, increased her own salary by 62% , from RD$185,000.00 to RD$300,000.00 a month, equivalent to USD $7,500.00.
The fusion of these and other trigger issues, far from discouraging protestors, has renewed their revolutionary spirit.
A group of around 100 people, including public figures and media, congregated in front of the buildings of the Global Foundation for Democracy and Development (FUNGLODE), an institution set up by former president Leonel Fernández Reyna, who is deemed responsible for having bankrupted the nation during his eight years in power (see video here) .
Protestors placed candles in the street and sang their condemnation in unison, at the top of their lungs.
Twitter was the medium which gave the most coverage to the event, with Twitterers grouping themselves together under the hashtag #FrenteaFunglode.
Reporter Maribel Hernández shared this from her Twitter account:
@MaribelNexos: The National Police, a criminal gang, shouts the #FrenteaFunglode crowd.
@MaribelNexos: The crowd is screaming Global Foundation, national shame. #FrenteaFunglode #FrenteaFunglode
But things don't stop there.
Both civil organizations and individuals have flooded the Internet with a grand display of creativity, via numberless ads and images against the pro-government party and the current administration, such as those displayed below.
In the same vein, various mobilizations at all levels were planned for Friday, the 9th of November, as well as for the rest of the week.
I leave you with some of the calls to protest and examples of graphical artwork focused on the events.

A resounding theme in Malaysia’s 13th General Election on May 5, 2013 has been the prospect of change, or 'ubah' (change in Malay).
A popular slogan being bandied about is ‘ini kalilah, ubah’ which translates as ‘this time around, change comes’.
Having said that, it is unclear how the election will play out, and Channel News Asia has reported that the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition might still win, but with a smaller margin.
BN has ruled Malaysia for the past half-century.
Shufei made a case for a change in government:
I'm not one for politics.
I detest it actually, it makes me more emotional than almost anything else.
I'm so easily roused by anger when I read about prejudices, dirty tricks, unjustified behaviour, corruption.
Everything that is humanely destructive but equally bracketed into the flawed mortality of individuals I'm entrusting my country with.
But don't you think we should have a choice?
A two-party system so we have the ability to choose if the government is corrupt?
Isn't that what democracy is all about?
Not being shushed or silenced because 'they have done so much things for us'.
Yes, they have done things for us, but they're our government.
It's, I'm sorry to be blunt, their job.
Glam also urged their readers to vote for a change in government, using several videos.
Anil Netto also posted a video of voters in Penang calling for change in the country.
The people have made up their minds.
This wasn’t about the people calling for tunnels, new highways and more high-rise luxury condos; it was the about the people calling for an end to corruption in the country and for political change at the federal level.
Thomas described Prime Minister Najib Razak as the 'Trojan Horse' of Malaysian politics:
Throughout the country, on the numerous BN’s billboards, printed materials and TV commercials and news, it is Najib’s sweet and gentle smiling face that you see.
Never before in the history of general elections in our country has so much been hinged on the persona of a man instead of on the ideals or vision of the party for the country.
But Najib Razak is a trojan horse, constructed by professional public relations firm like APCO with the help of a very compliant broadcast and printing mass media industry.
He has had an extreme makeover which transformed him from an ultra Malay rights politician to one that espouse the inclusive and tolerant values of 1Malaysia.
Malaysia has been swamped with campaign materials such as banners, flags, posters and billboards.

This is the first time that postal voting is allowed in the Malaysian elections.
Chelliah, a Malaysian living in the UK, wrote about their excitement at the possibility of a change in government:
As I write this post the sun is rising in Malaysia on a new day and I will be going to bed soon because it is the end of the day in the UK.
There is something ironic about that.
I left Malaysia 32 years ago and although I now live thousands of miles away I am excited at the prospect of 'Ubah' ('change' in the Malay language)becoming a reality on 0505.
The election or GE13 as it has become known, I suspect, will be a political milestone for the manifestation of Malaysian unity all over the world.
I don't think I am alone in hoping for Ubah while living in a foreign land.
You may wonder why this is important for someone who does not experience daily life under a regime that many Malaysians experience as being corrupt and authoritarian.
I may not live there now but I did live the daily life of state-led grind for many years.
In Melbourne, JOM Magazine, a magazine that caters to the Malaysian community, made a video about the postal voting day, which was held a week before May 5.
There is also a video of Malaysian voters in London:
With social media so widely used, it is not a surprise that this election has been dubbed the social media election.
Elias Munshya, a Zambian lawyer and paster, explains why parastatals have failed in Zambia since independence:
Parastatals have never made a profit since 1964.
Parastatals have been run not on a business model but on a political model.
Parastatals have not had professionals running the boards but they have been staffed with relatives, nephews, nieces and great-grandsons of the politicians

Lebanese blogger Habib Battah narrates how he was held against his consent, forced to delete photographs of ruins from his phone camera and repeatedly assaulted in this post on the Beirut Report.
When he reported the case to his local police station, the officers in charge said it was his word against theirs.
He adds:
They were right.
If the men on site were willing to beat me up to please their boss, they would certainly lie for him.
And I was sealed in, no one from the street could witness how they had repeatedly assaulted me.
I left the police station feeling that Lebanese citizens have no protection under the law.

Global Voices reviews the May 1, 2013 Labor Day protests in Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore.
The rallies, which were organized to echo the various demands of workers and advocacy groups, were relatively peaceful across the region.
In Cambodia, more than 6,000 garment workers were joined by students, NGOs, and urban poor residents in Phnom Penh City who marched from the Freedom Park to the National Assembly calling for living wages and improved working conditions.

In the Philippines, labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno is disappointed with the labor policies of the government:
We mark the 127th International Workers’ Day and its 110th celebration in the Philippines with a nationwide protest condemning the rabidly anti-worker and pro-capitalist regime of Pres. Noynoy Aquino.
Aquino has again rejected workers’ calls for a significant wage hike, the junking of contractual employment and a stop to trade-union repression.
He has bragged about non-wage benefits and his government’s efforts at creating jobs.

We realised that we are also creating another piece of history in Singapore here as so far no one has managed to organise a labour day event from the ground up – ever and we are proud to be able to do so for the first time!
We may even contemplate doing an annual labour day protest from now on – like what many other countries have done for decades.

The same day that the death toll of a nine-story factory collapse in Savar in the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka rose to 1,055, now the deadliest building collapse since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a female worker named Reshma Begum was found alive after being trapped in the rubble for 17 days.
Begum worked on the building's second floor as a sewing operator.
As the building collapsed, the 24-year-old was trapped in a mosque inside the basement and survived 416 hours there by breathing through a pipe and scavenging for biscuits in the rucksacks of dead colleagues.
In the first few days after the structure caved in on April 24,2013, 2,428 people were rescued from the collapsed building.
Hope that others survivors will be found among the rubble is fading fast.

Begum told a news agency: I survived mainly by drinking water.
I was trapped immediately after the building collapse.
I quickly went to the prayer room for refuge.
The rescuers dropped water inside in different times.
I managed to collect two bottles and survived on them all these days.
Begum's miraculous survival has caused a stir among many.
Hearing the good news, blogger Ashraf Shishir (@ashrafshishir) wrote:

Baroness Sayeeda Hussain Warsi (@SayeedaWarsi), senior minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs of UK, responded after hearing the news of Reshma's rescue:
@SayeedaWarsi: Extraordinary & uplifting scenes of a young women rescued 17 days after #Savar building collapse.
A ray of hope in the midst of tragedy.
Asif Touhid, a marketing professional, wrote on Facebook: Reshma ...
Journalist Kamrul Hasan (@_Kamrul_Hasan_) thanked all the rescuers who worked hard to pull out Begum alive: @Kamrul_Hasan: Even this is possible!
Congratulations Reshma, please stay alive and well.
Many thanks to the Bangladesh army rescue team for their efforts.
The role of the media was questioned as they converged on the rescued Begum and tried to interview her. Journalist Tanvir Ahmed urged his colleagues on Facebook:
Relatives of missing or dead garment workers remain optimistic even 17 days after the incident.
The readymade garments industry is the largest export earners of Bangladesh, so in the eyes of many the building collapse is a negative portrayal of Bangladesh's image.
Bangladesh survived under rubble for 17 days.
Sister Reshma - you have come back from the dead hole. You have shown that Bangladesh even survives under rubble.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of the Dhaka Tribune, concluded in an interview with Australian website News.com.au: Reshma represents the best of Bangladesh, the nation's resilience in the face of unbelievable hardship, its courage, its strength, its determination to never give up whatever the odds.
Omar Qatifaan, a 14-year-old media activist, was killed 21 May, 2013 while covering clashes between the Syrian Army and the rebel Free Army in the southern Daraa al-Ballad area of Syria near the border with Jordan.
Youth media project Syrian Documents reported on his death, and Syrian news blog YALLA SOURIYA called him the "Spirit of Syria".
The conflict in Syria, as well as other Arab Spring uprisings, has seen a rise in citizen journalists reporting from the ground on the ongoing war between the country's pro- and anti-government forces.
Many have been detained, tortured, and even killed while trying to bring the story of the revolution to the world.
Children have also paid a terrible price during the conflict, with thousands killed during the violence so far.

This post is part of our Special Coverage Pakistan Votes 2013. Popular cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, whose hopeful campaign promise of a "New Pakistan" has drawn large crowds of young people and urban voters to his rallies ahead of the country's general elections, fractured three vertebrae and a rib after falling off a 15-feet high forklift just before a scheduled speech.
Khan, who was at a rally in the city of Lahore, was immediately rushed to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital.
Within a few hours of being hospitalized, he regained consciousness and managed to make a powerful political speech to the journalists at his bedside.
With the country's hotly contested elections on May 11, 2013 only days away, Khan's dramatic fall comes during the final campaign push.
He is leading Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a newcomer that could be a strong contender for the people's representation in the upcoming elections.
But phenomenally, the incident shows signs of bridging the bitter political divides across the country, with political rivals, critics, and opponents putting aside their differences to wish Khan good health.

The news instantly replaced all other headlines on TV channels and social media were soon abuzz with it.
People from all sorts of political affiliations, from his staunch rivals, Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif, to international celebrities such as Brian Lara, spoke up to wish Imran Khan a speedy recovery.
West Indies cricketer Brian Lara (@BrianLara) tweeted from his account on May 8, 2013:
@BrianLara: Imran Khan injured @ rally fell off stage... Out of danger Thank God!!
Get well soon great man.
Continue striving in what u believe in.
Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) leader Shahbaz Sharif posted on his Facebook page:
Just visited Imran Khan in the hospital and conveyed best wishes of Mian Nawaz Sharif... He is Alhumdulillah fine and recovering mashaaAllah... Prayers for him and his family!!!
Maryam Nawaz Sharif (@MaryamNSharif), the daughter of PML-N's chief Nawaz Sharif, also resounded similar sentiments:
@MaryamNSharif: Got the sad news while campaigning.
Our prayers and wishes for Imran Khan Sahib's early & complete recovery.
Hundreds of people gathered outside the Shaukat Khanum Hospital where Imran Khan was being treated.

Dr. Tahirul-Qadri (@TahirulQadri), who recently led a sizable crowd to protest against the outgoing Pakistan People's Party (PPP) government, stated:
@TahirulQadri: My heartfelt sympathy goes out to PTI chairman Imran Khan on sustaining injury.
I pray for his better health.
Rehman Malik (@SenRehmanMalik), former interior minister in the outgoing PPP government, tweeted:
@SenRehmanMalik: I pray for early recovery of Imran Khan.
May Allah bless him with fast recovery.
In Punjab, Khan's party is locked in a bitter political tussle with Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N). Despite this, PML-N head, Nawaz Sharif, expressed his grief over the incident and decided to stall his party's election campaign for a day, as a show of solidarity with Khan.
Many have gone on to claim that Khan has united a divided nation with his fall.
The incident, Hammad Siddiqui (@hammads) wrote, also hints that Pakistani politicians have matured:
@hammads: Altaf Bhai was the first one to cancel his address and prayed for Imran Khan - Followed by NS this shows political maturity #GetwellSoonIK
The incident has also triggered mass support and sympathy for Khan's political party, with many speculating that it may turn the tables in the party's favor.
Hassan Belal Zaidi (@mightyobvious_), a media consultant, penned a post titled "Fall to Grace" for Pak Votes. In his post, Zaidi wrote:
The truth is, Imran might just end up winning this one.
I can smell a victory for the Cricket Bat a mile away.
It may not be a massive win, it may not be a rout, but for a first time party, it will definitely be a victory.
I just hope that this (excuse the pun) knock on the head will be the wake-up call many in our country need.
I do not support the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, nor will I be voting for them.
But I do wish their party and their leader the best of luck.
While many have criticized Imran Khan for having rightist leanings, the unfortunate fall has yet again highlighted the fact that Khan has politically stirred the nation, especially the youth.
And when all is said and done, such mobilization is a very welcome change in a budding democracy.
Rafael Correa took power as President of the Republic of Ecuador to govern until 2017.
Correa took on his third term at the National Assembly before the heads of state of different Latin American and European countries, international delegations, assembly members, ministers, family members, and members of the governing party Alianza PAIS.
Correa and his Vice President Jorge Glas were sworn in before the President of the National Assembly, Gabriela Rivadeneira, on the morning of May 24, 2013.
In his inauguration speech President Rafael Correa promised to continue the social programs which his high levels of popularity have been based on.

Carlos Macas (@CarlosMacas19) mentioned one of the changes to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that Correa proposes : change the headquarters from Washington to a country in the region that has joined the American Convention on Human Rights (also known as the Pact of San José).
@CarlosMacas19: Rafael Correa "The headquarters of the IAHCR has to be in a country that has ratified the Pact of San Jose" #PosesiónPresidencial RT
But lawyer and political activist Luis A. Gaibor G. (@Luisgaiborg) asked:
@Luisgaiborg: What does it matter if #Ecuador signs all the Human Rights Pacts if it doesn't even respect the Right to Freedom of Expression #PosesionPresidencial
President Correa has a tense relationship with the media in the country.
In his speech he said that "the Latin American press, with honorable exceptions like always, is bad, very bad" and he claimed to be a victim of a "media lynching".
Nevertheless, as social communicator Edison Pérez (@edyelrojo) mentions, Correa added: “We defend the freedom of expression of all Ecuadorians and not only of certain groups”.
Luis Baque Gutiérrez (@baquelig) repeated the words of the president during the speech:
@baquelig: #PosesiónPresidencial This ECUADOR is not ready to be anyone's colony. Bravo @MashiRafael
@Jose_CastroS: so Ecuador is paradise? what about the crime, the drug trafficking, the killings? #PosesiónPresidencial#CorreistaPendejo
Finally, Elector Ecuador (@ElectorEcuador) , a citizen initiative that informed voters about the election candidates in the country, congratulated Correa and his vice president:

Five Yemenis convicted of murder and robbery were executed in Saudi Arabia and their bodies displayed in public in the southwestern town of Jizan.
The beheadings of the men, who were reportedly members of a gang, bring Saudi Arabia's total number of executions this year to 47.
Murder, armed robbery, drug trafficking, rape, and apostasy are capital offenses under the kingdom's Muslim Sharia law.
Yemen also has the death penalty and ranks sixth in the world when it comes number of executions, according to Amnesty International.
Saudi Arabia ranks fourth, behind China, Iran, and Iraq.
The United States ranks fifth.
Photos of the five corpses hanging from a rope high in the air tied to two cranes circulated on Twitter and Facebook on May 21, 2013 to the outrage of many users, including many Yemenis who were disturbed and enraged by the images of their executed countrymen.

In the piece, he observed how the Web was affecting the perception of Saudi Arabia's around the world:
The idea behind public executions is to deter others, though it's not at all clear that they do.
But nowadays, as a result of the internet, it is not just the Saudi public that sees them and this reinforces international perceptions that the kingdom is barbarous.
Quoting Amnesty International, he added:
.
Amnesty International says:
"Authorities in Saudi Arabia routinely flout international standards for fair trial and safeguards for defendants, who are often denied representation by lawyers and not informed of the progress of legal proceedings against them.
"They may be convicted solely on the basis of 'confessions' obtained under torture or other ill-treatment."

Information on the A Verdade newspaper.
Mkhuseli "Khusta" Jack is from South Africa and Oscar Olivera is from Bolivia; they come from different continents but they share one common story: they both challenged injustice and won.
In 1985, Khusta helped end racial apartheid by organizing a consumer boycott in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
Fifteen years later, in 2000, Olivera played a key role in a resistance movement that stopped the privatization of water in Cochabamba, Bolivia.
These two struggles, years and continents apart, are a testimony of the power of strategic organizing and non-violent civil resistance.
This year, Khusta and Olivera met in Mexico at the School of Authentic Journalism.
A group of scholars and professors from the school produced a video with their stories, which was recently released by Narco News TV.
Lawyer and human rights advocate Rumbidzai Dube, who helped produce the video, adds more detail about the two struggles:
Young and energetic, Khusta led an economic boycott of downtown white-owned businesses in Port Elizabeth to leverage black people’s demands for better treatment -humane treatment by the apartheid government of South Africa.
In the dizzying heights of Cochabamba, Bolivia, in 2000, Oscar Olivera together with others waged a popular resistance that came to be known as the Cochabamba Water Wars- a struggle against the privatisation of Bolivia’s water; including its rain water.
She concludes:
Both men mobilised, they rallied their people to take a stand, they stood their ground.
They took a risk; their activities were daring, after all they were dealing with life and death matters.
But what choice did they have?
Was a life without water a choice?
Was a life without freedom, dignity and justice a choice?
And so they sacrificed; not only their time and energy but their lives; and they both won.
Journalist Arzu Geybulla also met Khusta and Olivera.
She writes in her blog that both men are "inspirational just like their story."
Mexican blog Hazme el Chingado Favor posted a short commentary encouraging their readers to share the video:
This video is not a comedy like the others we've done, but we believe in its message so much that we are motivated to share it with the world and would like to ask for your support in spreading it.
The theme of the video is self-explanatory.
In early April, three MPs from the opposition political force “Svoboda” registered a bill that would ban abortions in Ukraine.
The only exceptions foreseen in the proposal included cases when the pregnancy threatened a woman’s life, when a fetus had grave pathologies, and when the pregnancy was proven to have resulted from rape.
This initiative comes only a year since the Ukrainian lawmakers’ last attempt to ban abortions.
In the explanatory note to the bill, the authors of the proposal justified the need for such restrictions with the following arguments :
Despite the declining tendency, the level of abortions in Ukraine remains among the highest in Europe and amounts to 21.1 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age; 45.8 abortions per 100 pregnancies or 84 abortions per 100 births.
It must be noted, that the following fact was not taken into consideration: according to a series of scientific medical researches, a child that is being aborted experiences the same level of suffering as a grown up person who is being tortured to death.
Moreover, abortions have negative consequences on the psychological and physical health of all those involved.
In most of Ukraine, the number of deaths is nearly three times the number of births.
During the last 20 years, the population of Ukraine has decreased by 5 million people (from 52 to 47 million).
If such demographic dynamics persist, in a few years immigrants, mostly from Asia, would constitute the majority of the Ukrainian people.
One of the major reasons behind such discontenting demographic tendencies is the legality of abortions.
The lawmakers also stressed the negative attitude toward abortions shared by all Christian churches of Ukraine.
The proposal has proven quite controversial and sparked active discussions both online and offline.
Many commentators immediately focused on the issue of proving the occurrence of rape in court.
Reporters of a major Ukrainian TV channel, TSN, noted that only 10 percent of rape charges become court cases and asked Olexandr Sych, one of the bill’s authors, what a woman should do if she became pregnant but failed to prove the fact of rape.
The MP replied :
I do not work in the law enforcement and do not know what a woman can or cannot prove… But first of all, should lead such a lifestyle as to not be exposed to the risk of rape.
In particular, drinking alcohol beverages in a questionable company.
This excerpt was widely circulated online and discussed on Facebook by regular users, journalists and activists.
User Serhiy Masliuchenko wrote :
This law is yet another attempt of the state and the bureaucrats to interfere with an individual’s life… when lack brains to do something about the economy, science, education, ecology, invent laws like this one
User Vasyl Martyuk disagreed :
I do not consider “Svoboda” to be a cure-for-all, but I support this bill!
Ukraine as one of the leaders in the number of abortions – this is terrible!
Facebook user Andrey Anthony wrote :
Before proposing such laws should restore the order in the country.
How can you propose such initiatives in a state where there aren’t even any roads, no rule of law, and endless corruption around?
User Elena Bondarenko wrote :
another opportunity for gynecologists to underground abortions!!!
Are there too few newborns found in dumpsters? Too few in ?
IDIOTS!!
Create social and economic conditions for parenthood, not restrictions!!!
User Marianna Goncharova commented :
This is one of those cases where gender-sensitive approach is needed.
Why is this issue being raised by men?
User Vitaliy Diachenko mocked the proposal :
Svoboda should adopt another law where their members are prohibited from having sex, unless they obtain a written document certifying that the sole intention behind this sexual act is .
User Yevgeniy Ikhelzon wondered why so little public reaction followed the introduction of the bill:
paradox, people who resent Muslims making women wear headscarves, calmly accept deputies attempting to ban abortions .
Journalist Iryna Slavinska criticized the proposal :
to fight the high numbers of unwanted pregnancies, sex education should be introduced in schools and there must be places where condoms and oral contraceptives are disseminated free of charge, instead of putting a ban on abortions.
Many users addressed the moral and ethical aspects of abortions.
In particular, such a discussion took place on the Facebook page of a physician and activist Evgeny Komarovsky.
User Yulia Zheleznova wrote :
Those commenting here, unfortunately, have not convinced me otherwise, but only strengthened my previously held convictions.
Regrettably, in our modern society there are so many women who do not consider not only the morals aspects of abortions, but even the elementary of their own health.
There are no arguments to justify murder.
Full stop.
Adding to the same discussion, user Olga Shandra wrote :
I think abortion is a choice of every individual woman, her moral and ethical principles, and definitely not the MPs, psychologists, public moralizers and so on.
User Enela Adonieva wrote :
I am against abortions.
But a woman should have a choice. And it is not to be made by politicians.
Currently, abortions in Ukraine are legal until the 12th week of pregnancy (the 22nd week in emergency cases).
Ukraine is one of the leading countries in Europe in the annual number of abortions, although there is a clear downward tendency.
“Abortion tourism” from the neighboring countries where the laws are more restrictive, such as Poland, has also been documented.

On the morning of Tuesday, May 28, 2013, thousands of workers, who are paid their wages for their work on a day to day basis, started a major protest in Zouérat, the capital of Tiris Zemmour state in north of Mauritania, demanding proper contracts and rights as well as ending the monopoly of businessmen over the Arab Mining Company (ARMICO).
The workers headed to the administrative headquarters of the state before anti-riot units suppressed the protest. The workers retaliated by occupying the state building, the premises of one of the contractor companies, as well as the state radio buildings.
The army intervened to control the situation and stop the workers protests.
Activist Magdy Ahmed tweeted about the escape of the governor of Tiris Zemmour after the workers protests :
@mejdmr: The governor, Ould Bahia, the deputy governor and the police ran away after witnessing the one-day workers anger when they occupied that governorate and state radio headquarters.
Update: Here is the full list of the 49 candidates for the presidential elections.
It does not include the current president of the transition.
As the deadline to submit candidacies for the Malagasy presidential elections ends today (28/04), a few surprising candidates have allegedly come forth.
While the earlier candidates were relatively new to the general public, a few prominent political players from the past are expected to contest: former president Didier Ratsiraka, current president of the transition Andry Rajoelina and the spouse of former president Ravalomanana, Lalao Ravalomanana.
One of the purest and most sacred holidays in Bulgaria!
It's a celebration that makes us proud to have given something to the world!
It's a holiday which is not related to any rebels, battles or violence, although it fills us with patriotism and joy.
When you walk on the streets, foreign signs and directions, they far exceed our domestic ones.
Noting with sadness about the ever-increasing use of the Latin script in Bulgaria, blogger Stranniche writes about The Day of the Bulgarian Education, Culture and Alphabet, a national holiday commemorating Saints Cyril and Methodius, to whom the creation of the oldest known Slavic alphabet - the Glagolitic alphabet - is attributed.
On this day, too, the third International Bulgarian Studies Congress began, bringing nearly 500 scholars from 34 countries to the University of Sofia.
An article published at mongabay.com exposes the destructive environment impact of mining in remote Indonesian towns.Some scholars fear that "parts of Indonesia now have the highest levels of mercury contamination on earth."
"Security considerations" are being cited as reasons behind new regulations which could put an end to the use of popular services such as Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and Tango in Bahrain.
Newspapers quoted Minister of State for Communication Fawaz bin Mohammed Al Khalifa as saying new regulations were being introduced for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications, which have become popular across the Gulf region, with millions of users exchanging news, views, photographs, and trivial jokes daily, as well as making free calls and connecting with friends and family.
Al Khalifa is quoted as saying:
The measures are meant to guarantee there is no clash with traditions and customs in addition to security considerations.
They are part of the efforts exerted by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to ensure the existence of regulations that preserve the rights of operators and that there is no abuse of communication applications.”
He said the move was to protect the country's communication sector, adding that a study showed that "100,000 people in Bahrain had used VoIP applications in four days."
Bahrain seems to be taking the cue from Saudi Arabia, which has already banned the use of Viber in the Kingdom.
Saudi Arabia blocked the instant messaging application on June 5, 2013, after it threatened to block encrypted communication software, unless it was allowed to spy on users.
Other services the Saudi authorities are threatening to block include Skype and mobile messaging service WhatsApp.
According to @Comms_BH, a verified Twitter account, which describes itself as the official account of the Ministry of State for Communications:
@CommsBH: Minister: MoSC is conducting a research study for the purpose of setting up controls over the usage of (VoIP) technology. #Bahrain
@CommsBH: The procedures comes in order to prevent any breaching of observable moral values and traditions as well as for security considerations.
@CommsBH: Legislations and regulations aim to ensure the protection of data and boost the security of international calls and telecom networks.
Online, netizens expressed dismay at the news.
Ahmedroid asks:
@albosta: Shall we kiss free VOiP goodbye #bahrain #skype #asterisk #previousTweet #viber
And Rasha Yousif adds:
@RshRsho: If @Comms_BH blocks viber, tango or Skype I’m burning tires #Bahrain
Burning tyres and blocking roads is a popular sign of protest in restive Bahrain, which has been witnessing almost daily protests since February 14, 2011.
On March 12, the World Day Against Cyber-Censorship, Reporters Without Borders named Bahrain as one of five state Enemies of the Internet - "spy states that conduct systematic online surveillance that results in serious human rights violations."
The other four are Syria, China, Iran and Vietnam.

Leila Hall blogs about the first-ever gay parade in Lesotho:
The event has been organised by MATRIX Support Group – a Lesotho-based NGO working to advocate for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals in the country.
The organisation, which only received legal recognition in 2010, is – like this year’s parade – the first of its kind in Lesotho.
Patrick Rajoelina argues that by law, if the president of the transition Andry Rajoelina still wants to run for the upcoming presidential elections in Madagascar, he can no longer be president, according to the road map signed by all Malagasy political parties in 2011.
The current prime minister Beriziky stated on 30/05 that Andry Rajoelina is no longer eligible to seat at the government meetings because he should have already resigned from his position.
Several netizens tweeted about the second presidential debate and made laugh of candidates.
Potkin Azarmehr tweeted "Pres Candidates may be asked to play musical chairs next."
A protest organized by three groups affiliated with the Israeli social justice movement (#j14) was held in Jerusalem on Saturday night (June 8).
The protesters demanded a reversal of the decision to export most of Israel's natural gas reserves with only 12.5% of the value of the gas going to the State in taxes.
The protesters also voiced objections against the budget of the new government, which is expected to significantly raise taxes on Israel's lower and middle-class, while at the same time cutting government services on which those classes rely.
The protest, despite being peaceful and rather small (a few hundreds of protesters) was met with an unusually high level of random police brutality.
Leftist activist Ben Marmara tweeted a series of updates throughout the protest:
Policemen are beating up women, they should be jailed.
There are a number of female and male detainees in Jerusalem. #j14 Police keep arresting people and piling them into police vans.
Just like the protest in Ramat Gan , once again, the police broke the law and forcefully prevented a protest.
Then they arrested protesters.
Jerusalem-based #j14 activist, Yishai Oltchik, posted this update on Facebook:
So today I can mark the first time when a cop kicked me.
Attacked me, I mean.
Why?
Simply because I stood with a sign calling the Knesset to hold hearings regarding the export of natural gas....
I did not talk to the cop... did not look at him directly.
I did not even film him, which is legal but usually ends in assault .
I just stood there and then he arrived, forcefully pushed the girl who held the sign with me (throwing her on her back), and on the way, kicked me....
I went to a nearby police officer and told him that the cop kicked me for no reason; he just smiled and kept walking.
...
The thing that makes me so angry is knowing that this is not something out of the ordinary.
I saw at least 10 other people being pushed and kicked by policemen, and one or two violent arrests.
Tel Aviv-based #j14 activist Orly Bar-Lev posted this image on Facebook and wrote:
Right to left: "Bibi - stop the economic terrorism!Orly in the center: "Export of gas = suicide for the state" and "No to the cut in child stipends"
Hundreds of law-abiding and peaceful concerned citizens who came to protest against the austerity measures, the economic situation and the export of gas were met with violent and completely disproportional police treatment.
Policemen on horses???
Beating up women???
A protester who was run over by a cop on a motorcycle???
What is wrong with you?
Who gave the order to stop this protest violently and repress the right to protest?
Who gave the order to stop a democratic rally from reaching the home of the Prime Minister?
Who is responsible for this madness?
Andrea Radu re-posted Orly's update and added:
In the only democracy in the Middle east, peaceful protesters get run over, beaten and arrested because they attempted to exercise their democratic right to protest.

The protest and police brutality did not receive a great deal of coverage and Israeli media and activists complained about biased reporting.
Naminag who was at the protest tweeted:
Ynet says that policemen used "reasonable force".
Really?
Because I saw a protester being pushed down a flight of stairs and rolling down, a policemen who ran over a protester with his motorcycle and a policemen wearing a helmet who headbutted a protester.
And all of this before we even marched 100 meters.

Macedonian journalists gathered in front of the Criminal Court in the capital Skopje today to protest against the arrest of their colleague, Tomislav Kezarovski, according to this note posted in the Macedonian Facebook group titled "Journalists and citizens in defense of the right to freedom of information."
It appears that the official reason for Kezarovski's 30-day detention is a story he wrote five years ago for a publication that no longer exists.
On the other hand, he has been investigating the death of Nikola Mladenov, publisher and editor of an independent media outlet, for the past two months.
Although the official cause of Mladenov's death is a "classic traffic accident," much remains unclear in the case.
Kezarovski wrote an article about Mladenov's last hours, based on the evidence found by the Nova Makedonija daily's team, revealing that after the police left the heavily-guarded crime scene, much evidence was left there, including paid toll bills and parts of the vehicle.
Small groups of Saudi women held simultaneous "Sit-ins for Freedom" across Saudi cities on June 10, 2013, which were called for by anonymous advocacy group @almonaseron to call for release of their imprisoned relatives.
As a result, over 140 protesters, men and women, were arrested by Saudi forces during the previous two days.
At 4.55pm, local time, @almonaseron announced the beginning of the sit-in and tweeted :
@almonaseron: The Sit-in for Freedom just started: women from different areas simultaneously.
Detainees' relatives should join them right now.
In Riyadh, a group of women, several of whom were relatives of Suliman al-Roushodi, head of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, gathered in front of the government-funded National Society for Human Rights, where they had protested back in February.
One of the protesters was his daughter, Bahia al-Roushodi, who was given a suspended four-month prison sentence after that earlier sit-in.
They were quickly surrounded by over 30 police cars , and their driver was arrested and they were prohibited from leaving.
One of Riyadh's main roads, King Fahad Road, was closed by police during rush hour to crackdown on the sit-in.
At 6.20pm, one of the protesters, al-Roushodi's wife, tweeted:
@omamar1: They arrested us, and they arrested my brother.
Relatives of the arrested women protesters gathered in front of the prison where they were reportedly held.

At 11.44pm, relatives of the arrested women protesters gathered in front of the prison where they were reportedly held. al-Roushodi's granddaughter, Fatima al-Mesned tweeted:
@fatma_mesned: For those who want to demand the protesters: We are now in front of al-Malez prison, the female section.
Support those who supported our prisoners.
@almonaseron: Women were just forced to ride the buses.
The following day, June 11, at 5pm, a group of men and women gathered to protest the previous day's arrests.
Within minutes, they were surrounded by emergency forces , beaten and arrested.
Other small gathers were held in Mecca, Aljouf and Hial.

The sentencing of 43 Egyptian and foreign employees in non-governmental organisations to jail terms of up to five years, has sparked anger on social media networks - and on the ground.
The move is seen as a warning for human rights organisations, and those promoting democracy.
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia explains:
It is just sad because NGOs played an extremely important role in Egypt when it comes to development and foreign funding played a role in this.
What is even more sadder is how the Egyptian NGOs workers and employees are being punished in this way.
Those Egyptian women and men may not find a job in Egypt easily when they are officially convicted in a political case like this.
Of course the world is not stupid , it understands what happened and is happening.
It happened before with TV channels like Orbit, Dream TV and Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr.
Of course it is worth to mention that the Muslim brotherhood is walking on the same path like Mubarak regime and SCAF.
This is another setback to human rights in Egypt and actually it will not encourage people to come to the country or invest in it.
I believe this verdict will also be a setback in the relation between the United States and the Muslim brotherhood as well EU and the Muslim brotherhood.
On Twitter, netizens reacted with shock.
Sally Sami tweets:
@Salamander: In utter shock of the #NGOtrial verdict!!
No one should be imprisoned simply for working for an NGO ... #NGO #ngocrackdown
Lina El Wardani comments:
@linawardani: Shocked & terrified by the #NGOtrial verdict 11 sentenced to 1 year suspended 5 to two years and 27 5 years in absentia, 4 NGOs closed
Bel Trew notes:
@Beltrew: #NGO trial was spear-headed by a Mubarak-era minister under #SCAF rule, individuals were on trial NOT organisations for being unregistered
And Mona Eltahawy adds:
@monaeltahawy: "Justice" in #Egypt: jail time for defendants in politically motivated #ngotrial, acquittals for regime figures/police who killed protesters
Ghada Shahbender laments :
@ghadasha: The real tragedy is that 99 per cent of Egyptians will accept the ruling to jail the NGO employees and will be happy for curtailing "foreign interference", which is being promoted
@ghadasha:... by the Mubarak regime, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the Muslim Brotherhood - who all get international aid and beg the international community.
They have promoted the idea of "foreign interference" and then abused it to crackdown
One of the defendants, Robert Becker, who was sentenced to two years and was the only foreign defendant to remain in Egypt during the trial, said he was forced into "exile" after the verdict was announced.
He tweeted:
@rbecker51: Safely out of #Egypt.
On my lawyers advice, I have unwillingly and angrily gone into exile until appeals get sorted out. #NGOtrial
In two previous tweets, he explains:
@rbecker51: Thank you everyone for the kind words.
Reviewing my legal/appeals options with lawyers #NGOtrial
@rbecker51: #pt Maintaining my innocence on charges of starting NGO six years before I actually arrived in Egypt & waiting for appeal strategy #NGOtrial
Sally Sami concludes :
@Salamander: We really are entering black days .. when people are sentenced to jail just for working in NGOs
For more reactions, check out the hashtags #ngocrackdown and #ngotrial.
According to news reports and their own Twitter accounts, the defendants will appeal the sentence.

A young man was killed after he was hit by a car in Ribeirao Preto and dozens were hurt in confrontations with the police in Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador as more than a million people took to the streets of large and small cities throughout Brazil in the biggest protests seen in the country in two decades.
The national force had also been deployed to Belo Horizonte and Fortaleza, the other cities hosting games in FIFA's Confederations Cup, and helped counter the protests on June 20, 2013.
Despite the focus on violence, the majority of the demonstrations were peaceful.
In this second week of national protests, which began over a rise in bus fare prices, the demonstrations happened in more than 100 places despite the reduction of bus fare in many cities, including major capitals such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, showing that “it was not just about 20 cents”.

A country at war?
Contrary to what the mainstream media has been broadcasting, some of the protesters were trying to mobilize others to go to Congress; There are two bridges/entries and one of them had a higher concentration of vandals.
It turns out that we were all surprised with tear bombs and rubber bullets; One protester close was shot directly in his thigh, and had a bullet lodged until he was taken away by the fire brigate.
In Salvador, protesters faced much violence in a march that began peaceful.
The demonstration turned sour when the crowd advanced towards the local stadium, where Uruguay was playing against Nigeria for the Confederations Cup.
An official local government car with plate number OKU 8877 was taped firing gun shots – according to the author of the video, Felipe Amorim , it was not rubber bullet.
The video has thousands of shares and comments, among which witness Berlindo Ribeiro Reis, who confirmed:
I was there and saw it all.
The police came down beating up and throwing grenades in everyone, they didn't want to know whether it was children, pregnant woman
In Rio de Janeiro, conflicts between police and protesters were also registered by citizen reporters.
Some netizens claimed that real weapons were used against people throughout the city.
Chico Freitas reported on Facebook:
Today, Rio was at war.
One million protesters took to the streets.
The police attacked without sympathy, before we were even able to do any other thing besides protesting, there was no vandalism.
They surrounded us at the city center.
They used lethal and non-lethal weapons, they closed the metro stations and oppressed those who were trying to catch the ferry.
They threw bombs at us, from the city hall to the Sambadrome, they trapped us at Avenida Presidente Vargas, we were able to go to Praça Tiradentes and there we saw on the TV in a bar, the riot troops were going there.
We run towards Lapa and learned they were throwing tear gas even at the children who were playing there, so we went via Avenida Chile to Cinelandia.
There, people were gathering again in front of Municipal Theater.
Until the Riot Police’s vehicles got closer and threw bombs. I got lost from my friends.
We all run to Flamengo’s area.
There, I saw a bus to Niteroi and embarked on it.
From the bus, I saw they were throwing teargas there as well.
The police will never allow anyone to go anywhere, wherever people go, they will follow with oppression.
Today, the police was more violent than ever.
They were truculent, atrocious, they brought fear and terror.
The police, that is paid to protect the people. #protestorj #ogiganteacordou #revoltadovinagre #thegiantwokeup #vemprarua #changebrazil #rio #brasil#brazil

This post is part of our Special Coverage: Reformists on Trial in Saudi Arabia
Abdulkareem al-Khadar, a founding member of the Kingdom's defiant leading human rights organisation, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), was sentenced to eight years in prison for inciting public opinion and establishing an unlicensed human rights organization among other charges, five years of which to be suspended and applied only if the activist participates in any illegal assembly or association after his release.
Today's session was held in the Saudi Arabian city of Buraydah and it was attended by tens of ACPRA supporters, but the judge allowed no women, saying that "men are good enough."
The first hearing session in Dr. al-Khadar's trial was on February 20th, when he asked the judge to withdraw from the case because of a previous personal conflict that they had had, but the judge refused.
The same judge, Ibrahim al-Husni, previously sentenced peaceful protesters to be flogged.

Back in March, two other prominent human rights activists and co-founders of ACPRA were found guilty and sentenced to 10 and 11 years in jail for “breaking allegiance to the ruler and his successor” and “trying to impede the country’s developments”.
After today's session, al-Khadar's lawyer and ACPRA member Abdualziz al-Shubaily was held by police forces after a secret police member had accused him of "inappropriate behavior."
He was shortly released:
@a_abdulaziz300: I was just released from the Southern Police Station after a secret police member had accused me of inappropriate behavior toward him.
Following the session, Saudi Twitter users started a hashtag: (#أنا_عضو_حسم) (I am an ACPRA member), where they wrote their names to declare their full support of ACPRA's positions and demands of political reforms.

The fourth protest of the Free Fare Movement, which took place this Thursday, June 13, in São Paulo was met with police repression in the form of pepper spray, rubber bullets and tear gas.
According to the latest news, at least 235 people were arrested during the protests.
Nearly five thousand protesters gathered in front of the Municipal Theater as part of continued protests against the bus fare increase from 3.00 BRL (1.40 USD) to 3.20 BRL (1.50 USD).
Protests have been ongoing since June 6 in response to the increase that was put into effect four days earlier.
The case has already gained international attention.
The movement has been using a Facebook page to organize, and demonstrations have followed in other Brazilian state capitals that are also protesting fare increases for public transportation.
Journalists and other opinion leaders have been discussing the fare increase in the national media, while citizens have been expressing their opinions through the internet.
The protesters, who suffered police brutality during the protests, were referred to as “vandals”, by Governor Geraldo Alckmin and criticized by Mayor Fernando Haddad (currently in Paris).
Nonetheless, both the state and city governments confirmed they will maintain fare increase.
The video below shows the police attacking members of the press.

The ethnic violence in Myanmar seems to be spreading in nearby countries.
Some Myanmar Buddhist migrants in Malaysia have been attacked in recent weeks which many people believe are related to the ongoing ethnic and religious tension in Myanmar.
According to Eleven Media, 6 died and 12 were hospitalized with injuries during the violent attacks against Myanmar nationals in Malaysia from May 30 to June 8.
Myanmar's Embassy in Malaysia initially dismissed the news which angered many Burmese netizens.
Ye Htut, Myanmar's Deputy Minister of Ministry of Information clarified the report:
(We) read the news on the Internet about the clashes near a Myanmar monastery at KamPung and Selayang and that some Myanmar nationals died.
(We) immediately asked the Myanmar Embassy in Malaysia about this issue at 5 pm and again at 8 pm via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Ambassador said the news was false.
A Myanmar national put 11 red roses in front of Malaysia's Embassy in Yangon in honor of Myanmar migrants killed in Malaysia.
Photo - Ye Moe's Facebook.
Wai Lin Oo expressed his frustration with the Embassy's response:
And they charge us extreme taxes.
I can't even mention in words how they often reprimand ( citizens who are seeking refuge in the Embassy). When can we depend on Myanmar government?
It's really discouraging.
Myo Set compared how the governments of other countries are behaving when faced with a similar situation: When a Japanese was killed in 2007 in Myanmar, a Japan Minister came at once.
When Myanmar workers had issues with a Korean factory owner, the Korean Embassy suddenly became involved in the case.
North Korea cleared away the books about Kim Jong Ill from book shops in Myanmar.
What a shame!
US came down to Myanmar once there were issues of Yettaw.
Our turn?
In Malaysia, the Ambassador's mouth got a stroke.
Ministry of Information is crippled and Myanmar government is paralyzed.
We are Burmese, a community page of Myanmar citizens around the world questioned the silence of NGOs and media regarding the abuses suffered by Buddhists in Malaysia:
When riots in Meikhtilar Township in Myanmar happened, (the global) media and international organizations (like the) UN, Human Rights Watch (reported) about it and some even exaggerated the (situation), labeling it ethnic cleansing, genocide, Muslims in Myanmar are being brutally massacred, or something like that....But why are they silent than normal about the current massacre in Malaysia targeting Myanmar Buddhists?
How many lives must the Burmese Buddhists sacrifice further to put the (situation) on pages and screens?
Please show the so-called RIGHTS you all repeatedly use whenever you get every chance to make the Burmese Buddhists dishonorable in every page and every screen worldwide.
On June 4, when voices became louder and attacks became more serious, the Myanmar government issued an Aide Memoire to Malaysia's Ambassador in Myanmar urging the Malaysian government to investigate the issue immediately and take legal actions against responsible persons.
On June 6, Malaysia reported that 900 Myanmar nationals were detained during a security sweep.
Myanmar government is preparing to send a team of special representatives to Malaysia.
Since some of the injured Myanmar migrants cannot afford the hospital bills, the Malaysia Kampung Free Funeral Service Social Team (Kampung FFSS) gave donation to the victims.
U Aung Ko Win, President of the Kanbawza Bank who also runs Myanmar Airways International (MAI) donated $50,000 US dollars and cut the MAI air ticket fees of the Malaysia-Myanmar route by 50% for the convenience of migrants who wish to go back to Myanmar.
Another well-known wealthy personnel, U Zaw Zaw, who is President of Myanmar Football Federation announced that he will donate 1,000 air tickets for those who want to go back to Myanmar, plus additional $20,000 US dollars donation to Kampung FFSS.
Many netizens on Facebook changed their profile pictures to black to grieve the deaths of Myanmar citizens in Malaysia.

At the end of 2012, the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture made public its plans to provide free mobile phones to rural farmers.
According to this report:
Ibukun Idusote, Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, was reported as saying that the Federal Ministry of Agriculture would procure ten million mobile phones, worth about N60 billion, from China and the US for free distribution to rural farmers across the country.
This triggered reverberations in the Nigerian blogosphere.
Kikiowo Ileowo asks where the government got the statistics – that warrants 10 million mobile phones for 10 million farmers – from:
The question… is where exactly are the 10million farmers?
Are they from the army of the unemployed 16, 074, 295 or from the already employed 51, 181, 884.
If their answer is the former, what exactly are they producing that Nigeria has not become a hub of everything food?
Now, understand that a large portion of food production in Nigeria is done through mechanized farming which makes use of less manual labour.
The 'farmers' Mr. President wants to provide handset for are subsistent farmers who produce what they mostly consume in their homes.
I have a garden at the back of my house; does that qualify me as a recipient of the 'Jona-phone'?
I see no reason why the president in conjunction with his minister of Agriculture would insult the collective intelligence of Nigerians by playing to the gallery with a noble idea that has revolutionised countries like Uganda, Kenya and India.
There has since been a correction on the real cost of the phones:
…the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, has corrected the report that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mrs. Ibukun Odusote, said the phones would be bought by the government at the cost of N60 billion, his explanation that the phones will be supplied to farmers through Public/Private Sector partnership…
Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture
Dr Adesina, the Minister of Agriculture rose up in defence of the project.
In a press release he says:
When I came on board as minister of agriculture in July of 2011, I found a corrupt and totally inefficient fertilizer sector. The government was spending huge amounts of money on direct procurement and distribution of subsidized fertilizer, but less than 11% of farmers got the fertilizers.
Some of the fertilizers paid for by government were never delivered to the warehouses.
Some of the fertilizer delivered contained more sand than fertilizer while a large portion of the fertilizer subsidized by government found its way across our borders to neighbouring countries where it was sold at prevailing market prices.
This technology-mediated solution, he asserts, ended the corruption associated with fertilizer distribution:
We ended four decades of corruption in the fertilizer sector within 90 days of my assumption of office as minister.
How did we do this?
We were able get subsidized high quality fertilizer and seeds to our rural farmers by introducing the GES (Growth Enhancement Support) scheme in April of 2012.
The GES scheme delivers inputs (fertilizers and seeds) to farmers directly by using farmers' cell phones.
We created an electronic platform (e-wallet) on which we registered farmers and agro dealers who own shops that sell farm inputs all over the country.
To date we have registered 4.2 million farmers and about 900 agro dealers.
The Minister thinks that although many Nigerian farmers are illiterate but are able to use mobile telephones:
Some people think that our farmers are uneducated and cannot use cell phones.
The evidence does not support that.
Under the GES scheme, we made it possible for farmers to transact business in their own local languages using their cell phones.
From data we collected based on farmers’ use of cell phones to access fertilizers and seeds last year, we found that the total number of transactions done by phone with respect to the GES scheme was 4.9 million.
Of these, 1.2 million were in English, 620,000 were in Pidgin, 2.2 million were in Hausa, and 854,000 were in Yoruba and 344 were in Igbo.
From this data, we have no doubt that our farmers are well able to use cell phones.
Technology, according to the Dr Adesina, aided his judgement that there would be no food crisis after floods swept through some parts of the country:
When the floods occurred, there was panic in the land... I was not moved.
We used modern technology to guide our decision.
Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, we mapped out the extent of the flood and determined that no more than 1.17% of our total cultivated area was affected by the floods.
Our detractors wanted the world to believe the opposite, that food crisis was imminent.
They were wrong.
Today, five months after the floods, we do not have a food crisis.
Nonetheless, some netizens still have unanswered questions.
Olusola Adegbeti asks:
One must then poignantly ask, though it be a rhetorical question, if the purchase and distribution of GSM phones to hundreds of farmers spread across the length and breadth of a country so large as Nigeria is the most critical and challenging of issues bedevilling the Nigerian agricultural sector at the moment?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Running on the heels of the above, it is convenient to say that one does not need the wisdom of Solomon or the prophetic insight of Isaiah to be led in the direction of the myriad of issues that have since rendered the agricultural sector beggarly, issues such as lack of easy access to land for farming, absence of reliable and corruption-free financial institutions to empower farmers acquire the required modern machinery for mechanised and commercial farming that is usually the backbone of every nation, lack of easy access to requisite technology and agro-chemical support-structure for sustained annual and perennial farming as well as animal husbandry....
The Sun asks if farmers really need new mobile phones, when they already have one or have other sources of information?
The telephone is also clearly not the best way to reach farmers who mostly live in the rural areas.
Rural information centres, traditional communication models and the radio are much better channels.
There are also many more direct initiatives through which the government can boost agricultural production in the country, than provision of telephones.
More importantly, the government does not need to buy telephones for farmers because those among them who could use such phones, already have them.
With handsets selling for as low as between N2000 and N3000 in the country, any farmer that is worth the name can afford to own one, and most likely has one already.
If they do not, what the government needs to do is to empower them to be able to afford such a basic tool.
Disu Kimor thinks that it’s another white elephant project:
Such white elephant projects will only reinforce the perception of Nigeria as a laughing stock of the rest of the world where we like to teach the blind sign language.
Any developing country such as Nigeria, wishing to develop its agricultural sector will focus direct government intervention to help farmers and boost food production on achieving steady supply of working capital, improve research and development, water supply, ensure low cost of fuel and labour, (corruption-free) subsidy on farming equipment and basic infrastructure.
Disu concludes:
One day, posterity will judge the quangos and political leaders of this country whose main pre-occupation is keeping the country on its knees or embezzle and waste much needed public funds.
The trial of Tunisian FEMEN activist Amina Tyler, who was arrested on May 19 after she graffitied the word FEMEN on the wall of cemetery in Kairouan, 184km from the capital Tunis, will resume on June 5.
Amina's lawyers argued that she had the pepper spray for self-defense reasons, following the death threats she received last March, after she posted topless photographs of herself on Facebook.
Though she avoided a six-month jail-term for this charge, Amina remains in custody and now faces new charges: "undermining public morals", "desecrating a cemetery" and "belonging to a criminal organization" .
These charges could land the 19-year-old in jail for several years.
On 31 May, Amnesty International called upon the Tunisian authorities to release Amina.
The organization described the charges as "politically motivated and targeting her for her activism on women's rights".
Silence of the so called "Democrats"?
The secular Tunisian opposition's lack of support to Amina, was met with criticism.
Fearing to lose the future votes of the conservative electorate, it seems that leftist politicians have preferred to remain silent.
This is not the first time political parties from the left faced accusations of letting down their own "progressive" values.
For instance, they were also accused of adopting a weak stance on the case of Ghazi Beji and Jabeur Mejir, who were convicted to seven and half years in prison last year, over the publication of online content deemed offensive to Islam.
In the Avaaz petition demanding the release of Amina, the support committee for the young FEMEN activist said :
Amina is back in prison!
We were all deluded by the announcement that Amina was released over the possession of an incendiary object.
Amina is the prisoner of the Tunisian political hypocrisy and the silence of those claiming to be democrats but do not dare to take sides in this ongoing battle.
Tunisian writer Gilbert Naccache also criticized the proclaimed democrats' stance:
It is really hard for democracy to make its way to our brains!
Those claiming to be ready to fight until the end for freedom, (...) are denouncing an intolerable provocation when Amina expressed herself(...)
The pretexts used to condemn Amina, even by those who accused her of distracting attention away from the real problems or further dividing Tunisians, are in fact only finding a way not to assume their duty which is supporting Amina against slander and lies,(...) and supporting every individual's right to express him/herself in his/her own way.
Three other FEMEN activists, two French and one German are also set to stand trial on June 5.
They each face a six-month imprisonment after they staged a topless protest outside a Tunis-based court on May 29 in support of Amina.

Two young Saudi men were arrested in the capital Riyadh by the Committee of the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) for allegedly insulting religion.
Bader Al-Rasheed @BAlrasheed and Abdullah Al-Bilasi @3bdlla shared their story on Twitter.
According to Al-Rasheed, they were sitting outside a cafe when a CPVPV's car passed by to call people to leave the area to perform evening prayers.
He said he argued with the CPVPV member whether sitting at public places at prayer times was illegal.
Al-Rasheed later tweeted :
"@BAlrasheed: Because it was the first time I hear of this law and the heya’ (what CPVPV is informally referred to) acts arbitrarily sometimes, I went to their car and asked: is there a law that bans sitting in public places at prayer times?”
The employee’s answer was that it’s haram (religiously forbidden), but Al-Rasheed interrupted saying:
"@BAlrasheed: Don't tell me what religion says, is there a law?
Religion is a matter of personal choice.
It's the law that I have to abide by."
According to Al-Rasheed, the employee was irritated and asked for his and his friend's identification cards.
Then, the CPVPV member started threatening them and inciting the police official to take action against them.
Minutes later, another CPVPV car and a police car came to arrest them and took them to al-Sulaimaniyah police station.
Al-Bilasi talked about the inhumane conditions in the cells: "It was small and overcrowded.
There weren't any beds or mattresses,” he says. “We slept on the floor.
I asked an officer to let me sleep in the hallway but he just cursed me," he adds.
The next morning, they were taken, handcuffed, to the Investigation and Prosecution Bureau.
Upon arriving there, they were taken to a small room where they waited for hours before they were called separately for investigation.
The investigator told Abdullah that CPVPV members and police officers are “not to be argued with but obeyed.”
Their nightmare came to an end when they were released after their parents bailed them out even though the investigator called what happened a "misunderstanding."
Religious police were not satisfied and demanded that the two men get tried.
More absurdly, al-Bilasi and al-Rasheed reported a strange story about a Lebanese man they met in al-Sulaimaniyah police station who was arrested for a “religiously illegitimate smile”!
@balrasheed: One of the more bizarre stories we came across during our detention was of a Lebanese salesman who was sentenced to five days imprisonment.
His crime: "A non-Sharia compliant smile."

Francisco J. P. Chuquela, a collaborator of Global Voices' partner @Verdade Newspaper in Mozambique, reported this story for Global Voices
Health professionals in Mozambique have been on strike for ten days leading to the halt of operations in many medical units throughout the country.
The dispute with the government is based on demands for wage increase and standardisation, as well as the readjustment of the emergency room prices throughout the country's hospitals.
It is the second strike of the sector to take place in the country in 2013, only this time the protest of the doctors has expanded to more health professionals and has extended now for a second week.
Emotions peaked on Sunday night, May 26, 2013 when the President of Associação Médica de Moçambique, Dr. Jorge Arroz, was arrested by police under accusation of sedition (incitement of discontent or rebellion against a government).
The release of Arroz a few hours later was fueled by massive popular mobilisation in front of the police station combined with the presence of mainstream media and the intervention of jurists.
Tomás Queface, a student of sociology, summarised on his blog Política e Tecnologia how Mozambicans immediately questioned on social media the reasons behind Arroz's detention and commented on the lack of freedom of expression in the country.
On Monday morning, May 27, health professionals met at the Cineteatro Gilberto Mendes, holding empty plates on their hands.

Government's counter-information
Analysts believe that the arrest of Arroz has increased the participation of health professionals in the strike.
"Reports on the percentage of participating strikers range from 90 to five percent of the medical workforce", Aljazeera's The Stream reported on May 28.
On May 28, a citizen reported that health professionals were meeting in Beira's Central Hospital.
Throughout the first week of the strike, as the spokesman of the Ministry of Health said that all health units had returned to normality, citizen and independent reporters stated that there were many restrictions in some of the major medical units.
Citizens and journalists in Maputo sent their reports from several hospitals and health unites: consultations were delayed, and patients were being received and screened by students, military doctors, foreigners and international organisations such as the Red Cross.
Other professionals, who usually occupy positions of leadership outside the units, were performing more specialized services.
Acts of intimidation
Hospital directors tried to mobilize health professionals to work, but to no avail.
An audio recording shared by the Medical Association of Mozambique on Facebook on May 21 revealed the Director of Mozambique's largest hospital threatening and intimidating healthcare professionals:
Thirty-six Azeri activists including one blogger, Kiaksar, were arrested on Thursday, 27 June in Urmia.
Security forces released 300 of these activists after a few hours of interrogation.
Al Jazeera has come under fire in Egypt for what many describe as its "biased" reporting during and following the ousting of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi on July 4.
The Qatar-based channel is being accused of siding with the Muslim Brotherhood and being its mouthpiece.
After Morsi was removed from office by the Army, Al Jazeera's Live Egypt service, Al Jazeera Mubasher, was immediately taken off air.
The network announced:
Al Jazeera's live Egypt service have been taken off air along with several other TV channels.
Reports from our correspondents say this happened during a live broadcast when security forces stormed the building and arrested the presenter, guests and producers.
Two days later, the Downtown Cairo prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for the channel's news director Abdel Fattah Fayed.
Fayed is being charged with "threatening public peace and national security through broadcasting incendiary news."
He was detained for two days and then released on bail.
On 8 July, mass resignation of 22 staff members took place over what they claimed to be "coverage that was out of sync with real events in Egypt."
Other reports say that 26 Egyptian employees have resigned, including four in the main Doha office.
One of the reporters, Wesam Fadhel reportedly resigned in a Facebook post .
The note reads:
I resigned from Al Jazeera today.
It's lying openly.
They are showing old footage from an empty Tahrir and saying it was taken a short while ago and they are airing the scenes for hours.
When I asked Ahmed Abu Al Mahasen for the reason he said that I should mind my own business.

China has put into effect a new law this week requiring grown children to visit their parents “frequently”.
It is strong tradition in China to respect the elderly and take care of parents as they get older, but modern lifestyles has meant that young people leave home for their own love and career.
The new law says adults should care about their parents "spiritual needs" and "never neglect elderly people", but it doesn't specify how often they need to visit the parents or what punishment they will receive if they fail to abide.
The law is designed as China's population ages rapidly due to the one-child policy.
The journal reported that more than 14 percent of China’s population, or 194 million people, are over 60 years old, according to the most recent figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.
By 2030, that figure will double.
Moreover, since 2012, China’s pension system has been in crisis with a shortfall of 2.9 trillion US dollars.
Young Chinese are worried that they are being asked to support government retirees.
The new law has triggered ridicule on China's most popular microblogging website Sina Weibo, with many quipping that the enforcement of the law is questionable and visiting parents should be a moral issue to be encouraged rather than a law that should be enforced.
Some complained that they can't get enough time off from work to visit their parents even if they wanted to, while others thought that the law was introduced to make up for China's brewing pension issue.
Online personality “Zhuomo Xiansheng” wrote sarcastically:
Family bonds should be based on spontaneous emotions.
It's funny to make it part of a law; it's like requiring couples to have a harmonious sex life after marriage.
Lawyer Yang Lei echoed the same sentiment: The question is how to enforce the law? For example, give the parents a fingerprint attendance machine?
"Yu linfeng" speculated China's unfair social security is one of the reasons for introducing the law: Social security is mostly for the civil servants, most ordinary people don't have any much pension to rely on.
TV host Cao Baoying thought that the law is a way for the government to avoid its own responsibility :
By introducing the law, emphasizing the one-sided civic duty, while weakening the government responsibilties.
An ifeng news commentary piece concluded :
Introducing the law to promote filial piety can be effective in forcing children to visit their parents, but if their external pressure can not be reduced, how meaningful is the helpless "filial piety"?
How are we supposed to feel about the dignity of the law?
Global Voices and the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) have launched a new partnership that will combine Global Voices’ focus on citizen media and NACLA’s analysis and expertise to bring our readers original, in-depth coverage about the region.
NACLA, founded in 1966, is an independent, nonprofit organization that seeks to “foster knowledge beyond borders” by providing information and analysis on Latin America and its complex relationship with the United States:
“We believe that knowledge is essential for change, so we use a unique combination of information/media activism and popular education to provide people the tools they need to understand the world in order to change it”
Every month, GV and NACLA authors will work together to provide content related to a specific topic.
A podcast with interviews, analysis, and additional reporting on the issues analyzed in the posts will be available at the end of the month.
Migrant Journeys
We begin our partnership with the theme “Migrant Journeys.”
In July we will be covering a wide range of issues related to migration: from the immigration bill that is currently being discussed in the United States Congress, to the human stories behind migrants’ dangerous trek north through Central America and Mexico.

Twenty-two children between four and 12 years old at a public primary school in the Indian state of Bihar are dead after eating contaminated mid-day meals on July 16, 2013.
Many more in the poor, rural village of Chapra were hospitalized in serious condition.
The food is believed to have been poisoned by pesticides.
The tragedy was the worst incident in a rash of apparently tainted school lunches.
In a separate incident in Bihar's Madhubani district, 15 students fell ill after eating mid-day meals.
In Gaya-Bihar, one student was killed after eating school lunch there.
And in another separate incident in Dhule in the district of Maharashtra, 31 children were hospitalized after having their mid-day meals.
A student at a government-funded Hindi school in outskirts of Mumbai, India, 2011.
The mid-day meal scheme, which began in the 1960's, is one of India's oldest and aims to encourage marginalized classes to send their children to schools.
Besides the education, a meal for every student is given as an incentive for enrollment.
However, ever since the start of the scheme, reports of embezzlement of food meant for children have consistently surfaced.
A 2006 news report found that students of a primary school in Darjeeling were deprived of their meals for 18 months.
The issue has, as expected, taken a political twist.
The political party in power has alleged that the opposition has indulged in a conspiracy to frame them.
The school principal's husband is reported to be a political figure who was responsible for supplying food to the school.
The negligence on the part of the government angered many on social networking sites.
India-based Twitter user Vikram Singh (@cynicalvs) wrote:
@cynicalvs: How can kids die of eating a midday meal?
It is food.
Somebody needs to be tried for murder. #chappra
As soon as journalists began reaching hospitals to report on the situation, more mismanagement came to surface.
The streamed video images showed surviving children laid next to each other crammed on a desk and saline water being administered.

@r_verma: School teachers serve mid day meal to children as if they are doing some big personal favour to them. #Chhapra
Fazal Abbas (@fazlabas), a Mumbai-based Twitter user, brought some historical perspective to the ongoing discourse:
@fazlabas: Chhapra is same as our first president Dr. Rajendra Prasad left half century back.
Children are dying for education.
Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi), a former police officer from Delhi who is recognized for her philanthropic activities and anti-corruption crusade in India, tweeted:
@thekiranbedi: Mid-day meals, at places r a scandal and un-hygienic.
Teachers too r wasting time cooking!Why not serve fruits and nuts?
Bedi's narrative corroborates with the above photographic evidence.
Not just Bihar, government run schools, across India, may have bigger stories of negligence and mismanagement to tell.
As far as this case is concerned, the Indian government was quick to announce a compensation of 2 lakhs (about 3,367 US dollars) to the victims family.
The exact cause of how the food became contaminated is being studied - in short, a long bureaucratic process follows.

The campaign symbol of president-elect Hassan Rouhani was a key.
Now, Iranian netizens are discussing whether Rouhani will actually be able to open any locks.
Rouhani promised a government of “hope and prudence”, and thousands of Iranians celebrated his victory hoping for a better future.
In Omid Dana's blog we read:
Which lock will Rouhani's key open?
Mostafa Tajzadeh says releasing political prisoners is not in the hands of Rouhani.
Doesn't Khatami say that we should lower our expectations?
People often say, with good reason, that the key to nuclear negotiations, relations with the US, and the Syria crisis are in the hands of the Supreme Leader... With all this said, Rouhani's only keys are those to his house or his office.
Jaleboon writes:
Some, like Omid Dana, ask which locks Rouhani can open.
The answer is that he already opened the lock of the election that had become illegitimate with the 2009 crisis.
Several netizens metion problems and locks that Rouhani's key might open.

Negar Mortazavi tweeted:
"Sources close to #Rouhani say he is planning to send special envoys to some countries to repair broken ties & start a new chapter with Tehran.
In the meantime several campaigns also asked Rouhani to fix the Iranian internet and end filtering.
A Facebook campaign asked Rouhani to end the filtering of Facebook, and a group of bloggers and cyber activists wrote a letter to the President-elect asking him to increase Internet speeds.
They also complain about filtering and remind Rouhani that he himself used the Internet to promote his campaign.
US President Barack Obama finished his six-day tour of three African countries, Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, on July 2, 2013.
The global public opinion about the importance and impact of his tour is sharply divided.
During his visit, Obama announced a new initiative, "Power Africa", to double access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Through this initiative, the US is committing seven billion US dollars while private sector companies have committed more than nine billion.
According to the White House blog, nearly 70 percent of Africans lack access to electricity.

Commenting about the initiative, Bright Simmons at African Argument commended this new idea for strategic engagement with Africa:
As one of the people who have in the past complained about the seeming lack of new ideas for a “strategic engagement with Africa” from the Obama White House, I welcome renewed energy towards that direction.
The issue selected – Africa’s electricity challenge – is clearly a vital one.
The World Bank for instance says that all sub-Saharan African countries, minus South Africa, combined do not generate more electricity than Argentina.
Including South Africa, they produce only as much as Spain.
It is commendable that the White House is pledging up to $7 billion in additional funding from two of its overseas-focussed agencies – EXIM and OPIC – for this cause.
I am sure that the White House is already aware that even if this whole amount was provided in a single year, and it is more likely that it will be provided over a 3 to 5 year timeframe, it will not be able to dent the $23 billion YEARLY deficit in energy investment on the continent.
Daniel McLaughling reacted to his post arguing that abolishing national monopolies on electrical utilities is the only solution capable of producing results:
If people are serious about solving Africa’s electricity problem, they should be promoting the only solution capable of producing real results: abolish national monopolies on electric utilities.
It amazes me that, with all of the talk about increasing electricity production, nobody wants to admit into the discussion the possibility that government monopolies and corruption are the problem, and that billions more in money transferred to governments will only entrench the corruption further, with little benefit for the people.
Open up the markets to competition and profits and you will see large-scale investments and significantly improved access.
Joel B. Pollak was of the view that "Power Africa" will likely not produce as much energy as promised:
"Power Africa" will likely not produce as much energy as promised, while lining the pockets of politically-connected individuals in both the U.S. and Africa.
Meanwhile, China, which does not mind if Africans are driving cars and living in large houses with air conditioning, will continue to invest in Africa in ways that generate actual economic growth, relegating the U.S. to the sidelines in Africa's economic future.
Siddhartha Mitter noted that "all infrastructure investment should be considered a good thing unless proven otherwise—especially in Africa":
At present, continent-wide installed capacity and power generation are roughly equivalent to those of Germany or Canada.
Remove South Africa and Egypt, and you are left with about 63 GW supplying 260 billion kWh, scarcely more than Australia or Iran.
In this context, if the first phase of Power Africa succeeds in its stated goal of adding 10 GW of generation capacity and connecting 20 million new residential and commercial customers, it will represent a major expansion—albeit not near the doubling of access that, according to the White House fact sheet on Power Africa, is the program’s ultimate aim.
Indeed, the same fact sheet soberly estimates that it would cost $300bn to secure universal access to power on the continent by 2030.
Despite the excitement shown by citizens of the three countries, Shadow Government showed that there was a low point to the trip:
But there has been a low point to the trip: namely, his comments in South Africa during the press conference with President Jacob Zuma.
The president made what I consider ill-thought-out comments, probably meant to be humorous, regarding the press.
He referred to the American press corps as "my press," and he chided them for asking too many questions.
Normally, perhaps, this wouldn't be a big deal.
But in that he was visiting three African countries whose press is judged by Freedom House to be "partially free," I think it is not just bad form but harmful for his administration's support for democracy.
Of course I would not expect the president to use his trip as an occasion to criticize his hosts directly.
But I would expect that while he, himself, is under scrutiny for his administration's treatment of the press (the AP phone records and Fox News's James Rosen), he would not make light of such matters.
Kumekucha called Obama "snubbish Obama" for not visiting Kenya, the land of his father:
Now that Obama has finally landed in Dar es Salaam dancing to Bongo 'Ohangla' Flava , we can finally bid him bye from without and mend our punctued national pride.
What a snubbish man to have him camp at next door neighbour with no regard to the hurt he is causing his own people who adore him so much.
SHAME.
Forget all the bitterness spewed that we do not need Obama's visit.
True, the economic side of such a visit would be realisedmuch later but boy, isn't Nairobi missing the buzz!
Obama's ICC-laced whip smacks of utmost contempt after Kibaki declared a holiday in his honour after winning the elections in 2008.
What is more, the Tanzanians could afford to shame him with a street name for recognition.
Looking at Obama's overall contribution to Africa's development, Tolu considered Obama "positively neglectful" when comparing him to the Bush administration.
He explained:
The Bush government left footprints across the continent beyond the aid arena.
It played a role in the signing of the peace agreement that brought an end to decades of civil war in Sudan, showed a lot of interest in bringing an end to the wars in the Congo region, and helped bring about an end to the civil war in Liberia, helping ensure Charles Taylor’s resignation, and eventual arrest and prosecution.
(Taylor has of course since wondered aloud why Bush is himself not facing prosecution for his own “crimes”).
Against this background of US, Obama comes across as positively neglectful.
His only activity of note has been to ramp up US military activity in Africa, adding drone bases and deploying significant numbers of troops.
When he was first elected there were celebrations across the continent, and perhaps unrealistic expectations that he would champion African interests on the world stage.
Indeed on his first visit to Ghana, he declared that he had “the blood of Africa within me”.
Since then his absence has been keenly felt, sparking accusations that he has betrayed his roots.
But is this fair?
Does Obama have a special responsibility to the continent, because of his ancestry?
Perhaps not.
Perhaps the emphasis on Obama as a black president is missing the point.
Because it’s not just for reasons of solidarity that the US president should attend to Africa.
There are more selfish reasons, both , economic and political, as well.
Being a feminist South African, Jennifer Thorpe noted that the environment she lives in affects women’s lives most tangibly.
She therefore looks at Obama's environmental protection track record:
We know the US has a poor track record environmentally — a perfect example of how legislation protecting the environment is not nearly as good as not polluting it in the first place.
Recently Obama has changed his tune, saying he’d stop dangerous and environmentally disastrous projects like the Keystone pipeline if they showed the environmental impact would be negative.
In South Africa, the Constitution provides the right for all of us to live in an environment that is not bad for our health.
Yet we see so often that environmental impact assessments just make sure that companies meet the bare minimum rather than actively going out of their way to protect the land and environment that belongs to all of us.
I hope that when President Obama evaluates the impact of Keystone on the environment, he does so in broad strokes, not in a narrowly defined minimum norms and standards type of way.
I think the question should be simple — will the innately valuable biodiversity, beauty, and sanctity of the land be improved by Keystone?
As someone who grew up in Hawaai, I know he knows the answer to this question in his heart.

@a_koen: Will all those displaced businesses and innocent civilians who were thrown in jail to clean up the city get their lives back? #ObamainAfrica
Brazil and Turkey are thousands of kilometers away from each other, but they have something in common: both countries went out to the streets to protest for their rights as citizens and are now struggling against the excessive violence and oppression from the police.
V for Vinegar is a website created to track protests and promote petitions about relevant causes in each country: in Brazil, for the demilitarization of the Police , and for the immediate end to the violence in Turkey .
Cambodian netizens are actively using Facebook to discuss, debate, and share updates about the July 28 National Assembly elections.
Meanwhile, political parties are also maximizing the popular social networking site to reach out to younger voters.
Moses Ngeth, an activist and human rights advocate, admitted his mistake about his earlier assertion that Cambodian Facebook users are only concerned with entertainment issues:
Several months ago I made an interview with media saying that young people (are only) using Facebook for entertainment and their own interest.
Since (the start of the) national election campaign, young people on Facebook have proven me wrong; and YES, I admit that I made a wrong comment.
I have seen the increasing number of young people who are using this social platform for change.
To all brave young people who are publicly standing up for their rights to choose their own leader, accept my apology

Rachna Im, a journalist for RFI in Khmer language and a young female blogger, agreed with Moses in a Facebook message reply sent to this author:
Facebook has been used in a brand new way.
Users, especially youth, have been recently using the social media as a platform of expressing their political views As I noticed, this is a good way to use this social media - to have one's voice heard and to also show a better situation in freedom of expression in Cambodia, not much, but at least a bit better.
However, Rachna reminded Cambodian netizens participating in political debates to respect diverse views:
They normally end up cursing others for having opposite ideas They believe they have freedom to support a party - but they don't respect others' freedom to support a different party.
I sometimes find myself hard to believe things posted on Facebook since I understand that that thing is probably posted by only the finger, not the brain.
Still, Rachna applauded young people for bravely expressing their thoughts and hoped that it would improve society especially the freedom of expression situation in Cambodia.
Chantra Be, a social networking manager of the Open Institute and a prominent organizer of BarCamp events in Cambodia who is known to dislike talking about politics, has recently initiated a political discussion.
In an interview with this author, Chantra explained his sudden interest in politics:
Personally I don't like politics, and I do not belong to any party.
I like to be in the middle.
I am a citizen who has the right to vote and share my thoughts.
I have read many things on Facebook that touch my heart about Cambodia's situation
Recently, Chantra questioned the role of 164 advisers of the ruling government and whether or not they have correctly advised the government on certain aspects such as health, education, judiciary, investment and the utilization of natural resource.
Sovichet Tep, a high school student and one of the country's youngest bloggers, also noticed the growing importance of social media in the country:
Information sharing has become viral not only during the start of the elections To my memory, this trend started since the mid or late 2011 when Facebook users began sharing information that are not accessible via the traditional media such as TV or radio. Although Sovichet is still young and could not yet vote, he believes that information sharing through the Internet can help him make an informed decision in the next election: Although I am too young to vote (But I can already vote in the next election), social media has clearly educated me about the current situation so that I could be well prepared to choose a party that I think and hope would prove to be good for our society.

Vola R of Ma-Laza reports that 7 were hurt following police repression of protests demanding elections in Antananarivo, Madagascar.
The party leading the protest states that the current administration has no intention of organizing elections this year and is just hanging on to their position of power.
The leader of the party was allegedly arrested following the protests.
Following three days of continuous protests, it seems the Heshan municipal government in Jiangmen city has abandoned its plans to construct a massive nuclear fuel complex.
Some believe that this victory - confirmed in a written document released on July 14, 2013 - is only temporary.
They worry the project may simply prop up somewhere else, near the highly populated Pear River Delta in Southern China.
The Heshan government made several concessions after hundreds of local residents took to the street on July 12 enraged by the high-risk project.
At first, the government tried to negotiate to extend their consultation period to 20 days.
But this move failed to pacify local residents and at a press conference on July 13 they announced, "with respect to public opinion, the project would not be approved" , even though the city government had already signed the initial agreement with China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC).
Protesters took to the street to oppose construction of the proposed nuclear fuel plant on July 12, 2013.
Image from Zhu Kunling's weibo.
But some people are not satisfied with the government's claim.
In the past, Chinese local governments have adopted delay-tactics like this to pacify people's anger.
For example, in Dalian, the city government suspended the PX factory after thousands took to the streets in 2011 in the "Not-In-My-Back-Yard" campaign, but the factory was restored back to normal operations after a few months .
"Little bee" (@小蜜蜂-V) and "Little Eaffen" (@Eaffen细细)'s comments on Sina Weibo:
"Little bee": Having seen the press conference, (the spokesperson) did not mention ‘cancel’, only said ‘as long as there is no agreement in the society, the project will not be approved and built.
(Have we) misunderstood?
Little Eaffen: Is it true?
What does it mean by ‘not approve’? We only accept ‘not to build the plant forever’!
Some netizens spelled out that the halt is just a ‘delay tactic’ :
Zhang Erfei flyfan: Wonder if which inland city will be unlucky.
Damn like motorcycle: Will (the government) announce that the Heshan nuclear processing plant is cancelled, and with research from professionals, the project will be relocated to Xinhui (another Guangdong city)?
The government document on the cancellation of the nuclear plant project .With anger and distrust, hundreds of local residents continued to rally on the third day on July 14 demanding a written official document on the cancellation of the project.
The city's two vice mayors arrived at the protest spot, Donghu Square to reassure the public of their decision.
Still people could not accept their verbal promise and they marched to the municipal government building, where the secretary of municipal Party committee showed them a written notice of the project's cancellation.
They cheered and claimed victory.
However, the written document has not cleared all skepticism as the contract signed between Heshan government and CNNC involves 37 billion RMB (6 billion USD) investment.
So far, the CNNC has not announced any change in its plan.
Some are worried that the project will eventually find a home in the Pearl River Delta.
For example, "ocean_Joe" said:
Ocean_Joe: We have to think carefully.
Why did the government introduce the project?
Why wasn't it introduced after public consultation?
Why did (the government) intend to make a decision that affects our lives and our offsprings' lives, in only 13 days?
The dispute has been settled, but who will know the project might start again in the future?
Please do not test the baseline of the people of Jiangmen and Pearl River Delta.
My home belongs to the Delta.
A mother and her two teenage daughters were shot to death after five masked men broke into their house in the small town of Chilas in Gilgit, Pakistan in what was reported to be an honor killing.
The girls, ages 15 and 16, were reportedly targeted on June 24, 2013 killing over a mobile video of them enjoying rain in their garden, which had been circulating locally and was taken as an affront to the family's honor.
Authorities allege that the killer was the girls' stepbrother Khutore who was enraged at watching this video and enlisted the help of four of his friends to restore, in his view, his family's honor.
The friends have since been captured and confessed to their crimes, but Khutore is still at large.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan's annual report, honor killings remain "the most consistent and abhorrent form of violence against women in Pakistan." In 2012, 913 women were killed in the name of their family's honor, including 99 children, the report says.
Shafiqul Hassan Siddiqui dissected the reasons behind honor killing in Pakistan on Dunya blogs:
It is an outcome of vengeance.
95% focused on women.
One of the family members (mostly a man), with the consent of other family members, kills and sentences the woman on few basis.
For the whole family this becomes a moment of pride when they sacrifice their own blood because due to her they earned dishonor.
There are many reasons that are considered as the main and basic causes behind the honor killing.
Reacting to the recent killing, New York Times Pakistan Bureau Chief Declan Walsh (@declanwalsh) tweeted:
@declanwalsh: utter madness - two girls and mother killed in northern Pakistan over video showing them enjoying the rain. http://beta.dawn.com/news/1020576
Lubna Khan (@Lubnagigyani), a blogger on gender issues, commented on the killings:
@Lubnagigyani: CRIME of the heinous kind.
Honourable humans do not KILL under any circumstances-egoistic machoism being the last
Political blogger Zeesh (@zeesh2) took issue with the term "honor killings":
@zeesh2: honor killing is a misnomer - misdirected emotions- if they really have honor they need to kill themselves not others

Gedrosia (@gedrosian), a Twitter user from Balochistan province, added that leaked mobile videos have had dire consequences for female students in conservative areas too:
@gedrosian: there are a number of cases in Balochistan too where college/school photos were leaked. and girls were taken out of colleges Writing a few days before this most recent killing, The Future summed up the solution to ending honor killings:
I feel that a revolution is required in the thinking pattern of the male members to change the existing notion of power. The prerequisite in the present scenario is not to empower one gender over the other but equilibrium between the two genders towards accomplishment of joint goals, better society and a better future for the upcoming generations by being proud of one’s own culture is needed.
The much anticipated face-off between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and protesters who called for the ousting of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi took place today .
The drama unfolded live on television, and was broadcast by local and international channels.
At least 17 people were killed and more than 400 protesters injured in clashes across Egypt today, which many on social media described as "expected" and "surreal."
Ayman Mohyeldin, Foreign Correspondent for NBC News based in Egypt, tweets:

Maspero is the Egyptian state television and radio building in midtown Cairo, and is a few metres away from Tahrir Square, where anti-Morsi protestors are continuing to celebrate Morsi's ouster.
And Andy Carvin notes:
@acarvin: Surreal footage on aje now - over a dozen guys throwing rocks, each lit up by a green laser to be target by opposing side
All this was inside Cairo alone.
Outside Cairo, clashes were also reported.
Mostafa Hussein writes:

Mohamed Fadel Fahmy adds:
@Repent11: A journalist in Suez just called me saying intense clashes between army and pro-Morsi protesters.
Gunshots and many injuries.
And Ahmed Mwaheb, from Ismailia, asks :
@AhmedMwaheb: Where is the army?
There is a street war in Ismailia and the Brotherhood have all sorts of weapons
The clashes, expected and feared by many, happen two days after Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate who became president a year ago, was ousted by the military following massive protests calling for his resignation and an end of the brotherhood's rule of Egypt.
Many point fingers at the military, the old regime and the Muslim Brotherhood for the clashes.
Philip Rizk notes:
@tabulagaza: Military/ old regime + brotherhood r to blame for the sick gun battles near tahrir.
The hatred increases on both sides w every shot fired
And Mohammed Maree concludes:
@mar3e: The Muslim Brotherhood will not have a future anymore.
The blood spilled will dissolve their brotherhood and they will be banished from political life
The clashes continue at the time of filing this post.
Four Egyptian adherents of the Shia faith were killed in Egypt today when the house they were meeting in was attacked by Salafists, following two weeks of instigation against the Shia.
According to various reports, the house the Shia were meeting in, in Giza, Cairo, was attacked and burned.
Al Badil News quotes a witness from the mortuary who says that one of those killed was slaughtered and the remaining three had injuries to their heads.
The horrific incident unleashed anger online.
Hazem Barakat documented the crime, sharing bloodied photographs and a video of the attack (Warning: Graphic video) online.
On Twitter, he says he was threatened for sharing the incident he has witnessed.
He adds :
@7azem122: I am ready to testify at the Public Prosecutor and I will say what happened in detail and I will say that the clergymen were the ones who instigated this crime
People gather at the alley in which the house where the Shia were killed in Cairo today.
Photograph shared on Twitter by @7azem122 He continues:
@7azem122: Instigating against the Shia started two weeks ago in all the mosques and today they executed their plan.
Those clergymen are sons of dogs.
They killed people with young children
Five hours ago he tweeted:
@7azem122: The Salafists have started to break the roof of the house the Shia are in.
It is a surreal scene.
Police remained idle as a home where Shia Egyptians were meeting today was attacked by Salafists, says Hazem Barakat (@7azem122)
He also claims the police, including officers, were standing by and watching as the lynching took place.
The incident was met with anger online.
Satirist Dr Bassem Youssef tweets:
@DrBassemYoussef: Today it is a Shia; tomorrow a Sufi, and then a Copt, a before him a Bahai.
Afterwards it will be a Muslim who doesn't agree with the way you want to implement Sharia (Islamic teachings) with your ideology and then it will be someone whose look you don't like
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia shares a similar thought:
@Zeinobia: And today it is the Shia and tomorrow your neighbour who is not in agreement with you politically and intellectually
Ahmed Abou Hussein asks:
@abouhussein7: When your clergyman says that the protestors are infidels and that the Shia are unchaste, don't be surprised when they are killed.
Morsi, the question is not whether you have lost your legitimacy.
The question is: how many times have you lost your legitimacy?
Ahmad Khalil is surprised at the way people are reasoning murder:
@ahmad_khalil: The Salafists have killed four Shia.
What is surprising is that there are some among those who are condemning the act who say that spilling the blood of a Muslim is Haram .
It is as if spilling the blood of a Christian is Halal (acceptable in Islam].
Such sectarian ideas have inflicted everyone.
Sherif Azer notes :
@sherif_azer: There were a lot of incidents and statements that have happened over the past period which prepared the scene for the attack on the Shia in Egypt.
Not being prepared for such an incident is a crime in its own
And Adel Salib wonders why people are shocked that the Shia are being attacked in Egypt when the police previously attacked - and killed - Egyptian Copts:
@Adel_Salib: Someone is surprised that the police were watching while the Shia were being murdered when two months ago the police were attacking the Cathedral.
Are you under a spell or just stupid?

Rawah Badrawi shares some history:
@RawahBadrawi: Cairo was founded by Shias you Neanderthals.
They established half its heritage sites including Al Azhar.
And Yemeni blogger Noon Arabia concludes:
@NoonArabia: We are returning to the age of Jahiliyya .
Islam is innocent of the blood being spilled today in Egypt, Lebanon and Syria
Of course not everyone was horrified by the attack.

This post is a part of our Special Coverage Egyptians Overthrow Morsi
The US meddling in Egyptian affairs - and the coverage of news networks, particularly CNN, of the political developments in Egypt - came under fire last night.
The ousting of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi after a year in office ushered celebrations across the country, as well as a bout of violence between pro- and anti-Morsi supporters.
While Morsi supporters say that the removal of Morsi from power was a military coup, the anti-Morsi camp insists it was the will of the people, with the support of the powerful military establishment that has made the ousting possible.
Many also are angry over what they call as the US meddling in Egyptian Affairs.
They say that the "provocative statement" by US president Barak Obama ignored the masses who took the streets to reclaim their freedom and waved the aid card instead.
The US statement, issued on July 3, reads:
The United States is monitoring the very fluid situation in Egypt, and we believe that ultimately the future of Egypt can only be determined by the Egyptian people.
Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned by the decision of the Egyptian Armed Forces to remove President Morsy and suspend the Egyptian constitution.
I now call on the Egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process, and to avoid any arbitrary arrests of President Morsy and his supporters.
Given today’s developments, I have also directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under U.S. law for our assistance to the Government of Egypt.
Following this reaction, CNN, which was covering the developments live, started what many netizens call "a vapid campaign to support the ousted Muslim Brotherhood President and his legitimacy by describing the pro-Morsi rallies as "peaceful", calling the popular demand a "coup" and denouncing the military action against the "peaceful" MB protestors:

On the CNN network's objectivity while airing the clashes instigated by MB supporters, May Kamel highlighted:
@MayKamel Now that #MBareterrorists are attacking people in #Tahrir with live ammo, CNN Live is not interested to air. #CNN_STOP_Lying_About_Egypt
Waleed Says:
@WilloEgy 33 million civilians in the streets urging #Morsi to step down and you still call it military coup?
You are deliberately twisting facts.
While Ahmed Sabry said:

@Baheyah: #EgyptianRevolutionNotMilitaryCoup egyptians went out to get rid of #morsi using their weapon of mass distraction = their VOICE
In her post, entitled June 30: The Real Deal, Yusra Badr says the Muslim Brotherhood's one-year rule has deprived the Egyptian Nation of its long awaited celebrations and turned them into funerals.
She adds:
I am not a political activist, I am not a reporter and I am not an expert analyst, but I am one of the millions of Egyptians who wanted Morsi out of their presidential palace.
I am also one of the millions whose hearts are breaking at being deprived of the victory we achieved on June 30th by having the truth distorted and confusing the world into looking down at us.
She then concludes:
So here you have it, in very simple words, perhaps even naive, because I am writing this in the middle of the night and did not use any references.
But references are unnecessary for me because I have been living in this nightmare for a year, and I am proud of what we have done on June 30 and of the support of our military.
That’s it; the real deal.
This is not a coup, this is the will of the nation coming to life in an unconventional manner
This post is a part of our Special Coverage Egyptians Overthrow Morsi
Blogger and video journalist Menna Alaa was attacked by angry pro-Morsi supporters today.
She shares her testimony, in English, in this post on Egyptian Chronicles.
She writes:

President Obama is currently touring Africa on a visit scheduled from June 26 to July 3, 2013.
He was recently in South Africa after having visited Senegal and Tanzania next after South Africa.
Many commentators see this trip as a catch-up mission, as an attempt by the United States to respond to the Chinese economic breakthrough in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Since 2010, China has been the leading commercial partner in Africa , although four years ago, at the time of Obama’s visit to Ghana, the US were in this position.
Obama’s speech in Ghana four years ago left many Africans sceptical and there seemed to be little common ground.
In the video below, Global Voices contributor Abel Asrat for Global Voices in Ahmaric gave his point of view on Obama's policy in Africa as of today:
On Twitter, doubts over the reasons for Obama’s visit to Africa were reflected by use of hashtag Wolof #ObamaTakh which translates just well as “Because of Obama” as “Thanks to Obama” - appeared several days before his arrival in Dakar.
Since his arrival on Senegalese soil "because of Obama" seems to be the most prominent use of the word that took over the social networks.
Then the mood changed, as @LebouPrincess, a Senegalese based in DC, underlined on Twitter: The questions from the 300 journalists were screened beforehand.
Macky Sall’s response did not disappoint Senegalese traditionalists : For much of the 1980s, the United Kingdom and United States were perceived by some South Africans, not wholly without reason, as tolerating the apartheid government.
That may help explain why some of Obama’s critics in South Africa criticize him for supporting the “apartheid state” of Israel.
The groups also cite U.S. drone strikes and the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Five minutes before the end of a game between the football teams Real Garcilaso and Sporting Cristal, 18-year-old Sporting Cristal player Yair José Clavijo suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away.
Sporting Cristal's medical team tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him at the field of the Municipal Stadium in Urcos, in Cusco.
Former football commentator Elejalder Godos joined the Twitter users who resorted to the microblogging network to express their feelings about this sad news:
My condolences to Yair Clavijo's family for the untimely passing of young Sporting Cristal player in a Cusquean field.
Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood senior member, is no longer the president of Egypt.
Head of the Egyptian Armed Forces General Abdel Fattah Al Sisi said in an announcement broadcast live minutes ago that the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court will be the new interim president and that a technocrat national government will be formed.
Many are happy to see the end of the Muslim Brotherhood's days at the helm of Egyptian politics.

President Mohamed Morsi is no longer the president of Egypt.
Instead, he is ranting on Twitter on his verified Twitter account @EgyPresidency.
Morsi's one-year reign was cut short, after massive protests across Egypt calling for him to resign started on June 30.
Head of the Egyptian Armed Forces General Abdel Fattah Al Sisi said in an announcement broadcast live minutes ago that the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court Adly Mansour will be the new interim president and that a technocrat national government will be formed.
Al Sisi also announced that the Egyptian constitution has been suspended and that preparations will be made for both presidential and parliamentary elections.
In a series of tweets, in English, Morsi described the action taken by the Army represents a full coup:
@EgyPresidency: Pres. Morsy: Measures announced by Armed Forces leadership represent a full coup categorically rejected by all the free men of our nation
He adds:
@EgyPresidency: Pres. Morsy: Armed Forces announcement is rejected by all free men who struggled for a civil democratic Egypt.
And notes:
@EgyPresidency: Pres. Morsy urges civilians and military members to uphold the law & the Constitution not to accept that coup which turns #Egypt backwards
Morsi also calls for avoiding bloodshed:
@EgyPresidency: Pres. Morsy urges everyone to adhere to peacefulness and avoid shedding blood of fellow countrymen.
Families of Saudi detainees marked the Third Detainees Day to protest the arbitrary detention of their loved ones, who have been behind bars for years without access to a fair trial.
The day, on July 7, was called for by anonymous advocacy groups @e3teqal and @almonaseron .
Saudi Arabia is one of the few remaining absolute monarchies in the world and has a devastating human rights record which includes arbitrarily detaining over 30,000 people.
Across the kingdom, families of detainees hung pictures and signs demanding the release of their relatives.
They made videos and distributed flyers to publicize the cause.
Unlike the first and second detainees day, this time bridges were guarded by security forces to make sure no one hangs signs on them.
Also, walls that had any sort of expressions demanding the release of the prisoners were painted right away.
The family that got the most attention was that of Abdullah Al-Ayaf.
Al-Ayaf has been in jail for six years now.
He was tried and acquitted, but he still remains in jail.
His picture was hung outside their home in Qassim.
The house was soon surrounded by police and Mabahith (secret police) cars.
A member of the Mabahith talked to Maha Al-Dhuhaian - Al-Ayaf's wife - during the day and cursed her.
Later, a police officer came to talk to her demanding the photograph be taken down. She told him about the Mabahith member.
"I don't think any member of the security forces would say those things," the officer replies.
"That sign is the only reason we're here in the first place, it's better you take it down," he adds.
"The sign means I want my husband back. Don't send me your thugs.
The sign is staying," she tells him.
The conversation was being videotaped by Yasser, Al-Dhuhaian and Al-Ayaf's son.
The officer asks him if he is shooting and Yasser answers "Yes, I am."
The officer makes an immediate phone call while the mother tells him "are you calling about my son?
Don't.
I told him to shoot this."
As soon as the video was uploaded to YouTube, it went viral.
Saudi tweeps started a hashtag demanding that Mabahith member be held accountable for slander.
At dawn, police officers threatened Saleh,Yasser's brother, saying they would crash his cars if he doesn't give them Yasser's ID.
Maha Al-Dhuhaian tweeted:
People are performing dawn prayers while police are at my door demanding I hand in my sons or they will crash our car.
What security are they talking about?
The next day, July 8, police came to surround the house again demanding the family hands in the son who shot the video.
At the same time, an employee from the ministry of interior called the family asking them to delete the video and promising they will get what the want.
The last time I spoke to Yasser, he told me: "My father will be released sooner or later.

Today, the Egyptian army named a new interim president, suspended the constitution and promised new presidential and parliamentary elections will be held soon.
This video, and the timing of his release which coincided with reports that Morsi was under house arrest, has made many confused.

Journalist Jenan Moussa first shared the video link on Twitter and then removed it.
She explains:
@jenanmoussa: I am deleting the video of alleged arrest of Morsi.
Not confirmed at all.
Apologies.
And Egyptocracy tweets:
@Egyptocracy: There is an false video circulating now of alleged "#Morsi arrest", he was never arrested, he was under republican guard protection. #Egypt
Meanwhile, Cairo-based Egyptian journalist Amira Howeidy notes:

More than 60 Vietnamese bloggers signed a unity statement urging the Vietnam government to improve its human rights record and commitment as it vies for membership in the UN Human Rights Council:
The Vietnamese government also needs to review the human rights situation in their own country and the Vietnamese people also have a right to freedom of opinion and expression, including on these matters.
As advocates for freedom of expression in Vietnam and victims of human rights violations because of our activism, we view Vietnam's candidacy for the Human Rights Council as a platform for constructive human rights discussions in our country.
Global hacktivist group Anonymous has leaked the 1990-2011 financial accounts of the governing Partido Popular (PP) to the Internet. Recently, the judge overseeing the Gürtel case, an ongoing political corruption scandal in Spain that implicates PP members, asked for access to the documents dated since 1990 on the suspicion of illegal financing.
The PP refused, claiming that they were only obligated turn in documents from the last five years.
On 8 July, 2013, Anonymous uploaded close to 5GB of data of the party's accounts, and at the same time made their financial data since 1990 public on portal anonyourvoice.com. The content rapidly spread via social networks, torrents, blogs and channels.
This data, which was not public before, has now become available to the citizenry. Thousands of citizens through social networks have started to share and scrutinize the documents.
You can follow the examination of these documents on Twitter under the hashtag #CuentasdelPP :

‏@alvarinaitis : #CuentasDelPP But seriously, Is no one going to show their face today? a statement? nobody from the @PPopular nor business sponsors?
The PP, which promised to submit a transparency law before the first 100 days of government but has still not formalised the legislation, has been exposed through the broadcasting of its financial management to the watchful eyes of hundreds of anonymous people.
Public management is being examined.
Several hundred residents in Jiangmen, a city near China’s southern Guangzhou, took to the street to protest against a planned uranium processing plant on July 12, 2013.
Marchers moved through the city carrying banners and wearing masks that read “we want children, not atoms.”
The protesters say they're worried about radiation and possible nuclear pollution.
According to The New York Times, Jiangmen authorities have already signed an agreement with the China National Nuclear Corporation to house the six billion US dollar project.
Construction is expected to begin at the end of this year.
The local government announced the project last week, giving the public 10 days to submit comments.
The officials claimed that the plant is harmless, but the residents were not convinced.
A news conference was held after the protest, and the mayor promised to extend another 10 days for public comment.
Earlier this year, similar protest took place in China’s southern Kunming where residents protested against a gas refinery.
South China Morning Post has reported that the protest had been organized via China’s social messaging services: QQ and WeChat.
On China’s most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, information about the protests was quickly censored.
Some Weibo users were able to get around the censor and post pictures.
Below are some of the pictures of the protests from Sina Weibo:
Banner reads: We want children, not atoms. (from Sina Weibo)
At least three women were killed in Mansoura when a protest in support of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was attacked by "thugs" tonight.
Dozens of people were also reportedly injured by shotgun and knife wounds.
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia exclaims:
And @egyrevolution12 adds :
The Ikhwan protests in Mansoura start after prayers and half of it is usually women.
Complete families/ Attacking them cannot be excused.
Ibrahim Elgarhi is shocked at those who excuse the murder of women.
He writes:
Let's sell our values and keep quiet over the murder of women.
Let's go against our conscience and say what took them (the women) there (to the protest).
On June 30, Egyptians took to the streets to demand that president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood (MB) candidate, steps down.
On July 3, Morsi's one-year reign was cut short and an interim government now runs Egypt.
Morsi's supporters have since been staging protests calling for his return to power.
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital, is getting back to normal after two days in which the city found itself playing host to arguably the most powerful man on earth: President Barack Obama of the United States.
The city's streets were inundated with posters of the man.

This instagrammer captured an image on one of the billboards and seemed quite pleased about the prospect of Obama's visit:
Folks lined up the streets to welcome the first African-American president to their shores, as the image posted with the tweet below demonstrates:
@whitehouse: "Ultimately, the goal here is for Africa to build Africa for Africans." —Obama in Tanzania: http://at.wh.gov/mz2hT , pic.twitter.com/pnBCU7bSCQ
And upon landing, Obama received an especially warm reception, as photo-blogger Issa Michuzi was able to capture in this photograph the mood at Julius Nyerere International Airport:
President Obama arriving at Julius Nyerere International Airport.

Such images prompted one tweep to say this:
@bkyeyune: By the looks of the online images/photos, Obama had more fun in Tanzania than he had in South Africa.
The interest in Obama's visit extended farther than the streets of Dar es Salaam.
Gaure Mdee (@Profesy) tweeted this image from Stone Town, Zanzibar showing people watching his visit on local television:
Zanzibaris watching Obama's visit on local television station.
Photo courtesy of @Profesy.
This view seemed to be shared by blogger Elsie Eyakuze of The Mikocheni Report who, a week ago, conjured up the word 'neocolonialism' in describing the relevance of Mr. Obama's visit:
Now there's going to be a delegation of hundreds of businessmen in the Obama entourage looking to explore opportunities in Tanzania.
There is something disconcerting about being considered a sweet little morsel by America on the planet...Gas, Africom, the Millenium Challenge Corporation, businessmen - what are these in the face of our current situation?
Yes, Barack Obama is coming to Tanzania.
If he could bring along plane-load of respect for civil rights and inject it directly into my government's veins I would be happier.
But I understand POTUS has a few problems of his own respecting the freedoms of Americans- like, say, freedom from state surveillance? *shrug.*
Over at Vijana.FM, there were complaints about why there was more brouhaha for this Head of State than usually afforded to other visiting Presidents:
I can understand the vast security preparations for him, but should we only clean up when we have a high profile guest?
I understand that he comes to visit our country and maybe he has good things in store, but our reaction to his visit is absurd.
What message are we sending to our fellow African states, and most importantly, to the world?
What message are we passing along to the young generation, the leaders in the making?
Elsewhere, January Makamba, who also happens to be the Deputy Minister for Science and Technology, blogging at Taifa Letu, argued that it is not Tanzania, and in extension Africa, that needs the US.
Rather, it was America that needed Africa more:
America’s global leadership remains robust – at least for now.
One way to retain and strengthen it in the face of insecure world and a deepening economic and cultural competition is to project it for the good of humanity.
And this is the expectation of most Africans – that America shouldn’t befriend a country just for security or strategic concerns but because of advancement of shared values – of freedom, equality, tolerance and human progress.
As Obama departed, Ahmed Salim (@asalim86) captured what the country felt yesterday evening:
@asalim86: …and POTUS is gone, back to our regularly scheduled program in #Tanzania
And while the significance of his visit continues to be a point of contention, it seems like Mr. Obama is already entrenching his legacy into Dar es Salaam's identity:

David Degner shares photographs from the mobbed and burned churches in Mallawi, Minya, in Upper Egypt here.
He writes:
Friday two churches in the village of Mallawi, a village in the province of Minya, were attacked and set on fire.
After the attack on the pro-Morsy sit in where more than 600 people died, Morsy supporters gathered after Friday prayer storming and burning two churches, and some Christian owned shops in the village of Mallawi.
Groups also attacked and looted the museum of Mallawi, and banks, shops and 10 other churches in Minya.
He shares this video, showing the Evangelical Church, in Mallawi, burning:
A fight broke out in a Riyadh mosque between Saudis and Egyptians after a Saudi clergyman cursed Egyptian Defence Minister General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during today's Friday prayers sermon.
The fight, uploaded on to YouTube, has gone viral and the tug-of-words continues online.
The 46-second video, uploaded on several accounts on YouTube, has been the talk of the Saudi blogosphere today.
One version, uploaded today by umum0707, has been watched more than 750,000 times at the time of writing this post.
It shows a man in Saudi garb taking off his headgear, the agal, and hitting another man, an Egyptian, inside Al Ferdous Mosque, after the latter objected to el-Sisi being cursed.
A commotion follows:
el-Sisi, who is also the First Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt now, played a leading role in the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member.
Mohamed Al Omar posts a link to the video on Twitter and quips :
This fight is proof of the chaos that will happen if squabbles on Twitter are taken to the street
Ibrahim Al Rasheed said the preacher had no business butting into Egyptian affairs:
The people of Egypt are more knowledgeable of their affairs and it is of bad taste for this preacher to employ himself as a guardian over Egyptians
Others provide suggestions of how to deal with such clergymen in the future.
Yazeed Al-Mogren writes:
Next time, those praying should break the preacher's jaw so that he learns his lesson and stops including his political opinion in sermons
They say the clergyman has been arrested.
What about the cattle who disrupted the sanctity of the mosque and hit the Egyptians there?
When will they be arrested and put on trial?
Activist Waleed Sulais sees no reason for aggressive behaviour.
No to violence.
Political differences should be peaceful, and resorting to violence and excusing it, by any side, is unacceptable
He adds:
Cursing others is unacceptable and beating up whoever objects to that is vile.
People have dignity.

Egyptian women rights advocate Dalia Aziada posted this tweet after several Coptic churches were burnt across Egypt following a brutal military operation on August 14 2013, to clear Muslim Brotherhood supporters from sit-in camps in the capital Cairo, where they have been demanding ousted president Morsi's reinstatement for weeks.
The clearing operation resulted in at least 638 deaths according to the Egyptian government.
A Muslim Brotherhood spokesman has said 2,000 people were killed in the “massacre.”
Dozens more were killed on August 16, as Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with security forces in the "Day of Anger."

President Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's presidential election on Saturday 31 July, 2013, beating his closest rival, the former Prime Minister in the coalition government Morgan Tsvangirai.
The peaceful elections were the first since the formation of a coalition government between Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Tsvangirai's The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
The coalition was formed following the last disputed and bloody elections in 2008.
Mugabe, who is 89 years old and has been in power for 33 years, will continue to rule the country for the next five years.
Election observer missions from the African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) have endorsed Mugabe's victory amid claims of massive electoral fraud coming from the opposition.
Botswana, however, is the only African country that has called for an independent audit into the election.
Some SADCC members have qualified their endorsements by arguing that the election was free "but not necessarily fair."
President Robert Mugabe is the oldest leader in Africa.
Photo released to the public domain by the U.S. federal government.
The election took place despite protests from Mugabe's coalition partners and Zimbabwean citizens after he unilaterally declared 31 July, 2013 as the date the country will hold elections.
The Constitutional Court ordered Robert Mugabe to hold elections by 31 July following a successful application by Jealousy Mawarire, director of the Centre for Elections and Democracy in Southern Africa (CEDSA).
Using the hashtags #ZimElections, #ZimbabweDecides, #ZimDecides and #ZimbabweElections, Twitter users from different parts of the world react to Mugabe's victory.
A Zambian based in the the UK and the founder of CrossFire Radio, Mueti Moomba (@Muweight) wondered who voted for the 89-year-old leader:

South African author and brand advisor Thebe Ikafaleng (@ThebeIkafaleng) quoted Tendai Biti, the Secretary General for MDC, making fun of those arguing that the presence of two million dead people on the voters' roll did not cost the opposition:
"They admit there's 2m people who are dead on the voters' roll, but 'because they're dead, they can't vote'."
Tendai Biti. #ZimbabweDecides. — Thebe Ikalafeng (@ThebeIkalafeng) July 31, 2013

Saudi Arabia marks its National Day on September 23.
While this is usually a day people celebrate the monarchy more than the country itself, the previous two national days were different.
Saudis, with the use of social networks and blogs, had the chance to express themselves freely - blogging their hopes for a nation which respects and embraces its people and their aspirations.
Writer and Doctor, Bader Al-Ibrahim wrote:
The carnival celebration is not enough to reinforce the national sense of belonging in the absence of a popular memory, a joint identity and institutions sponsoring citizenship.
Jordanian Human Rights Defender, Fadi Al-Qadi, tweeted:
Abdullah Al-Hamed and his fellows in ACPRA are spending the Saudi national day in prisons.
One of their charges is "impeding development" while the ruler's charge is "impeding humanity".
Writer Abdullah Al-Malki tweeted:
On our national day, we remember ACPRA, Al-Hamed, Al-Qahtani, Al-Bjadi, Tawfeeq Al-Amer, Al-Mnasif and Jeddah reformists and everyone who struggled for this country to reform and prosper.
Peace be upon you.
While Eman Al-Qaffas noted:
Whoever thinks loving your country necessitates loving your government is a person who does not love the country.
And Rehab Al-Hamdan added:
People are more aware now.
Empty words don't fool them anymore.
Many bloggers shared their thoughts on the national day from different perspectives.
Sultan Al-Amer, writer and blogger, wrote from an Arab nationalist point of view:
Our national history as Arabs is not restricted by the borders and history of Saudi Arabia.
Our national history is that of the people living between the Gulf and the ocean not the history of regimes only.
The meaning of "a country" cannot be celebrated until it is embodied by political rights and freedoms.
The ruling regimes can easily build a strong legitimacy if they start defending and siding with their people's causes and responding to their hopes and aspirations.
While another nationalist journalist and writer, Abdullah Al-Duhailan, blogged criticizing two types of people.
One is the intellectual elites who refuse to celebrate such a day until all political and civil demands are met.
The other is the majority of the people who respond to media's propaganda and celebrate certain people instead of the country itself.
The families of detainees saw this day as a chance to raise awareness about their cause.
Anonymous advocacy groups @e3teqal and @almonaseron called for several small protests that took place mainly in Buraiydah.
From the women's protest in Buraiydah
Tires were burnt in non-residential areas with posters next to them demanding the release of the detainees.
And a meeting was held in Buraiydah where relatives of detainees met and discussed the possible ways to support the detainees.
The family of Abdulkarim Al-Khuder, imprisoned ACPRA member, were among a few families who had their houses surrounded by police cars for hanging pictures of their detained loved ones.
Mahdi Al-Zahir, an activist from Qatif, tweeted:
I would like to celebrate the national day.
But my brother is detained, my cousin is detained, my friend is detained, even my neighbor is detained.
And The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) published a statement calling for the release of all prisoners of conscience and for a national dialogue between the government and elected representatives of the people as equals.
There are persons in this nation, like any other, who are willing to continue the peaceful struggle until their legitimate demands are met.
Prisons will not be enough.
Every time a group is imprisoned, another group will come out... Governments, and sometimes countries, change, but the people remain.
Honorable Joseph (Sugu) Mbilinyi resisting attempts by security officers to remove him from Parliament last week.

Over the last few years, Tanzania's parliament has become fodder for fantastic theatrics.
Random eruptions of arguments followed by mass walkouts, usually by the opposition, has turned parliamentary sessions into must-watch television.
In April 2011, for example, Ezekiel Wenje, a member of parliament (MP) from the leading opposition party Chadema, drew the ire of the Speaker Anna Makinda with his comment that certain government positions are selected via the 'dark market'.
Ruling party MPs from Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) protested and demanded that Wenje retract his statement.
He refused, upon which a shouting match broke out.
As Tanzanian blogger Subi wrote at the time, heard within this exchange was the phrase, "tufunge mlango tupigane" ("let's close the doors and fight").
In the end it never came to that, as Wenje took back his statement, and things proceeded with relative calm.
But there were a few other close calls.
In February 2013, live coverage of a session had to be suspended because things became too heated.
And then there was the incident five months ago, when a Chadema MP was thrown out of the chamber for interrupting a colleague of his from CCM, during a debate on the budget.
Serukamba's 'f**k you' moment prompted one commenter, a voter from his constituency, identifying himself as Dr Mvano Khalidi, to apologize on Facebook for his MP's conduct:
My apologies honorable members of parliament for the insult thrown at you, we ask your forgiveness on behalf of everyone from Kigoma, for the error committed by our MP from Kigoma his tongue slipped and he did not intended to say what he said, I am a patriot for my region.
On Thursday, 5 September, 2013, matters got even farther out of hand.
An opposition MP Joseph Mbilinyi of Chadema found himself embroiled in a physical altercation with parliamentary security officers that surprised and shocked in equal measure.
Things came to a head after Freeman Mbowe, the leader of the opposition in parliament, refused to sit down after being asked to do so by Ndugai.
From newspaper The Citizen:
Mr Ndugai ordered that the Chadema supremo be kicked out for disregarding his orders to sit down.
Mr Mbowe was protesting the move by the Deputy Speaker to bar him from moving a motion to block continuation of the debate on the Bill for Amendment of the Constitutional Review Act 2013.
Chaos soon ensued on the floor as other opposition MPs rushed to form a human shield around Mr Mbowe to prevent the security men from throwing him out.
On the popular platform Jamii Forums, photos showing Mbilinyi resisting attempts by officers to remove him from the House floor generated considerable debate about the nature of politics in Tanzania.
One commenter by the name of "Stoudemire" posed this question:
With this attitude, should we give the country to young people?
Our elders are good enough even if they doze off in Parliament!
Another contributor by the name of Tata suggested that the whole incident pointed to the inability by Deputy Speaker Ndugai to control the session.
Tata also implied that the behaviour by MP Mbilinyi may have been because he was under the influence:
The Deputy Speaker makes me laugh when he suggests that it is shameful for the leader of the opposition to instruct other opposition members to leave the chamber, when in fact it is a shame for him to be unable to control the session. But this move by Honorable Sugu has left me dead with laughter.
It seems like he was drunk on something or may have smoked these cigarettes preferred by the youth.
On Twitter, Sajjad Fazel (@SajjadF) argued that the incident may have undermined Chadema's credibility: What Hon. Joseph Mbilinyi has done gives a really negative image of Chadema and Tanzanians as a whole.
The former Attorney General, former Minister of Infrastructure, currently beleaguered owner of a few billion 'vijisenti' . Mr. Andrew Chenge was caught on CCTV a few nights ago doing something very fishy inside Parliament.
Mheshimiwa was filmed entering the building after hours in the company of a Parliament staff member, and sprinkling an unknown substance on every all the MPs' seats.
He spent an especially long time hovering around the Speaker's chair.
I am guessing it was not linen freshening spray.
At the time, Chenge was under investigation by the British government's Serious Fraud Office for corruption involving the British arms manufacturer BAE.
Four years later, after Tanzania's Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau 'failed' to discover evidence of wrongdoing, the Director of Public Prosecution dropped the charges.
That day in parliament, however, it was unclear what, exactly, Chenge was doing.
But for Ms. Eyakuze it seemed that the former Attorney General had resorted to the dark arts to get himself out of trouble:
Your goat, Mr. Chenge, is roasted.
Your chickens have come home and they are roosting.
You are reaping what you sowed, et cetera. What you have left in the public eye at this point is a tiny little modicum of dignity, that stuff that we so willingly accord to old men with money and pot-bellies.
I suggest you hold on to it with both hands.
Sneaking around ju-juing your fellow MPs isn't the way to do it.
Chenge is still in parliament and currently serves as the Chairman of the powerful Parliamentary Budget Committee.

GV Face: Retweeting Terrorists?
Social media played a major role in the dissemination of news about the terrorist attack on Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, but unverified information spread with lightning speed, including from government, terrorists, journalists and citizens on Facebook and Twitter.
What does this tell us about the quest for truth in the aftermath of this devastating attack on Kenyan citizens?
Does it even matter what the media report, when anyone who wants the real story seeks out hashtags on Twitter?
GV's Sub-Saharan Africa authors - Omar Mohamad (@shurufu ) and Collins Mbalo (@collinsom92) answered these questions and more in our Google Hangout series GV Face on Friday, September 27, 2013.
How different is reporting on the Syrian crisis depending on where you are?
And what does that mean for Syrians?
We discussed this and more in a Google Hangout on Monday, Sep 23, 2013, at 11am EST/3pm UTC in our second edition of GV Face.
Reports in the US or UK suggest that chemical weapons were used by President Assad's regime to kill more than a thousand people in Syria last month.
Meanwhile, Russian reporters say "all is well" in Damascus.
And Iranian media reports the chemical attack was by "rebels" trying to raise the pressure for an international intervention.
As the US government weighs military action in Syria, Russia's President Putin appealed to the American people in the New York Times to keep their weapons out of the war-torn country.
Videos suggesting Iranian military activity on the ground in Syria have gone viral on social media.
Our Hangout participants included GV Syria author, Leila Nachawati, Founder of Syria Untold, an online storytelling project dedicated to the non-violent Syrian uprising; our RuNet Echo editor Kevin Rothrock who spoke about the Putin and Mc Cain OpEds and how they were perceived by the Russian Internet; Amira Al Hussaini, our MENA Editor, touched on citizen media and mainstream media coverage of Syria within the Middle East and North Africa; Solana Larsen, our Managing Editor spoke about the role of citizen media in mainstream portrayal of Syria, Ellery Biddle our Advocacy Editor spoke about how the calls for US intervention are being interpreted by US netizens, and Ivan Sigal our Executive Director gave his opinion on why Syrian coverage is being shaped the way it is around the world.

Public display of affection is widely frowned upon in Egypt, as laws of public indecency could be used to prosecute those who publicly show affection or drink alcohol on the streets.
Alongside the photo, ElGohary shared lyrics of Youssra El Hawary's song On The Street.
El Hawary an upcoming independent singer and her songs proved a youtube success.
On The Street's lyrics read:
Some people curse each other, kill each other on the street,
Some people sleep on the floor on the street,
Some people sell their honor on the street,
But it would truly be a scandal if one day we forgot and kissed each other on the street!
Rocky Intan explains why a minimum wage hike in Indonesia will harm the country's economy:
National and local leaders should resist pressure by some union leaders for an increase in the minimum wage.
The increase has not been in line with inflation, unlike what the protesters claim.
Moreover, the raise will result in further worker layoffs and damage our regional competitiveness in labor-intensive manufacturing.

At the time of writing, the number of people killed in the brutal attack on Westgate Mall in Nairobi stood at 69, with more than 200 injured.
Armed militants burst into the mall, one of the city's most popular locations for foreigners and middle-class Kenyans, and carried out the deadliest attack the country has seen since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy.
Among the dead include renowned Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor.
Also killed was a well-known broadcaster, Ruhila Adatia.
She was reportedly pregnant.
I, too, lost friends in the Westgate attack: Ross Langdon and Elif Yavuz, a couple who were expecting their first child.
They lived in Dar es Salaam but were in Nairobi to have their baby there because they preferred the city's medical care.
Elif had completed her PhD at the Harvard University's School of Public Health.
She moved to Dar es Salaam to work for the Clinton Foundation.
Here she is, meeting with President Bill Clinton during his visit to Tanzania in August:

Elif was smart, witty, disarmingly charming and a joy to be around.
She would have made a terrific mother.
Her boyfriend Ross had the easy going Aussie humor and zest for life typical of folks from 'down under.'
He was also an incredibly talented architect.
He co-founded a successful inter-continental design studio, Regional Associates.
Here he is talking about what he called Chameleon architecture at last year's TEDxKraków:
He was looking forward to becoming a Dad.
But Ross and Elif are now gone.
It is difficult to explain why these two wonderful human beings and Professor Awoonor and Ms. Adatia, and Mbugua and Wahito and all the other innocent souls who perished at Westgate Mall had to die.
In the words of the writer Teju Cole (@tejucole), may their gentle souls be ferried in peace to the new world.

In a moment, everything changed.
On 21 September, 2013, a group of armed militants stormed an upscale mall in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, and opened fire, killing by the latest count 69 people and injuring hundreds more.
Twitter captured the confusion of the attack in real-time as users first reported what they thought was an explosion.
Shortly after noon, news started trickling through the social network that something had gone horribly wrong at Westgate Mall, one of Nairobi's most popular locations for foreigners and middle-class Kenyans.
Ma Bradley (@NyamburaMumbi) tweeted:
explosion at westgate.... how bad is it? — Ma Bradley (@NyamburaMumbi) September 21, 2013
In the immediate few minutes after after the news broke, however, it was still unclear what, exactly, was going on.
Naporneon Pornaparte (@aCreole) reflected this uncertainty in his tweet:
Explosion or gunfire? "@NyamburaMumbi: explosion at westgate.... how bad is it?" — Naporneon Pornaparte (@aCreole) September 21, 2013
For some, the location of the reported incident itself was under dispute.
Ramsy Ama Ramah (@ramjanja) suggested that initial reports claiming that an explosion had taken place at Westgate were mistaken:
yoh explosion ni mathare sio westgate RT @NyamburaMumbi: explosion at westgate.... how bad is it? — RAMSY AMA RAMAH (@ramjanja) September 21, 2013
yoh the explosion is in Mathare not Westgate Soon enough, however, it became clear that something ominous was taking place at the mall.
Confirmation of this came after the Ministry of Interior tweeted this update:
We urge Kenyans to keep away from Westgate mall in westlands until further notice cc @policeke @IGkimaiyo — InteriorCNG Ministry (@InteriorKE) September 21, 2013
What was emerging on the Twittersphere was that armed individuals had gone inside Westgate, journalistSmriti Vidyarthi (@SmritiVidyarthi) informed her Twitter followers:
STAY AWAY from Westgate Mall - heavily armed individuals shooting in the mall.
Inform family and friends to avoid the area. — Smriti Vidyarthi (@SmritiVidyarthi) September 21, 2013
Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo via his twitter account (@IGkimaiyo) confirmed that a police operation was underway:
Kindly keep off from Westgate Mall, Westland. Police has surrounded the area. — David Kimaiyo (@IGkimaiyo) September 21, 2013
Despite this update from the authorities, the nature of what they were responding to remained a mystery, even to them, at least based on what they were saying publicly, as revealed by Internal Security Ministry Permanent Secretary Mutea Iringo's comments to reporters:
PS #Mutea:We have sent air surveillance.We confirm there are armed criminals but haven't established who they're,let @PoliceKE do their job — InteriorCNG Ministry (@InteriorKE) September 21, 2013
But other sources within the Kenyan police started to realize that what they were confronting was more than an armed robbery.
Here is Robert Alai (@RobertAlai), one of the first to report that something more sinister was underway:
Many foreigners and locals shot in the #WestgateAttack. This is not a robbery - Police Source. — Robert A. (@RobertAlai) September 21, 2013
After images like these began to circulate, it was becoming clear that an act of terror had been perpetrated in Westgate: Don't look if you don't want to #westgate pic.twitter.com/fnXZOwGdPa — Alan Boswell (@alanboswell) September 21, 2013
Who is behind the Westgate attack?
At about 11 p.m. in the evening, President Uhuru Kenyatta addressed the nation and confirmed that what was happening in Westgate was, indeed, a terror attack.
Via KTN:
Mr. Kenyatta was sombre and informed his people the enormity of what Kenya was experiencing:
This morning, a group of armed terrorists forcefully entered the Westgate Mall in Nairobi’s Parklands area and unleashed senseless violence upon customers and workers.
They have killed at least 39 innocent people and injured more than 150 others.
With the entire nation, I stand with the families of those who have lost their lives and extend every Kenyan’s deepest condolences.
Later, it would be reported that he too had lost loved ones:
According to reports, the president’s nephew, Mbugua and his fiancée Wahito, were shot dead during the attack and from a witness account, Mbugua had made it safely out of the building when he realised that his fiancee was still stuck in the building.
He rushed back to get her only to be shot dead together with his fiancee.
Despite the confirmation that the Westgate attack was an act of terrorism, it was still unclear who had perpetrated it.
In his statement to the nation, President Kenyatta did not name assign responsibility to any specific group.
But soon, a Twitter handle believed to be controlled by Al-Shabaab, a Somali Islamist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.
The account has since been suspended, but their claim of responsibility is captured in this Storify piece by Canoe News.
Robert Alai was also able to capture an image of the Al-Shabaab alleged Twitter page before it was taken down:
And #AlShabaab now say that they will soon post the video of #WestgateAttack pic.twitter.com/Q2sRBBkSF4 — Robert A. (@RobertAlai) September 21, 2013
Indeed, hours later, a YouTube clip purporting to be by Al-Shabaab was posted online.
In grandiose and religious tones, the message was chilling:
Soon after, a group of Muslim Scholars reacted angrily to the claims by supposed members of Al-Shabab that their actions were committed in the name of Islam.
The Nigerian popular online platform, Nairaland, quoted a Sheikh Abu Eesa Niamatullah, denouncing what he called their turning of blood of civilians into cheap commodity.
He went on to say,
You never touched anything except that you destroyed it, you never entered a legitimate cause except that you corrupted it, you never came across the sanctity of human life except that you violated it, and you never tried to act in the name of Islam except that you polluted it.
So why now, Al-Shabaab?
The audacity of this attack has left some to suggest it may portend a new phase for the Somali Islamists.
In August of this year, analyst Abdihakim Ainte (@Abdikhakim) writing on the website Al-Monitor suggested that the defeats experienced by the group in Somalia at the hands of Ugandan and Kenyan troops has forced it to adopt a more guerrilla and assymetrical type of warfare.
To wit:
In a recent audio message, Ahmed Godane, al-Shabab’s operational brain, made it clear that he is determined to reverse the organization’s plummeting operations.
That includes, as he put it, plans to install a whole new generation who can interact with fast-moving jihadist warfare.
Unlike al-Shabab 1.0, the upgraded al-Shabab is likely to have new recruiters — mostly youths, under 30, who have exposure to the West and are fluent in foreign languages, to appeal to coming generations.
This seems evident in new footage released by al-Shabab featuring three young Somali-Americans who died while waging war.
The video “The Path to Paradise: From the Twin Cities to the Land of Migration” is part of al-Qaeda-approved propaganda messages to appeal to the next generation.
Meanwhile, Ken Menkhaus over at Think Progress concured that Al-Shabab is indeed weakened.
Menkhaus went on to argue that this latest gamble by the group was an attempt to reframe the terms of the conflict in Somalia:
The Westgate attack is the latest sign of the group’s weakness.
It was a desperate, high-risk gamble by Shabaab to reverse its prospects.
If the deadly attack succeeds in prompting vigilante violence by Kenyan citizens or heavy-handed government reactions against Somali residents, Shabaab stands a chance of recasting itself as the vanguard militia protecting Somalis against external enemies.
It desperately needs to reframe the conflict in Somalia as Somalis versus the foreigners, not as Somalis who seek peace and a return to normalcy versus a toxic jihadi movement.
On Twitter, Charles Onyango Obbo (@coboo3) disagreed, saying that the attack shows the metastasizing of Al-Shabaab:
@mmnjug @QulshTM Interesting, though my analysis is that Al-Shabaab is metamorphosing into a regional terror group, not declining. — Charles Onyango-Obbo (@cobbo3) September 22, 2013
A version of this perspective was echoed in the analysis from the website Somalia Newsroom, which argued that the Westgate attack was inevitable blowback from Kenya's continued operations in Somalia.
Additionally, they pointed out, a lack of a long-term strategic plan on how to combat terrorism by Kenya may explain Al-Shabaab's continued potency:
The Kenyan government may find more progress in combatting the influence of al-Shabaab and its sympathizers by building bridges between communities rather than scapegoating, offering under-served communities more resources to serve youth and families, and undertaking serious reform and accountability for security forces’ actions on civilians.
While Kenya’s current approach to al-Shabaab has garnered some successes, it has created tension in Somalia and left unaddressed shortcomings at home.
Rather than respond in blind rage to the Westgate attack, Kenya should meditate and answer soberly to the real questions that it is confronting in trying to increase stability at home and abroad.
There is no doubt that, as time goes by, more pondering and analysis will follow to reflect on the horrific events of 21 September.

Merchants from the Gamarra area, a well-known center of textile manufacturing and commercialization in Lima, burned imported Chinese clothing in the streets as a protest over the low priced Chinese garments which, according to them, make their businesses go bankrupt.
On Twitter, Alfredo "Alial" (@Alfredo_jch) implied a better use for those burnt clothes:

On September 21, 2013, a group of suspected al-Shabab militants stormed Westgate mall in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, killing at least 61 people, six security personnel and injuring hundreds of innocent men, women and children.
Following the horrible attack, Ushahidi has come up with two tools for emergencies.
Ushahidi is a non-profit technology company that specializes in developing free and open source software for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping.
"Ushahidi", which means "testimony" in Swahili, was a website that was initially developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008.
The Ping app is a binary, multichannel check-in tool for groups.
The tool will help families, friends and companies to quickly check in with each other:
There was a consistent problem in every disaster that happens, not just in Kenya, but everywhere.
Small groups, families and companies need to quickly check in with each other.
They need to “ping” one another to make sure they’re okay.
It has to be something incredibly simple, that requires little thinking to use.
People have been doing some stuff in this space in the past, the best like “I’m Ok” are focused on smartphone users, but we have a need to make it work for even the simplest phones.
Our goal is to have this available for anyone globally to use.
The Ping App – a group check-in tool for emergencies.
Photo source: Ushahidi blog.
This is how the Ping works:
You create a list of your people (family, organization), and each person also adds another contact who is close to them (spouse, roommate, boy/girlfriend, etc).
When a disaster happens, you send out a message for everyone to check-in.
The admin sends out a 120 character message that always has “are you ok?” appended to the end.
This goes out via text message and email (more channels can be added later).
The message goes out three times, once every 5 minutes.
If there is a response, then that person is considered okay.
If no response, then 3 messages get sent to their other contact.
We file each response into one of 3 areas: responded (verified), not responded, not okay.
Every message that comes back from someone in that group is saved into a big bucket of text, that the admin can add notes to if needed.
Another tool is Blood Donation Kenya, which is a crowdmap of all locations of blood drive centers.
The map matches blood location centers with people willing to help with donation, medical instruments or medical personnel.
A screenshot of a crowdmap showing blood donation sites in Kenya.
Image source: Ushahidi blog.
Erik Hersmann explains the logic behind the map:
One of the most amazing guys in Kenya in any emergency is Philip Ogola of the Kenya Red Cross.
He’s first on scene with great updates, but there’s only so much that one person can do.
Now, the Kenya Red Cross itself has been doing incredible work, but they have a problem with a lot of their stuff still being paper and pen (and there’s another group working on a locally hosted database system to digitize this without putting real people’s names online, run by Nivi of eLimu).
Another problem that they have is that the hospitals are running short on some types of blood, and are overwhelmed with others, as the Kenyan population comes out in full force to donate blood.
How can this be managed better, so that people aren’t turned away from some places and so that they know where to go for their type?
We set up a crowdmap deployment to map our all locations of blood drive centers, in an effort to match these areas with those willing to help at BloodDonationKenya.Crowdmap.com, either through blood donation, medical instruments or medical personnel.

There have long been rumors that Vladimir Putin has a romantic relationship with Uzbekistan-born former gymnast Alina Kabaeva.
Indeed, the speculation predates Putin's divorce, which he announced to the press in June 2013.
In the last week, the gossip has flared up again, and this time the RuNet's busybodies suspect that Putin (age 60) and Kabaeva (age 30) may finally have tied the knot.
It started with a mid-afternoon tweet on Saturday:
I am told that Putin and Kabaeva were married today in the Iversky Monastery.
All of Valdai is cordoned off.
This message, written by lawyer Koloy Akhilgov, grabbed over 500 retweets, and sent the Russian blogosphere scrambling for more information.
A few hours later, Akhilgov reported:
Friends, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the facts, but locals reported the FSO blocked off everything and everyone around Iversky.
A parody Twitter account that mocks Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, soon tweeted:
Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich is married!
Though not to Alina Kabaeva, but to the kingdom.
Within hours of Akhilgov's first tweet, Dmitry Peskov went on TV Dozhd (TV Rain) and denied the rumors, reproving the blogosphere for its chatter, and accusing netizens of “Internet exercises on Saturday out of boredom.”
This seemingly vague denial only heightened the buzz online.
For instance, LiveJournal user Egor Sedov argued that Peskov had only stoked the flames of the rumor and made it an even bigger story.
I had not heard these rumors.
But now I have.
Whom can I say thank?
Mr. Peskov, that's who!
If Peskov had said nothing, the rumors (even if they are true) would have died down by themselves.
But not now.
Another thing: is Kabaeva a Muslim?
Or no?
If she is a Muslim, is a wedding possible?
Also commenting on the religious aspect of a potential Putin-Kabaeva union, another blogger speculated that Kabaeva has converted to Orthodoxy, in order to marry Putin.
Blogger Pasha Businessman urged the blogosphere to calm down and stop spreading unfounded rumors:
I think that all of these rumors are just inventions.
Except for the rumors, nothing is confirmed by other sources.
Not one photograph, not one video, and so on.
It does not matter what the press office says.
Besides stuffing the tabloids and all the tabloid journalists, there are no other facts that Putin met with Kabaeva.
Lord, journalists, let’s not run ahead of the engine.
Get the facts, get a handle on them, verify using independent sources, and then publish.
On her Facebook wall, journalist Natalia Gevorkyan wondered why the Kremlin has to make everything a “special operation," noting how Putin waited for wide speculation in the media to accumulate before announcing his divorce.
How many years did he not live with his wife before going to the theatre for an interview about his divorce?
Now will he live as many years in this marriage before it is announced?
Maybe, however, at the Olympic games.... Somehow logical-symbolic .
The odds are that the gossip about Putin's remarriage is just that.
But if Gevorkyan is right that Putin is waiting for another unexpected, well-attended setting for the dramatic reveal, we may have to wait until next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Did we open the way?
Or is the path destroyed?...

Haze in Sumatra.
Photo by @jgblogs
Nearly 500 forest fires were recorded in Sumatra Island last August which caused a thick haze to descend on Riau in Indonesia and even in some parts of Malaysia.
The burning of forests is blamed on the operations of oil palm plantations, wood suppliers’ concessions, and pulpwood plantations.
Several schools were closed in Riau during the return of the deadly haze last week.
The haze pollution is a recurring problem in the region caused mainly by forest fires in Indonesia.
Last June, the haze covered Singapore and many areas in Malaysia.

On Twitter, Indonesians expressed their concern about the return of the haze in Sumatra.

The unexpected release of two Spanish aid workers from Doctors Without Borders, kidnapped on October 13, 2011, was announced following 21 months of captivity.

It is also unclear if their captors were common criminals or members of a faction of Al Qaeda, though most observers attribute the incident to terrorists.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) called a press conference following the news, but José Antonio Bastos, President of (MSF) Spain, said they could not release information on the liberation process "so as not to compromise the rest of the volunteers in Somalia nor the informants."
It has been MSF who has partaken in the negotiations to free the volunteer workers.
The Spanish state has not intervened.
What has not been revealed is whether ransom was paid, the amount that could have been paid, or who has taken responsibility for the supposed payment.
Many celebrated the release of the two women, such as Beli Álvarez , who tweeted:
@Beli_Alvarez: A message of love and welcoming to the two Spanish aid workers from @MSF_espana Congratulations to this NGO for their great work in the world
Nevertheless, not all were messages of congratulations.
Many netizens took for granted that the Spanish state had paid the ransom for aid workers and expressed their dissatisfaction, sometimes accusing the aid workers of being reckless and seeking their own misfortune.
burbman89 left this comment to the news, which appeared on 20minutos.es :
Come on, it has cost all of us Spaniards so much money for these "good Samaritans" to go there to make them feel good about themselves.... why won't they just stay home!!!!
In the same media outlet, 1-2-3-4 blamed the volunteers for potential Al Qaeda attacks in the future:
Doctors Without Borders Spain press conference to announce the release of the two volunteer workers.
Image published on Twitter by DWB Press.
(...) the Islamists will buy weapons with the millions of euros that we have given them.
Weapons with which the Islamists will kidnap more Westerners and murder many Africans.
Weapons with which they will carry out attacks.
The harm caused by these "aid workers" is incalculable.
In his column, "The state is no longer what it was" , in La Gaceta magazine, Rafael Bardají says that
Are no longer neutral elements that are respected, but rather another piece in the conflicts.
And that is something that affects not only their personal security, but that of the entire State (...).
Paying them for what they do and paying for the release of their members is amoral and unsustainable.
In the same vein, Ricardo Peytaví shares his opinion in his column "Altruism that we all pay for" in the online newspaper El Día
The only thing that I want to know is how much this all costs me in terms of the share, given that this month I have paid over a third of my gross income in taxes. (...) any citizen of this country has become an easy piece for everything criminal that wants to make easy money.
Nonetheless, there have also been many netizens and bloggers who are pleased with the happy outcome of the kidnapping, and praised the work of the volunteers and the organization in a community so vulnerable like that of the refugees.
Belén de la Banda spoke about this on the blog 3500 millones :
Blanca, Montse, and their colleagues are the moral examples that we need in these times of uncertainty and mistrust. (...) our society should look for a way to feel our embrace, to acknowledge the enormous effort and valuable work that has led them to this extreme situation.
Because people like them make our country and our world better.
And 1358 left this comment on the news appearing on El País :
The volunteers at their arrival to Spain following their release.
Image from the RTVE website.
I am joining those who ARE HAPPY for the return home of these two People and as a TAXPAYER it SEEMS VERY GOOD to me if their release has had to be paid for.
Life, even the lives of those who we do not like, has no price and it is much better to spend money (if it has been done) on PEOPLE than on cowboys and indians games so that four SLACKERS play and believe themselves to be chonvaine on "missions" of "peace" and "reconstruction."
Regardless of the controversy that has been created around the payment of their rescue, the good news is that Montserrat Serra and Blanca Thiebaut are with their families, safe and sound.
The DWB doctors and psychologists that have tended to them since their release have advised that they be given some time to recuperate and adapt to day to day life once again, meaning people will have to wait some time before they can talk about what they lived through these 21 months in captivity.
They have only been seen getting off the plane in the Madrid airport, extremely skinny and appearing exhausted, but smiling.
Hopefully they have a speedy recovery and return to their normal lives soon.
A screenshot from the petition calling for the minister's resignation.
According to Uganda's Youth Affairs Minister Ronald Kibuule, women who are dressed indecently are asking to be raped, and suspects who have raped such women should be released.
He also said that in cases of rape, police should first ascertain the dress code of the victim, and if they were dressed indecently, they should also be charged with inviting the crime.
Kibuule made the comments in Kajara County, Ntungamo District on Saturday September 21, 2012, while attending the launch of Kajara Youth Development Cooperative and Savings Society.
The comments appeared on Uganda's newspaper Daily Monitor on September 24, 2013.
The article, however, did not explain the context in which Kibuule made the comments.
The parliament has summoned the minister to appear before it to explain the comment he made last week.
Ugandan netizens responded in fury to the comments using the hashtag #Kibuule on Twitter.
Those calling for his resignation are using the hashtags #KibuuleMustGo and #KibuuleOut.
A petition on Change.org calls for his resignation:
By these words, Mr. Kibuule is promoting the rape of women based on their dress code; he is excusing rapists for their crimes against supposedly scantily clad women and; he is ensuring that victims of rape are afraid to come forward for fear of being persecuted for being raped.
He should lose his position immediately since he clearly does not represent the well being of his constituents.
Rosebell Kagumire (@RosebellK), a Ugandan online journalist, wrote:
4000 children in northern #uganda are defiled annually, I bet #kibuule thinks its because they were provocative!

President of the Gambia Yahya Jammeh addresses the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September, 2013.
During his speech, he condemned homosexuality, calling it one of the "biggest threats to human existence".

The tiny West African State of The Gambia has announced via state television that it will withdraw from the Commonwealth of Nations, a fellowship of 54 countries that are mainly former colonies of the British Empire.
A statement released on Wednesday, 2 October 2013 stated that "the government has withdrawn its membership of the British Commonwealth and decided that the Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism."
No further reasons have been advanced by the government, but relations between the Gambia and the UK in 2013 have been rocky.
In April, the UK Foreign Office's annual Human Rights and Democracy Report was critical of the country's human rights record under President Yahya Jammeh, highlighting violations such as unlawful detentions, illegal closures of newspapers and discrimination against minority groups.
The country's response to the report was sharp: "Britain has no moral authority to dictate moral standards of rectitude and democracy to any former colony in Africa”.
After the Gambia announced the decision to dump its membership of the international body headed by Queen Elizabeth II, netizens around the globe have reacted with mix feelings.
Mathew Jallow, an exiled Gambian journalist, saw the move as good for publicising President Jammeh's "stupidity".
Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup, for years has earned the world's ire for his repressive rule, one that has been defined by executions, restricted freedom of the press and expression, persecution of homosexuals, and heavy-handed supression of political dissent:
Behind every dark cloud, there is a silver lining.
Yahya Jammeh's Gambia withdrawal from the Commonwealth is more negative publicity worth one year's newspaper reporting.
Today, ever country in the world will carry this withdrawal news and every Commonwealth member state, including the US, will have every lingering doubt about our claims, confirmed.
This is what dictators do all the time.
They create their own downfalls as they attempt to solidify their rules and barricade themselves within their crumbling worlds.
Thank you Yahya Jammeh.
All our efforts could not have publicized your stupidity better.
Commenting on his Facebook wall, Gambian journalist Sainey MK Marena analyzed the situation (post used with permission):
Gambia withdrawal from the Commonwealths attracts international headlines.
The multi -million dollar question is why are we withdrawing our membership at a time when countries like Mozambique and others are seriously yearning to join the global body.
Gambia has and continued to benefit from commonwealth in diverse areas including education/scholarship, sports and most recently the commonwealth proposed National Human Rights Commission.
MY point is Gambia like any nation has right to withdraw from any association or organization but is should be based on credible and genuine reason (s).
In 2003, Zimbabwe Under Mugabe withdraw from the Commonwealth for reasons best known to them but smallest country in the mainland African should take a different take and approached.
However, Sefa-Nyarko Clement seemed to disagree, writing on Facebook:
Great move, Gambia.
Although I don't subscribe to the summary executions and despotic policies of Baba Jammeh, I support his withdrawal from the Commonwealth.
Indeed, the Commonwealth of Nations has outlived its usefulness.
On Twitter, user Abdou ‏(@abs2ray) criticised the president's behaviour:
I'm not against the Gambia withdrawing from the commonwealth in principle but as usual Yaya is acting erratically once again. #Gambia — Abdou (@abs2ray) October 3, 2013
While the discussion on the Jammeh’s latest diplomatic rumbling continues, it remains unclear what the poorly impoverished nation will gain by quitting the Commonwealth.
Do you care about free speech on the Internet?
What about your privacy online?
What if your government created a law that could protect these rights, rather than threatening them?
Brazilian digital rights advocates have been working for years to pass the Marco Civil da Internet, a one-of-a-kind law that would protect key rights and freedoms on the Internet.
US government surveillance programs have brought new momentum to the issue, galvanizing support from civil society and even Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff.
This week on GV Face, our Advocacy Editor Ellery Biddle (@ellerybiddle) talks with leading experts on the issue, including GV author Raphael Tsavkko @Tsavkko, Carolina Rossini (@carolinarossini) and Joana Varon (@joana_varon) an original author of the bill.

On October 26, 2013 thousands of Saudi women have vowed to defy the kingdom's ban on female driving.
In this week's edition of GV Face, we meet Jeddah-based blogger and writer Tamador Alyami, who is supporting the #Women2Drive campaign.
We are also joined by Hadeel Mohammed, our Saudi Author based in Dammam and our MENA Editor Amira Al Hussaini.
We talked about the campaign, life for women in Saudi, and how activists handle naysayers like the cleric who recently said "we find that most of those who drive cars continuously deliver children with varying degrees of clinical dysfunction.”
GV Face is hosted by our Managing Editor Solana Larsen and Deputy Editor Sahar Habib Ghazi.

A coalition of concerned individuals and NGOs, Hong Kong for Elephants, rallied on October 4 in the city center calling on the Hong Kong Government to destroy its entire stockpile of 25 tonnes of confiscated ivory.
The local rally is a solidarity action with the International March for Elephants organized by The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust under the iworry campaign.

The local anti-Ivory action was launched with a petition by Lucy Lan Skrine aged 11 and Christina Seigrist aged 8 at Avaaz.org in mid September calling for the destruction of confiscated ivory in order to send a strong signal to Chinese consumers that buying ivory is immoral and wrong.
The two school kids are studying in Hong Kong, a major port in the illegal global trade of ivory on route from Africa to mainland China.
In an interview with inmediahk.net, they said that they love animals and wanted to stop the massive killing of elephants by helping to give them a voice.
The two girls become the spokespersons for Hong Kong for Elephants.

Despite the active crackdown of ivory smugglers by the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department in the implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), it has been difficult for the authorities to identify and prosecute the smugglers.
Furthermore, domestic trade of ivory accessories is allowed both in Hong Kong and in mainland China.
When the illegal raw ivory is successfully smuggled to mainland China via Hong Kong, it is wholesaled to carvers and manufacturers, turned into luxurious products and circulated in the domestic market through both licensed businesses and underground black market.
That's why international anti-ivory trade campaigns, such as Save All Elephants, are calling for a a stop to ivory carving industry in China:
China is the driving factor in the ivory trade, yet claims they are not responsible for poaching.
It is their carving in their massive factories which produce all the items for people to buy.
Carving is the Bottle Neck of the trade.
China is at fault, the ivory is in their literal laps to be carved.
They must be called out on it, and you, the activist, is the one to do it, the one to ask your government to demand that China stop so that elephants have their right to life.
This is also a long term goal for Hong Kong for Elephants.
On October 4, around 30 animal activists rallied along the Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, a most touristic area in Hong Kong.
Apart from raising public awareness, the coalition will submit the signatures collected from the online petition to the Hong Kong government and hasarranged a meeting with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department to discuss their petition to destroy the stockpiles of confiscated ivory.
As the coalition explained, destroying the stockpiles is only a start, their mission is to ban the domestic ivory trade:
Christine wants consumers aware that buying of ivory products is equal to killing of elephants.
Photo from Hong Kong for Elephants.
We also want the Chinese government to ban its domestic ivory trade, to shut down the shops selling ivory products and to close down the 37 state-owned ivory carving factories across the country.
But first we want you to sign our petition asking the Hong Kong government to crush and burn the stockpile of ivory.
We want Hong Kong to send a message to the world that ivory isn’t welcome here and we won’t allow our city to be any part of this cruel trade.
Think about the elephants that died to create that 25 tonne pile of tusks.
We must do all we can to make sure they didn’t die for nothing…

Presidents of Iran and US: Hassan Rouhani and Barack Obama.
Via Iran-emrooz.net
Just one week after a historic phone call between Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, and Barack Obama, there were still Iranians chanting the customary “Death to America” and burning US and Israeli flags after Friday prayers in Tehran on October 4, 2013.
Still, some Iranians hope the call was a step towards thawing relations that could someday lead to US sanctions being lifted.
Others are unhappy about any dialogue with "the Great Satan," as the United States is most often referred to in Iran's official speeches.
As an indication that this topic also on President Rouhani's mind, he has reportedly asked two polling organizations to "find out" what Iranians think about USA-Iran relations.
Meanwhile, netizens share their own ideas about the ongoing saga between the two countries.
- "How many people want the Islamic Republic regime?"
- "What do they think about social and political freedom?"
- "You said there was no fraud in the controversial 2009 presidential election, let's ask what Iranians think about it"
Zarebin writes in his blog that the survey will be engineered in whatever which way the Supreme Leader wants.
If he wishes to improve the relationship with the USA, then the survey will reflect this. And if not, the survey will reflect that.
"What a trap we are stuck in.
Everything is the Leader's opinion with a survey to cover it up."
To Talk or not to Talk
Firoozeh tweeted:
In any relationship, whether diplomatic or non-diplomatic, we should not rush things.
Siding with the Islamic regime, blogger Khabrnegar1351 writes that Iran has become so powerful that the USA "looks to Iran as superpower" and "aims to improve relations with Tehran out of fear."
َAnother blogger, Ahestan, reminds us of the anti-American teachings of Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's founder and says , "The real winner of the Obama-Rouhani phone conversation is Obama."
This blogger says the main goal of the phone call was to show the millions of Muslims who follow the Imam teachings that Iran is willing to negotiate with "the Great Satan."

As the conflict between the rebels of Sékéla and the national army of the Central african Republic rages on, tension mounts in the city of Bossangoa.
Locals fear that the conflict may not spill into open fighting between the christian and muslim communities.
Some still hold hope for appeasement though, like the Iman of the downtown mosque :
This is also our country, we were born here.
But out christian brethren still see us as strangers.They think we are the cause of their sorrow and we do not know why.
We too still hope for peace..
The humanitarian crisis in the country is getting worse by the day.
Hippolyte Donossio reports that 150 people were killed and thousands of homes were burnt by the rebels during the week-end.
Occasional blogger, John Bocskay had an interview with travel writer Rolf Potts who championed the famed word ‘vegabond’. Potts, who spent several years in South Korea’s second largest city, Pusan, said:
Every second person at a given expat bar claimed to be a writer or artist, but you never saw much writing or art.
It was all very bitter and petty and self-defeating, and I didn’t begin to write about Korea in a meaningful away until I learned to keep that expat crowd (friends and coworkers included) at arm’s-length and experience the city on quieter, more Korean terms.

30 years ago (October 15, 1983), a march for equality against racism began in Marseille with 32 people, mostly of Arab origin, to ask for the right to vote and a 10-year resident card.
The Beurs' March (Beur is a colloquial french term for people with roots in Northern Africa) arrived in Paris on December 3 with more than 60,000 people having joined in the initial set of marchers.
Numerous events are celebrating the anniversary all over France, though in a complicated context given the rapid rise of the far-right in France.
The following video is one of the many media productions commemorating the anniversary :
David Oliveira de Souza, a doctor and professor from the Research Institute of the Sirio-Libanés Hospital, sent an open letter to the more than four hundred Cuban doctors who recently arrived in Brazil and who constitute the first group of a total of 4,000 physicians who are expected to come to this country before December of this year.

The missive, published by the daily Folha from Sao Paulo, states:
Welcome, Cuban doctors.
You will be very important for Brazil.
The lack of doctors in remote and outlying areas have left our people in a difficult situation.
Do not worry about hostility from some of our colleagues.
You will be compensated greatly by the warm welcome in the communities for which you will care from this point on.
According to Oliveira de Souza, in states like Sergipe, it is easy to move from the capital to the Interior, but even so there are hundreds of unused job positions, even in equipped health units and in good conditions.
Before the deficit of 14,500 physicians in the South American nation, the government of Dilma Rousseff approved the "Mais Medicos" (More Doctors) program, which will contract doctors from Spain, Portugal, and Cuba, among other nations.
Recently, one of the principle critiques on the contracting of Cubans states that "they were being exploited."
In the face of this argument, Oliveira de Souza says in his letter:
It was talked about as if they would work like slaves.
The Panamerican Health Organization (PHO), with a century of experience, would be an accomplice, since it signed the cooperation agreement with the government of Brazil.
Their smiling faces in the airports condemn those hypotheses.
In the name of our village and the majority of our doctors, I can only say with conviction: a brotherly hug and thank you very much.
Teah Abdullah lists 5 issues Brunei citizens need to discuss: Upholding a realistic language, incest, overindulgence, excessive number of burger joints, and overdependence on the government.
She elaborates on the last issue:
...our government is such a strong part in our everyday lives, but our dependency on them is problematic because it is as if we can't solve our own troubles.
We are creating an extra strain at making the government solve all the little problems in our lives.

The crimes against women are on the rise in India.
Writer and blogger Shilpa Garg provides some tips on how women can stay alert and safe.
Raza Habib Raja at Pak Tea House comments:
The biggest 'crime' in Pakistan is to be what I call, Non-Muslim Muslims.
So if you are an Ahmedi, Shiite, and even a believer in some Sufi Saint you will invariably be called Non-Muslim by some.
That brings one to the question "Who is a Muslim?"
Raja tells:
Asking this question is dangerous and trying to define a Muslim is futile and would invariably lead to exclusion of many who do not belong to the sect of the person who is asking the question.

Award-winning photographer Geoffrey Hiller first visited Myanmar in 1987; and he was ‘haunted’ by what he saw in the country:
After a frenetic trip, it wasn’t so much the monks and pagodas that haunted me, but the faces of the Burmese, painted in white, often smiling.
I wanted to find out more about who they really were, plagued by a corrupt government and international sanctions.
He has since then returned to Myanmar several times and he witnessed the changes that have taken place in the country in recent years:
I returned yet again in 2013.
My camera focused on capturing daily life, from the cramped streets of the colonial capital of Yangon, to dusty markets in Mandalay, to Muslims in Meikhtila, and river life in Pathein.
The face of Yangon has already changed, with new building construction and imported cars.
He plans to publish a book through a Kickstarter project that would include his photographs documenting life inside Myanmar from 1987 through the recent historic transition.
The book, Burma in Transition, would also feature photos of Meiktila which Hiller visited before riots erupted in the town:
After my experience in this peaceful town, the news reports about the fighting and killing and burning of homes is unbelievable to me.
I had talked with dozens of residents of Meiktila, both Buddhists and Muslims, and I never would have guessed such violence would erupt
Pledge to the book project can be made through Kickstarter until October 9.

It seems that Spain is not very happy.
According to a study by Carlos III University in Madrid (uc3m) , Spaniards rank 49th in happiness out of the 112 countries polled.
This happiness index (pdf) is based not on subjective questions, but on "revealed preferences," using migration as a standard; that is, what people do, not what they say.
Per Juan de Dios Tena , a statistics professor at Carlos III University: "Migration flows are closely linked to psychological issues related to happiness," that is, people tend to leave a country if it lacks the conditions for their happiness, in favor of someplace where they think they can be happy.
The researchers took into account both economic and non-economic factors of happiness, which overlap with what can be considered the determining factors of migration: absolute and relative income, demographic and social characteristics, social development, relationships with others and characteristics of the place where one lives, as well as variables like distance or a common border and language.
Considering all these factors, and led by Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand, Spain is 49th out of the 112 countries in the ranking, followed by Mexico, Iran and Costa Rica, among others.
In last place are countries like Afghanistan, South Africa and China.
Tena also claims that migration flows don't just depend on the possibility of finding work, as is commonly thought, but are also influenced by pollution, terrorism and economic inequality, variables that psychologists consider determinants of happiness.
The study concludes that well-being cannot be solely measured by per capita income and notes that good policies increase the willingness of people to live in their country, while bad ones reduce that willingness.
Here are some relevant Tweets:

Limpeh noted the proliferation of higher education institutions in Singapore.
Is this good or bad for Singapore?
...has this expansion in choices been at the wrong end of the market?
So whilst this expansion may have generation jobs for some people (which is a good thing), how many parents want to actually see their children end up in one of these institutes catering for the lower end of the market...
@LaotianMama reminds Lao mothers not to give sticky rice, a traditional Lao food, to hungry babies:
Sticky rice for infants is the Laotian equivalent to what we know as rice cereal in Western culture.
The idea is the same as well where the introduction of solid foods will fill out their little bellies.
Well, of course, introducing a near-empty food so early can be quite harmful to children’s developing gut and can cause problems such as food allergies, stunted development, and breastfeeding difficulty.
Yemeni blogger Abdulkader Alguneid finds an owl outside his window:
He tweets the rare occurrence:
A person who created a fake Facebook account in the name of Zambia’s former first lady Maureen Mwanawasa recently appeared in court for fraud.
Mwanawasa, the wife of Zambia’s third president, the late Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, who ruled for seven years until his death in 2008, runs a non-government organisation called the Maureen Mwanawasa Community Initiative (MMCI), which helps underprivileged people in society.
The NGO was very active when her husband was in power and received support from a number of organisations and individuals.
It has since scaled down its operations and it is only active in one or two areas, notably Kapiri Mposhi where it runs a school for underprivileged children.
Details about the case are scant, but Mwanawasa, a lawyer herself, appeared in court and tweeted her reasons for her attendence in response to questions from Twitter users:
@NizaSich someone has created a face book page in my name and she collects 250$ for false scholarships she has been arrested#Zambia — Maureen K Mwanawasa (@mwanachilembo) October 3, 2013
Zambia's former First Lady Maureen Mwanawasa courtesy of her Twitter account.
The Zambian Watchdog reported a potential scam in January 2012, but it is not clear if it is related to the present court case.
Quoting whistleblower Laston Nyirenda, the website reported:
I am friends with the said person and they started sending me messages purporting to be Mrs Mwanawasa and started asking me to lend them $2000 and send it to the person named Florence Lucky who they said is based in Madrid, Spain and want me to send the money using western union.
They even provided me a Zambian phone number I can call stating that it is for the former first lady if I want to confirm and when I called the number, the person who answered is based in Kitwe and it is not even Mrs Mwanawasa.
After Mwanawasa made it known on Twitter that she was in court, one user asked the former first lady how it felt to be cross-examined:
She responded:
@EricKamocha naturally it felt strange but it was a good experience — Maureen K Mwanawasa (@mwanachilembo) October 3, 2013
Mwanawasa’s tweets did not give a lot of details about the case such as the name of the culprit and where she is based.
The former first lady, however, is not the first high profile Zambian who has had her profile faked.
Recently, a Facebook page in the name of the country’s Vice President Dr. Guy Scott, cropped up sending “friend requests” to people who usually comment on political issues on the social networking site.
When the Facebook page purported to belong to Dr. Scott emerged, citizen media website Zambian Eye reported about it, although there were questions on its authenticity:
The all (whole lot) of Guy Scott to be sending friendship requests to every Jim and Jack on Facebook.
Doesn’t take you to be a genius to figure out this are accounts operated by the PF fake generals on Facebook that want to use it to collect data.
Wake up people.
Dr Scott was latter quoted by the Zambia Intelligence News, saying:
I opened an account in 2011 for campaign purposes and I have not opened any account since then.
I have not used it since then so everything else that is propping up now is fake.
The whole thing is a fraud.
It is basically fraudulent.

Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms in recorded history, has killed thousands in central Philippines.
According to our local authors many more are stranded, without food, water and aid, in a wasteland that used to be their homes.
Aid is simply not arriving quickly enough to these communities that survived Haiyan, locally referred to as Yolanda.
A week after the super typhoon hit the provinces of Leyte and Samar, in the Visayas islands, we'll be talking to our Philippine authors and an aid worker about how the country is coping with the disaster, the progress in rescue operations, and what we - the concerned international community - can do to help.
In this week's episode of GV Face, our South East Asia Editor Mong Palatino (@mongster) joins us from Manila, along with activist and video journalist Chantal Eco (@chantaleco), who is coordinating relief efforts in Manila for her native Leyte. Some highlights from the conversation:

If there were to be real peace in this stateless zone, the price to pay (May my Malian friends forgive me) might be to renounce peace temporarily.

Against the background of the setting up of a new national security committee, the question to be addressed is:
How might the Party re-tool and redefine its approach to the internet and social media in light of its shifting approach to national security?
Colin Meyn explains how the 'rapid spread of social media is altering Cambodia’s political landscape.'
The young electorate desirous of change plus the aggressive campaigning of the opposition in the Internet made a huge impact in the recent elections.
Interestingly, the Prime Minister also mentioned Facebook several times in his first major speech during the opening of the parliament: “The government has no policy to close Facebook, but I would like to appeal to people not to let Facebook become a tool to damage social stability and insult people."

A 1,500 km-long railway project between Niamey, the capital city of Niger and Cotonou, the capital city of Benin has been green lighted by the authorities of the two countries and construction will begin on March 2014 .
Francois Ndiaye in Niamey unpacks the set up of the financial agreement that includes multiple stakeholders and will be overseen by the investment group Bolloré .
Benoît ILLASSA in Cotonou wonders why private investing groups from either Niger or Cotonou were not selected to pilot such projects. The projected budget is set at 100 billions CFA (about 2 billions USD).
The railway should extend in the future to three other capital cities of the west african region : Abidjan, Ouagadougou and Lomé.

Leopold Sudaryono tackles the problem of prison overcrowding in Indonesia.
In 2011, there were 144,000 prisoners in the country.
Prisons were reported to be overcrowded by 45 per cent on average.
Among the factors contributing to the problem are lack of alternative sentencing options at trial and delays in the administration of the criminal justice system.
In the Indonesian context, prison overcrowding is a sign of a disintegrating criminal justice system, in which law enforcement agencies prioritise the function of their own institutions at the expense of other parts of the system.

Prominent Egyptian activist and blogger Alaa Abd El Fattah was arrested in his home at approximately 10pm on Thursday, November 28.
An arrest warrant was issued for Abd El Fattah this past Tuesday, following violent dispersal of protestors in Cairo.
The blogger's father told local media he believed the arrest was made under a new law effectively banning street protest in Egypt.
At least 51 people were arrested that day, among them several prominent activists.
Many were beaten and sexually harrassed.
Alaa was taken by police despite having declared that he'd deliver himself to the police on Saturday, according to a statement he made and that his aunt, renowned Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif, posted on Facebook.
According to his wife, Manal, police used violent force when the arrest took place:
Alaa's arrest shows why MOI wanted this law w the vague language in Art7= to give them them the discretion to arrest any activist they want — hebamorayef (@hebamorayef) November 28, 2013
Hesham Mansour offered his own ironic response:
Don't ask what Egypt has done for us.
Ask how many times did Egypt arrest Alaa
Activist Mona Seif, Alaa's sister, informed her followers of her brother's detention location:
We are now sure that Alaa is being held in the CSF barracks in giza, on the Cairo - Alexandria desert road
Alaa Abd El Fattah was jailed under Hosni Mubarak's regime for 45 days and again by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in 2011, when he remained in jail for almost two months. He also faced charges under Mohamed Morsi's government in 2013, along with popular satirist Bassem Youssef, in what many perceived to be politically motivated charges used as an intimidation tactic.
Each time, the #FreeAlaa hashtag has resurfaced to show solidarity.
It seems that this is back on track.
In this week's edition of the Kenyan online magazine Brainstorm, Brenda Wambui rails against the ongoing narratives about Africa: "Africa is a country", "Africa rising", '"African fashion".
She looks at ways Kenyans can reclaim their story and define themselves on their own terms:
As Kenya, or any other country, we should define who we are, what we stand for, what we expect of other countries we interact with, and what we will and will not accept.
We should forge this identity independent of others’ expectations and preconceptions. Then, we should stand by it.
Saying who you are is not enough, you also have to show who you are by how you act.

Tropical storm Maring (international name Trami) caused record high floods in Metro Manila and nearby provinces in the Philippines which left 8 people dead, 41 injured, and 4 missing.
According to a government report, 125,348 families (602,442 persons) were affected by the storm.
As of August 20 in the evening, 40,837 persons are still sheltered in 198 evacuation centers.
The flood made 65 major roads impassable.
About 415 areas in 68 municipalities/cities recorded flood cases.
A total of 162 flights (59 international and 103 domestic) have been cancelled due to the storm.
Filipinos used the hashtag #maringPH and #floodPH to monitor the flood situation in Manila and nearby regions.
Below are some photos on Twitter and Facebook which show the extent of the flooding disaster.

The final mayoral campaign rally of opposition party MDM in Beira ended with three people killed and several injured - the injured included the candidate's own son - following an attack by riot police who used tear gas grenades and shot bullets to the air.
When the tumult began, incumbent mayor Daviz Simango was preparing to take the stage and call on the crowd to vote once again for the main opposition party MDM (Mozambique Democratic Movement), in power in the second largest city of Mozambique, also the capital of the province of Sofala.
Unrest in Beira set in on November 16, the second to last day of the electoral campaign for Mozambique's municipal elections.
The vote will take place on November 20, 2013. @Verdade newspaper is gathering citizen reports in a special website for the elections.
"Unrest set in and citizens tried to flee in disarray while FIR agents kept shooting. "

Even though the Japanese government is working toward advancing its open data policy, the country has a ways to go, ranking 30th out of 70 countries, according to an index compiled by Open Knowledge Foundation.
Masahiko Shoji of Open Knowledge Foundation Japan writes:
Japan's open data on government spending, company register, transport timetables and legislation received low ratings.
All data set fields were not able to receive an evaluation of "YES". Such challenges are the same as that of the ratings among the G8 compiled by Open Knowledge Foundation in June this year, and it shows that the progress of Open Data efforts in Japan is small.

InSerbia reports and adds details to a poll carried out by Serbian daily Blic on whether the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose clergymen have recently been in the media often due to reports of visible overspending, should begin paying taxes.
The Serbian Orthodox Church and all other religious institutions are exempt from taxes in Serbia and state tax authorities have never inspected the finances of any registered religious community in the country.
These benefits, however, only apply to products and services that serve for religious activities, while the Serbian Orthodox Church is known to have a variety of the most expensive vehicles in the ownership of the Church, used by its officials and employees.
In the public poll conducted by Blic in early November 2013, 83% of the respondents said the Serbian Orthodox Church should pay taxes.
Rough estimates, derived from the statements of church dignitaries, indicates that only from VAT on the sale of books and other goods in church stores, as well as profit tax, the Republic budget could be richer for about 10 billion dinars (6.4 million euros/8.5 million dollars).

As Global Voices reported, some netizens say they will vote for the incumbent president during November 6 elections in Tajikistan because a "full leader is better than a hungry one".
Reflecting on this, Salimi Aioubzod suggests it is "sad" that voters in the country are more concerned about how "full" or "hungry" a presidential candidate is than about the candidate's platform.
Yet the blogger argues that if the voters wish to know how "full" a candidate is, they have the right to know that:
...t would be good if the Central Commission for Elections and Referendums of Tajikistan (CCERT) demanded that all presidential candidates declare their annual income and its sources...
Making public a candidate's income and its origins, their movables and real assets, and their bank accounts will allow to see whether the candidate is "full" or "hungry"...
Representatives of the organizations that manage the technical infrastructure of the Internet meeting in Montevideo, Uruguay, have released a Declaration on the future of Internet cooperation , in which they analyze the problems currently affecting the future of the Internet.
Among other things, they mention the importance of globally consistent Internet operations and warn against the fragmentation of the Internet at a national level, while expressing their concern about the global decrease in confidence of Internet users due to the recent revelations of monitoring and surveillance.
This can, in some way, be considered as a response to proposals that go in that direction, such as that recently advanced by the president of Brazil, Dilma Roussef, before the UN and to the activities of the NSA.
In a video released Monday, August 12, the soccer team Grêmio of Porto Alegre brought together some of the key players on its roster, white and black, to talk about racism.
The initiative was carried out in support of a new FIFA initiative, implemented in May of this year and unanimously approved, that made punishments against racism in soccer more strict.
While campaigns for raising awareness and discussions against racism on the field have intensified in the past few years in Europe, the subject is rarely addressed inside soccer stadiums in Brazil.
In the video, Zé Roberto, the tricolor team's midfielder, former player on Brazil's national team, tells how he was never a victim of racism on the field, but before becoming a successful player, he was discriminated against during an interview because of his skin color.
Defensive midfielder Matheus Biteco recalls an incident from his childhood, when a supermarket security guard tackled him, his father, and his brother Guilherme, also a player on the team.
The team's campaign made the rounds on social networks with the hashtag #azulpretoebranco (meaning blue, black and white, in reference to the team's colors).

Tessa Houghton shares the findings of a study which monitored media bias in Malaysia during the 13th General Elections a few months ago:
Malaysian citizens who relied on English and Bahasa Malaysia newspapers and/or television as their media source/s during the GE13 campaign were not provided with fair and accurate information with which to construct informed voting preferences, with clear voting patterns emerging along these strata of info-communicative diversity and scarcity, and the media used more as a tool of division than of reconciliation.
The destruction of at least 11 mosques in the last two months in Angola is provoking reactions of outrage online.
The Minister of Culture, Rosa Cruz e Silva, said that a law related to liberty of religious assembly should be revised "as a way of fighting 'vigorously' the coming up of new religious congregation whose religious assembly are contrary to our habits and customs to Angolan culture." The destruction (...) must be immediately stopped and we demand an apology from the President of Angola to muslims around the world. If not, then we would like to invite the Islam community to protest peacefully in front of the buildings of Angolan embassies around the world.
Workers who cut sugarcane and other crops in the coastal lowlands of Central America are being hit by a mysterious disease:
From Panama to southern Mexico, laborers are coming down with kidney failure at rates unseen virtually anywhere else in the world.
Families and villages are being devastated by the loss of nearly entire generations of men.
Since 2000, chronic kidney disease has killed more than 24,000 people in El Salvador and Nicaragua, the two countries that are by far the worst-hit by the disease.
Rigorous scientific investigation has only just begun in the communities hit by the epidemic, and relatively few facts have been established, but scientists are coming up with what they believe to be a credible hypothesis.
They say the roots of the epidemic appear to lie in the grueling nature of the work performed by its victims.
Esteban Félix, a Peruvian photographer from the Associated Press, documented the effect of the epidemic in Chichigalpa, Nicaragua, one of the most affected communities.
Thanks to his work, Félix received the Gabriel García Marquez Prize for Journalism this year in the Journalistic Image category.
In this video, edited by Alba Mora (@albamoraroca) with music by Dan Bality, Félix tells the stories behind the photos that he took during his stay at Chichigalpa.
In his own words, Félix summarizes:
Some people work to live, but here, people work to die.

Steve Sharra explains why Malawians should brace for more cash-gate scandal after revelations that some powerful Malawians abused the Integrated Financial Management System internal controls to loot billions of public funds:
Social inequality is creating deep rifts among Malawians, a ticking time bomb.
The increasing incidents of mass violence and vandalism we are witnessing across the country daily are but a tiny ripple in the sea of resentment resulting from this inequality.
That is made more complicated by how our political parties have no established means of raising funds for their very survival, rendering the entire political arena a charade and a get-rich-quick scheme.
Unless we address the fundamental causes of the deep inequality ripping Malawian society apart, we should brace ourselves for more cashgates.

Also see Haiyan Devastates the Philippines, our special coverage page. Six days have passed since super typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) hit the central part of the Philippines but relief is not yet given to many survivors.
Many dead bodies are still lying in the streets, refugees are begging for food, and rescue efforts are not reaching other remote islands of typhoon-ravaged provinces in the Visayas.
Haiyan caused a tsunami-like storm surge which killed thousands in an instant.
The provinces of Leyte and Samar are among the most badly-hit areas with many villages reduced into wasteland.
According to the latest official report, more than 2,000 have died but the casualties could be higher because many dead bodies have yet to be retrieved.
The frustration about the seemingly slow response of the government is reflected on social media:
Overflowing of help & support from ordinary people.

While Tacloban is considered the ‘ground zero’ of the disaster, other islands have been devastated as well and the situation there has not been adequately reported.
Ayi Hernandez visited Capiz province and shares his observations:
Houses made of light materials was either flattened on the ground or was heavily damaged.
Houses made of concrete materials survived the force but lost their rooof partially or totally.
The damages were a bit distrubing when we entered the municipality of Ivisan.
Some families were setting up tents in the highway and maybe because most of the houses were made of light materials, the sight was heartbreaking.
With this kind of destruction, what kept us surprised was the seemingly absence of relief operation in those municipalities.
There is no help flowing in.
Below are some photos in Samar, the province which was first hit by typhoon Haiyan:
Ruffy Biazon, a government official, writes what he thinks should be done soon: While the relief operations are ongoing and everyone is pitching in to lend a helping hand, there should be someone stepping back, taking a look at what has happened and study what went wrong, what should have been done and what to do to prevent the preventable, prepare for the inevitable and provide resources for the doable.
This should be done at the national level and most importantly, at the local level

World Science Forum
The World Science Forum (WSF) gathers hundreds of scientists from all around the world this week in Brazil, to discuss their role in the 21st century and to emphasize the importance of scientific advice in political and economical decisions.
Brazil has hosted several events to discuss poverty eradication and sustainable development from the perspective of different social groups, occasionally antagonistic, such as Rio +20, the People's Summit and the World Social Forum. Due to the fact that nature does not recognize national borders, scientists see both issues from a global perspective.
Leo Vultus by Murillo Martins for the campaign Run4Run4Lions.
After the collective publication #sobreontem (About Yesterday) in support of the movement that started the protests this past June in São Paulo, Brazilian artists are now coming together for a new cause.
This time, their artwork is against lion-killing in Samburu, Kenya.
Natives of the region are using poison and other weapons against lions that are attacking their goats.
To raise the public's awareness of this issue, in 2010 the Ewaso Lions Project organized a half-marathon with the purpose of "neutralizing conflicts between humans and wildlife by involving the local community in the conservation of the lions."
For the organizers, part of the solution to the problem is "more free goats", and that's why at the first event in 2010, the prizes for winning the race were goats.
Now the project is preparing for the next race with the crowdfunding campaign #Run4Run4Lions, which will collect funds for 2014's half-marathon.
The Brazilian artists' original artwork (of which some pieces are already sold out) is offered as compensation for those who support the project.

Guatemalan journalists Carlos Alberto Orellana Chávez was gunned down on Monday, August 19, 2013; he is the fourth journalist killed in Guatemala this year.
In an opinion piece published in Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre, UN's special rapporteur for freedom of expression Frank La Rue denounced "the recent wave of aggressions against journalists in the country," as Alejandro Martínez reports in The Knight Center's Journalism in the Americas blog:
La Rue criticized the administration of President Otto Pérez Molina for failing to stem crime in the country, siding with private interests, persecuting social leaders and not protecting journalists from judicial harassment, lawsuits, threats, physical aggressions and killings.
“Today violence has turned toward the sectors of the press that hold critical positions toward those in power, because of their social function of investigating and informing, but this year's level of aggressions had not been seen in a decade," said La Rue, who described the violence as a "step backwards for democracy and (the country's) peace process."
On 14 September, Tunisian artists Hamzaoui Med Amine and Kafon released their newest song 'Houmani'. With more than 3.4 million views on YouTube so far, the song has become an anthem for Tunisian Youth.
The video clip which only cost 250 dinars (around 150 USD) to produce, depicts residents of a disadvantaged neighborhood as they go through their daily lives.
In the Tunisian dialect, the adjective Houmani derives from the noun Houma, which could be translated to a 'working-class district'.
Houmani refers to someone living in a working class area.
A working class area in Tunisia is called Houma...And rap speaks about these districts inhabited by the poor class, which officials and famous personalities rarely talk about
An Alien listening to Houmani.
Caricature by ZOOart
In the song, Hamzaoui and Kafon describe how life is like for youth living in working-class neighborhoods in Tunisia.
The song lyrics say:
We are living like trash in a garbage can... is suffocating here
Blogger Mehdi Lamloum explains howHoumani has been successful :
Houmani, a simple song with a strange title and a video clip that did not cost much, has generated big debates these recent weeks.The song has quickly blended into the popular culture generating several conversations and debates...The issue of working class neighborhoods vs rich neighborhoods, though not directly tackled in the song, is very present.
A question has been raised regarding this: who has the right to listen to Houmani? Do residents of ‘rich neighborhoods’ have the right to identify themselves with the everyday life recounted by Houmani?
He adds:
Those who criticize the song from a musical perspective are totally right. But, they need to see what is beyond the piece: the work has succeeded in transcribing part of what Tunisians feel, whether they come from poor districts or not and whether they are living the everyday life described in the song or not...
Brazil: Do You Admire Mandela?
A banner paying homage to Nelson Mandela takes on the unanimous popularity of the South-African leader in Brazil to call those who admire his legacy to support human rights.
The message was spread by the non-governmental organization Conectas Human Rights in the International Human Rights Day, 10 December 2013.
Banner publicized by Conectas Human Rights on FacebookTranslation: "Do you also feel moved by his legacy?
Thousands of people around the world suffer with daily violations of human rights.
They need you to do more than to be moved.
Follow his example.
Embrace the cause.
Support human rights.
Here.
Now."
December 10, International Human Rights Day.
Nelson Mandela (1918-2013)
"Do more than being moved" is the appeal of the organization in a country where conservatism and a negative vision about human rights seems to be growing.
As some recent opinion polls show, 90% of Brazilians support the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility, and 61% believe that criminality is caused by people's bad character.
It's not like Caribbean - or global - netizens haven't been preparing themselves for news of Nelson Mandela's death.
The former South African president and anti-apartheid activist was, after all, 95 years old and in poor health, having been hospitalised several times this year for recurring respiratory infections.
Still, the announcement, when it came late yesterday, dealt a hard blow.
Regional bloggers and social media users shared their thoughts about the passing of one of the world's most enduring icons of peaceful resistance.
Bloggers, for the most part, seemed lost for words, preferring - at least for the moment - to share news reports or quote official statements about Mandela's passing.
Guyana's Propaganda Press republished excerpts from President Jacob Zuma's address to the people of South Africa, along with a short biography of Mandela, while The Bajan Reporter posted a tribute to the late president by former Commonwealth Secretary General Sir Shridath Ramphal.
The majority of Caribbean netizens chose to share their reactions on Facebook and Twitter.
Raynier Maharaj, a member of the Trinidadian diaspora and a journalist, commented on Facebook:
OK, if it seems I am dwelling on Mandela's passing, it is because it means a whole lot to me.
He was the epitome of dignity and grace.
Another Trinidadian journalist, Vernon O'Reilly Ramesar, noted:
A testament to his importance that even the US media break into programming to announce the passing of Nelson Mandela.
Facebook user Skye Hernandez was saddened to hear of his death:
I feel strangely sad at the news of Madiba's passing.
He has finally gone to his rest and that is surely a good thing.
But his story and South Africa's have been so inspiring, sometimes so vexing, always riveting.
He's been with us for all of our lives.
Travel well, Nelson Mandela.
Franz Gillezeau suggested that people:
Mourn the man, but remember to celebrate the legend.
Facebook was also filled with newly uploaded photo albums chronicling Mandela's regional visits - this one, courtesy the Jamaica Information Service, of his visit to the island in the early 1990s, and this one, by Amber Media Productions, of his 2004 visit to Trinidad and Tobago.
On flickr, Georgia Popplewell posted a photo of Mandela, noting:
I fear it will be a long time before we see another leader of his calibre again.
Farewell, dear Madiba. #Mandela

Not everyone agreed with this assessment, however. Over at the Cuban diaspora blog babalu, drillanwr wrote:
History will remember his life, to be sure.
While I appreciate and respect Nelson Mandela's struggles and his being a political prisoner within his own country for a large part of his life, I am not unaware of his post-prison political ideology and all the friendships he held with some of the world's nastiest leaders.
In a follow-up post at the same blog, Carlos Eire suggested that:
Mandela's sainthood falls short of universal acclaim, especially among Cubans.
While he dedicated himself to a noble and righteous cause – ending discrimination against black Africans in South Africa – Mandela was not at all opposed to employing violence as a means for his cause.
Worse than that, he expressed nothing but admiration for Fidel Castro and his noxiously racist tyranny, and never stopped singing Fidel’s praises.
In striking contrast, Capitol Hill Cubans shared this perspective:
Nelson Mandela is no longer physically among us, but his legacy of sacrifice, perseverance and freedom will endure forever.
Despite first espousing violence during the early days of his activism, Mandela's life journey demonstrates the transformational power of peaceful, civil disobedience.
His passing is also a reminder of the sacrifice of the world's historic political prisoners, such as Cuba's Eusebio Penalver Mazorra, the longest serving political prisoner of African descent in modern history, having served 28-years.
Sadly, Penalver passed in 2006, without seeing his beloved homeland free.
Along with former Czech leader Vaclav Havel, Mandela is the ultimate representation of a political prisoner-turned-freely elected leader.
From Cuba to North Korea, his extraordinary life gives endless hope to the democratic aspirations of dissidents, political prisoners and activists throughout the world.
Rest in peace and freedom.
Twitter users - world-wide - have been using the hashtags #mandela #death to offer their condolences.
The Caribbean blogosphere will undoubtedly have much more to say about Nelson Mandela and his legacy once the reality of his death sinks in; the GV Caribbean team will provide updates accordingly.

Henri Dumoulin, Global Voices contributor, recalls his stay in Apatou, French Guiana, located in the heart of the Amazon Forest.

Offbeat China introduced a new popular TV program called “Where Are We Going, Dad?”.
The show arranges five celebrity dads and their young kids to fulfill various outdoor tasks in the form of competition without the presence of moms.
Below is one of the netizens' comment quoted by the blogger:
Where Are We Going, Dad?’ becomes a hit show not only because it’s based on a new and interesting idea, but more importantly because it echoes our society’s thirst and expectations of more care and love from dads.
China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo is holding a "hot mom" contest.

Cuban blog Without Evasion says the best way in which she can pay tribute to Nelson Mandela is by "imitating him in forgiveness and reconciliation":
I forgive you...for the friendship with...the vilest dictator my people has ever had...for placing your hand –redemptive for your people- on the bloodied shoulders of the one who excludes and reviles mine.

Mandela spent 27 years in jail for his struggle against South Africa's system of racial segregation known as apartheid.
Freed from prison in 1990, he became president four years later, and left office after serving only one term, a rare gesture in African politics.
The internationally beloved statesman had an impressive way with words.
One of his most famous quotes comes from a defiant speech he made in court during his Rivonia treason trial in 1964, in which he said:
I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.
But, if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
Apart from his Rivonia trial speech, Mandela leaves behind many memorable and wise quotes made throughout his life.
Despite his passing, he continues to speak to the world through Twitter users, who have reacted to news of his death by sharing his words.

Following the crisis that has engulfed the world's newest nation, South Sudan, since December 16, 2013, South Sudanese and friends of the South Sudanese people have created the hashtags #MyTribeIsSouthSudan and #iChoosePeace to call for peace and unity in the country.
South Sudan became independent on July 9, 2011 after a referendum that was held on possible independence from Sudan was approved.

Typhoon Haiyan, a short film by Janssen Powers, documents the aftermath of the super storm that in early November killed more than 6,000 people in the Philippine province of Leyte.
"Naturally, I intended to capture a story of destruction," Powers wrote in the description of his work.
"What I found however, was a story of resilience."
In the documentary, images of the disaster alternate with interviews to the survivors, who talk about the tragedy and their look towards the future.

Bhutan has been blessed with a sustained, rich cultural heritage and the Bhutanese people take pride in upholding a number of essential values including harmony, compassion and patriotism.
Blogger Dorji Wangchuk has been working with the recovering addicts and alcoholics and looks for a long-term solution of the problem among the Bhutanese youth.
He asserts that educating own children is not enough, there is a need to work extra hard towards fostering the children of fellow citizens to inspire them to become good human beings.

Jeremiah from Jotting in the Granite Studio comments on the China's state broadcaster CCTV's attempt to draw the link between Mandela and Mao Zedong:
Mandela didn’t really have much in common with Mao.
Mao was an idealist in the strictest sense of the word, a man who believed that how you did something mattered more than the results, often with disastrous consequences.
During his long career, Mandela always kept his eyes on the prize.
He repeatedly showed a willingness to compromise tactics to realize his dream of equality in South Africa.
Being a street vendor is not an easy job, especially in Senegal.
Yet this is the choice that Sebastian Prothmann, a native of Germany, made after he arrived in Dakar, Senegal a few months ago. The following video shows Prothmann at work :
At the beginning of my stay (in Senegal), I met a young man who at our first meeting expressed his longing to leave Senegal. I wanted to understand why he wanted to leave and how his everyday life was so I could comprehend the socio-cultural interpretations of his desire to leave.
He was a peddler.
So one day I asked if I could accompany him in his daily routine hhich he accepted.
After he made ​​me do a round as a vendor, supposedly for my training.
He was glad because he made some good profits With this new work, I had a better understanding of the informal sector here, commonly known as "door waar " which plays a fundamental role in the lives of Senegalese youth .
I was often faced with disbelief when it came to my origins.
Most people did not believe that a white man can get involved in such work here.
Several times I was also granted more trust about my products than the other street vendors.
There was a prevailing line of thinking that suggested that a white person must be selling good quality products .
Marginalized Egyptians with special needs have been protesting for their rights both before and since the #Jan25 revolution.
However, their grievances are yet to be resolved.
At the time when the Committee of 50 is voting on the most recent draft of the Egyptian Constitution, Zayee Zayak campaign, which translates to "I am just like you" from Egyptian colloquial Arabic, has kicked off in Egypt aiming at raising awareness about the constitutional rights of people with special needs in the country.
A 2006 census claimed that almost a million Egyptians suffered some sort of disability, yet dedicated NGOs and international organizations estimate these to be at least 8.5 million.
Zayee Zayak campaigners evaluate that as many as 17 million Egyptians have special needs:

Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — When it comes to football rivalries, few in Africa are more intense than the one between Simba Sports Club and Young Africans (known locally as Yanga).
Both from the country’s commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, they are the two biggest and oldest clubs in Tanzania.
They have won the the greatest number of titles, boast the biggest fan bases, and in their squads you will find the best collection of talent in the nation.
When these two clubs meet, Dar es Salaam is transformed.
A certain electricity courses through the city.
It’s subtle, but the energy shift is palpable, with Dar’s famous edginess rising a few notches.
Tanzania has long prided itself on its unassailable unity.
We are Tanzanians first, before any ethnic, religious or tribal affiliation.
But on the day of the Dar es Salaam Derby, the city cleaves into two distinct clans.
People don either Simba SC's famous red and white or Yanga's yellow and green.
Street corners sprout flagpoles carrying the teams' logos, marking a neighbourhood's affiliation.
Cars fly banners signaling their drivers’ allegiance.
The flag with the majestic lion is Simba; the torch superimposed on a map of Africa is Yanga.
On match day, there is no such thing in Dar as a neutral.
I Bleed Red
I am a Simba fan.
Always have been and always will be.
My connection to the club runs deep.
My father, Mohammed Hadi Tamimi, played for the club in the late 60s and early 70s, when it was known as Sunderland.
And as a boy, I would wake up on the day of the Derby, don my Simba kit and my uncles would carry me on their shoulders to the game.
"One day, everyone will be Simba SC's supporter."

My memory of those afternoons is filled with heartache.
I remember mostly the defeats, and the sense of despair that followed.
One player in particular was a thorn in Simba's side.
Said Sued “Scud” played for Yanga in the 90s and his specialty was scoring against Simba.
He was slightly overweight and didn't play that much, but when the Derby came around it was almost inevitable that he would score the winner, with a thunderous strike befitting the nickname “Scud”.
As I’ve grown older, my devotion to Simba has waned somewhat.
In the last ten years I attended no more than three Dar Derbies.
But recently I started monitoring my old team's progress again and last Sunday, after a long hiatus, I decided to go and watch the latest meeting between the old arch-rivals.
A Classic For The Ages
I arrived, with some friends, at the fantastic, 60,000-capacity Benjamin William Mkapa National Stadium about an hour before the 4pm kick-off.
The atmosphere was already electric, with the two sets of fans trying to out-sing each other.
A pre-game match between the club's youth teams was underway.
As I took my seat, I felt the sense of anxiety start to build.
Simba was coming into the game the more in-form team.
Still unbeaten and leading the league, they had won five of their last eight games.
Yanga, on the other hand, had already suffered their first defeat of the season, but with four wins and three draws, they were in fourth position, only three points behind the league leaders.

But as the game kicked off, it was Yanga who came out of the gate in blistering form.
They handled the ball with pace and fluency and controlled the tempo throughout the first half.
Simba seemed unsure of themselves, with no clear idea of what their tactics should be.
They were lethargic, struggled to keep possession, resorting instead to long balls that inevitably led to them giving the ball away, which put them on the defensive.
The star of the first half was undoubtedly Yanga's number 10, Mrisho Ngasa.
A former Simba player, he was causing his former club all sorts of problems.
Playing in the pocket, between the midfield and attack, his movements off the ball wreaked havoc on the heart of Simba's defence.
When he had the ball his pace simply terrorised Simba's back four.
15 minutes into the game, he was rewarded for his efforts.
A ball swung in from the left, eluded Simba's defender and broke into Ngasa's path. Ngasa flicked it into the net to give Yanga a well deserved lead.

Things got even better for Yanga in the 35th minute.
After Simba failed to clear a long throw into their six-yard box, Yanga’s Hamid Kiiza pounced, to give his team a 2-0 lead.
And just before half-time, Yanga scored again.
After an errant pass was intercepted, midfielder Didier Kavumbangu dribbled past a Simba defender before setting up Kiiza, who slotted in his second goal of the game.
3-0, Yanga.
It was shaping up to be a massacre.
Simba had no idea of what hit them.
When the referee blew his whistle for half-time, the players seemed relieved.
Their fans were shell-shocked.
Some decided they had seen enough and left the stadium.
Those who did were about to miss one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the Dar Derby.
Soon after the start of the second half Simba made two changes.
Midfielders William Lucian and Said Ndemla came in for the underwhelming Haroun Chanongo and Abdulhalim Humuod.
The two young substitutes quickly transformed the match.
All of a sudden Simba's midfield, out-run, out-hustled and out-played in the first half, grabbed control of the game.
Lucian and Ndemla, in particular, injected some pace into Simba's attacks and soon enough they had helped their team pull a goal back.
Then, in the 54th minute, Yanga failed to deal with a speculative punt forward from Simba that found striker Bertram Mombeki in position to blast the ball into the roof of the net, giving his side some hope.
A few minutes later a corner kick swung in by Ramadhan Singano was headed powerfully into the net by the Ugandan centre-back Joseph Owino and all of a sudden it was 3-2, and we had a game on our hands.
Yanga’s fans appeared deflated and anxious while Simba's began believing that a comeback might be in store.
The noise in the stadium was deafening, with the cries of “Let's go, Simba!”
But Yanga weren’t done yet.
Ngasa, quieter in the second half, went through clean on goal at one point, but his tame shot was parried away by Simba's goalkeeper, Abel Dhaira.
Ngasa was to rue that missed chance.
Five minutes from the end of the match, Simba got a free-kick on the right wing, near the edge of Yanga's box.
The resulting cross was met beautifully by Gilbert Kaze, who headed in the equalizer, sending the red and white half of the stadium into a frenzy.
Simba’s comeback was complete.
Final Score in the Dar Derby.

It was a stunning turnaround, the first time in the history of the Derby that a team had been able to accomplish such a feat.
The match ended 3-3.
A few minutes later, after the referee had blown for full time, some Simba players collapsed to the ground, not quite believing what they had just pulled off.
Those who could manage to stand embraced their opponents, taking in the idea that they’d just been part of an unforgettable classic, one that will long live in the memory of their fans.

The Legislative Yuan in Taiwan passed the first reading of the "marriage equality“ bill on Oct 25, 2013.
On Nov 30, more than 300000 people protested against this bill, in particular against the proposal on same-sex marriage.
J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based freelance journalist, described what he observed in this protest in his blog.
In the last 20 years, 670 journalists have been killed in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to delegates from the IFEX-ACL alliance, which recently presented their Annual Report on Impunity 2013: "Faces and Traces of Freedom of Expression in Latin America and the Caribbean."
Silvia Higuera summarizes the report in the Knight Center's Journalism in the Americas Blog.
She adds:
According to the report, Latin America is going through a crucial moment for freedom of expression.
Depending on the place, journalists face threats from criminal groups or institutional weaknesses.
Many countries are also going through controversial legal processes that could limit freedom of the press.
"Stop the Raids" Roma protest in Paris - photo by Philippe Leroyer - creative commons license 3.0
The statement from the interior minister of France Manuel Valls gave new life to the tense relationship of France with the Roma community.
Mr Valls said on France Inter radio on September 24 :
This community has a way of life that is very different from ours and their way is clearly at odds with the way of life of their neighbors.
The statement got plenty of reactions from the francophone community on twitter, some with a hint of sarcasm :
Roma people are the reasons for all of our misfortunes. It's because of them that more than 25% of youngsters in Europe are unemployed.
These families are caught between a rock and hard place: a declining Europe that rejects them and the mob that is getting richer
On a subject that was already quite sensitive for Human rights in France, the Minister's statement got him a warning from the Council of Europe:
This debate is taking a worrisome path towards a narrative hostile and discriminatory towards the Roma community.
It might also take a turn for the worse during the next European parliamentary and municipal elections.

An Andy Warhol version of a young Moscow Metro gunman.
Anonymous image distributed online.
The incident was caught on the train's CCTV camera.
On the video a man is seen approaching two seated passengers and after after a brief exchange, one of these men stands up, takes out an air or gas powered rubber-bullet pistol and shoots the first man in the face at point-blank range.
His companion, a younger man, also pulls out a gun and keeps it trained on the injured man, as the two exit the carriage.
The video was acquired by the tabloid LifeNews, and has since spread widely on the RuNet.
The shooting victim was Hashim Latipov, a Dagestani, while the two men that shot him, seemingly for no reason, looked to be ethnic Russians.
And although Latipov says that the altercation was unprovoked from his side, the fact of his ethnicity was enough for Russian nationalists to assume that the two Russian men were acting in self-defense.
The vigilante crime-fighter angle (never mind that it has no basis) is being actively promoted by images like the one below, where the two shooters have been photoshopped into a poster of the movie "Boondock Saints."

Reforms to the educational system were suspended in Gabon after teachers and students marched together in protests.
In the proposed reform, the final exam to obtain the high school diploma will be done in one round instead of two and the entry into high school will be subjected to a final exam instead of a passing grade at the end of the final year of middle high school.
Charlie M. explains what was at stake :
By acting spontaneously without waiting for a go ahead word from anyone, young students demonstrated that they were capable on their own, to realize that to deal with the situation, it was necessary for them to intervene and mobilize.
Nobody would do it in their place; especially not their elders who are not capable of that.
The youth, unlike their seniors, understand better that democrats, regardless of their views, cannot accept that their rights be violated, and therefore cannot yield when it comes to these fundamental issues such as the right to a quality education

Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa who played a crucial role in that country's dismantling of apartheid, died on Thursday, December 5, 2013 at the age of 95.
The beloved statesman and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is often referred to as Madiba, spent 27 years in prison for his political activities during the country's white minority rule before becoming president.
Since the news of his death broke, Nigerians have been celebrating the life and times of the man some call Africa's greatest gift to humanity.
Within the African world view, the departure of a sage is no time for mourning, but a time of reflection on and appreciation of a worthy legacy.
Eulogies have continued to stream in on Nigerian social media since the announcement of his death.

Neon lights cast upon the world a cast of

Coup Attempt?
Ethnic Conflict?
Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, the world's newest nation, said on December 16, 2013 that an attempted coup by soldiers loyal to former vice-president Riek Machar had been put down.
Riek Machar has refuted the allegations, saying that the fighting was a result of a conflict between members of the presidential guard.
Machar was the African country's first vice-president before president Kiir fired him July 2013.
About 500 civilians are reported to have been killed since the crisis began.
Was there a coup on December 16?
Is the crisis in the country an ethnic conflict?

What would be the reasons for president Kiir's attempt to blame his former vice president?
Lesley Anne Warner, an African security analyst, explains:
Political tensions had been on the rise since President Kiir sacked his entire cabinet in July, especially his VP Riek Machar, whose location at the moment, is unconfirmed.
(I’m trying to get the #WhereIsRiek hashtag started, but sadly it hasn’t gained traction.)
Salva was quick to point the finger at Riek to blame him for the recent unrest, but my initial sense is that Riek has spent years trying to rehabilitate his reputation from the 1991 Nasir coup attempt and would be more likely to exhaust his options in the political sphere before resorting to armed violence.
The key issue to consider is who stands to gain from casting Riek in a negative light and reminding South Sudan, and the international community, of his past?
The answer is, President Kiir, who needs to bolster his own image as South Sudan’s leader in light of the cabinet reshuffle, and in the run-up to elections in 2015.
Notice how President Kiir has donned his military apparel, which he hasn’t worn in years for the press conference he gave on yesterday’s events instead of his trademark cowboy hat.
Is the crisis a power struggle between two ethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer?
President Kiir comes from the majority Dinka people and Machar from the Nuer.
South Sudanese bloggger PaanLuel Wël does not think so:
Deadly shoot-outs among the presidential guards in Juba is being portrayed as a war pitting the Dinka (among whom President Kiir is from) against the Nuer, the tribe of Dr. Riek Machar, South Sudan former Vice President.
Yet, the senior SPLM officials being arrested are overwhelmingly Dinkas – both from Bor and Bahr el Ghazal.
And even Equatorians and Shilluks.
So, what is the what?
South Sudanese should sort out the mess among the Presidential Guards and must leave out these two–tribalization of the unfortunate incident and victimization of innocent political opponents.
Wël also imagines possible end scenarios to the crisis:
Barring the tragedy of the situation, it is amusing how the government is conducting the aftermath of the mutiny – making it appear as a resounding victory rather than the beginning of a tragedy awaiting the nation.
One thing is clear: there is no end to this crisis other than some kind of mediated compromise between President Kiir and Riek Machar.
Riek Machar will come back to Juba as the 1st Vice President of South Sudan, and possibly with a clause making him unfirable by Kiir.
If that is the case, then won’t it make more sense to initiate the dialogue and peaceful end to the crisis RIGHT NOW rather than waiting for more precious lives to be lost on both sides before the two camps settle for what it is that it is.
Martin Garang thinks the crisis was either a coup or mishandling reassignments on the part of security forces:
Civilians have so far become the underdogs caught in the crossfire, targeted for no reason or locked in their homes without food or water in Juba.
Reports have hinted that the Jonglee capital of Bor had come under heavy gunfire with several deaths reported.
Either it was a coup d'état or security forces mishandling reassignments in their quarters, The SPLM has tarnished its reputation by putting innocent lives at risk.
Whatever the truth in the recent government rhetoric, the rhyme and whine over state power from the leaders carry the blame for the current state of affairs in Juba.
South Sudan has a history of rebellions which had been made excessively ethnical during the decades of war of independence.
It is a reality that can be seen in all aspects of life in the country.
It’s therefore the responsibility of the SPLM leadership to have acquainted itself with this reality by urging leaders to refrain from using ethnic cards in their power manipulations.
Writing on African Arguments, Jairo Munive, a post-doctoral researcher at the Peace, Risk and Violence Unit- Danish Institute for International Studies, points out that what happened in South Sudan is probably not a coup:
But are we witnessing a coup in South Sudan?
Probably not.
First, one should forget, or at least treat with caution, the wording employed by the actors involved the crisis.
President Kiir has spoken of a “coup attempt” and “criminal actions” whilst Machar refers to the “manufacturing of a coup plot to launch a crackdown against the opposition…the country is to be united and cannot tolerate one man’s rule or it cannot tolerate dictatorship”.
It is more fruitful instead to think about the apparent collapse in cohesion of SPLA.
The real issue at this juncture, as the head of the United Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Hilda Johnson expressed, is the discipline, command and control in the security forces.
To come to terms with recent events we have to understand the SPLA – its politics, tensions and drama surrounding it.
South Sudanese politics is interwoven with low intensity warfare, inter-ethnic violence and norms of authority grounded in violence.
This violence is designed to generate loyalty, fear and legitimacy within a region or an ethnic group vis-à-vis those in power.
The army in South Sudan has a tremendous importance in two ways: both as a space for politics and as a ‘welfare provider’ within the nascent state.
Furthermore, the make-up of the army reflects the divided politics of the country.
The political environment in South Sudan, as the events of this week testify, remains vulnerable to the mobilisation of armed force.
Internal factionalism and defections have marked the SPLA in recent years.
Commanders, particularly those from other armed groups integrated into the SPLA (particularly from the SSDF), have reacted to a perceived lack of integration and authority, power and military command.

Photo from Facebook page of Elephant Conservation CenterLaos was once called the ‘land of a million elephants’ but today elephant population has been reduced to several hundreds because of poaching and illegal ivory trade.
Some are dying because of overwork in logging areas.
It is estimated that wild elephants number around 300 to 600:
Scattered in small fragmented herds, population numbers of wild elephants are believed to be around 300-600.
Like many other countries, wild elephants in Laos are threatened by problems caused by humans.
This includes deforestation, poaching, expansion of human settlement and human-elephant conflict.
Meanwhile, there are around 420 captive elephants:
Sadly captive elephant populations are in decline.
Only an approximate 420 remain in Laos.
The new millennium has bought with it the burden of financial gain, with mahouts (elephant owner) having to work their elephants seven days a week to earn a living.
Elephants are mainly employed in the logging industry, a very hard and dangerous job.
Male elephants are too tired and busy to reproduce and can even die from logging accidents.
Fortunately, there is a growing awareness about the need to protect the elephants in the country.
One of the groups spearheading this advocacy is the Elephant Conservation Center:
Elephant Conservation Center differentiates itself from elephant tourist camps by being a haven for elephant reproduction, lactation, convalescence and disease diagnosis.
Do NOT expect to see package tours riding these elephants all day long!
It is also the first elephant hospital in Laos as well as serving as an ecotourism camp.
It provides technical and livelihood assistance to elephant owners or mahout who depend on the elephants for their daily income.
The center is also a sanctuary for rescued elephants.
They were able to rescue a young elephant which they named Noy.
After a few years, the elephant will pick his new name through a process described by head veterinarian Emmanuelle Chave:
At three years old, elephants are trained by their future mahout, to respond different cues, in order to work with humans.
A shaman organizes this important journey, where the elephant leaves the forest world for the human world.
At the end of the training, the young elephant is offered three sugarcanes, on which are written names.
The name on the first sugarcane he picks up will be his.
Brita visited the center and recognized its role in protecting the welfare of elephants:
The Elephant Conservation Center is probably one of the few places you can visit where it’s not about elephants adapting to people’s schedules and needs but where people adapt to the rhythm and needs of the elephants I am very picky when it comes to choosing an Elephant “place” as there are far too many all over the world which treat their elephants badly and which just means moving from one horrible life (=logging) to another (= bad treatment for tourism purposes).
jo ebisujima also visited the center and learned that putting chairs on the back of an elephant is painful for the animal:
One of the important things that were learnt was that the chairs that are used for carry people and luggage on an elephants back (hawdah) really isn't good for them.
This is due to the shape of the bones...It is more comfortable for the elephant to be ridden without any kind of saddle and sat on their neck.

Only two decades ago, the status of many women in some South Asian countries was low. Many girls in rural areas were not allowed to study.
Girls were inevitably married off as soon as they grew up, so what good was studying?
Boys would get the best of the households' food, the girls the leftovers. But this discriminatory mindset has changed tremendously, in part thanks to a cartoon character.
The fictional character Meena stars in the South Asian children's television show of the same name.
Promoted by UNICEF, Meena and her TV show is very popular in the region.
UNICEF developed the Meena Communication Initiative (MCI) as a mass communication project aimed at changing perceptions and behavior that hamper the survival, protection and development of girls in South Asia.
Bangladesh was the first country to meet Meena when a film about her struggle to go to school aired on Bangladesh national television (BTV) in 1993.
The secondary characters of her stories include Meena's brother Raju and her pet parrot Mithu.
Meet Meena.

According to an old report of UNICEF:
Since her inception 14 years ago she has shown millions of women and girls what can be achieved.
She has delivered messages on issues as far reaching as solving the problem of bullying through to challenging the stigma of HIV/AIDS through to girls' right to play sport.
The Meena stories are highly entertaining and fun, but also reflect, at their core, the realities of girls' lives in South Asia.
Meena has spread messages to stop child marriage and the practice of dowry and promote healthy toilet use, sending girls to school, equality between boys and girls and the right to education for the domestic workers.
Her shows highlights the potential contributions to society that girls can make if provided an equal playing field.
How can a message spread by a small cartoon girl be so empowering that it has helped change the society radically?
Housewife Naznin Rahman told the Daily Prothom Alo :
My mom Zohra Begum has taken dowry for her two elder sons.
In those days, Meena was not aired.
Since she started watching Meena, she had developed a special sympathy for girls in particular.
When she had her younger son married, we realized how she was affected by Meena.
She did not take any dowry for my younger brother.
Shuvo Ankur wrote on the BDNews24.com's kids page about the positive changes Meena has provoked:
Meena achieved popularity from the start.
The changes were visible soon after.
Earlier, in rural areas girl students dropped out of school and ended up working as a housemaid.
But the situation changed after Meena's show began airing.
On screen, Meena was also not allowed to go to school first.
But she changed her lot and got permission to go to school.
Meena's wit and intelligence allowed her to learn to count and other essential knowledge to save her father from the deception from other people. She saved their cows from a thief.
Her intelligence became popular, and the negligence of girls in South Asian countries slowly started disappearing.
Sohanur Rahman wrote on Kishorebarta that there is a lot to learn from the cartoon show:
We have learnt a lot from Meena.
From the '90s till today, Meena has become a star and a special character in our society.
Meena is also broadcast on radio.
Farzana Islam Tithi, 24, who voices Meena, told The Daily Star:
Everyone loved Meena from their childhood and everyone, regardless of age, watched the cartoon eagerly.
I also used to watch it.
May be Meena’s accent struck to my mind since then and I believe that feeling helped me in my voice over for Meena.
Twitter user Bengalithings deemed Meena a role model:
To be honest, Meena from Meena cartoon was one of my childhood role models. #nosarcasm #truth #bengali — PerksOfBeingBengali♡ (@bengalithingss) October 24, 2013
The UNICEF Bangladesh Twitter account (@UNICEFBD) reminded that:
Animation character Meena continues to influence lives of children and dispel negative social stereotypes... http://t.co/h5mbXHr64Y — UNICEF Bangladesh (@UNICEFBD) December 24, 2013
Every year on 24th October "Meena Day" is observed in Bangladesh to promote social awareness on 100% enrollment of kids in school, avoid dropouts and ensure proper education.
According to reports , Meena has also become popular outside of the South Asian region.
It has been dubbed in more than 30 languages such as Arabic, Burmese and Chinese.

Is South Korea government gearing up toward social media censorship?
The latest official remark by President Park (full transcript ) had Korean net users worried.
Park, addressing "those rumors spreading via social media", said "if the government let these things happen, it will bring chaos nationwide" and added "bear in mind that the authorities need to react fast and aggressively, and preemptively against those groups trying to distort the situations".
Many twitter users voiced concerns and pointed out the fact (such as @ppsskr's tweet which has been retweeted over 500 times) that the government bodies sent out over 24 million tweets to tip the scale in favor of Park in the latest presidential election.

Both Venezuela and Haiti have been facing anti-government protests.
However, the international media’s escalation of the Venezuelan crisis and their complete silence when it comes to Haiti, raises some important questions about the United States’ inconsistency in upholding the values of human rights and democracy.
Kevin Edmonds calls out the mainstream media.
This post is part of our Special Coverage Ukraine's #Euromaidan Protests.
Protests in Ukraine escalated to a deadly stand-off between hundreds of thousands of citizens and government forces in the evening of February 18.
Roads to the city were blocked by authorities, and the metro in Kyiv were stopped.
The main opposition TV channel reported being taken off air.
Fierce clashes between police and protesters around the main square continued through the night.
On February 19, the Kyiv Post reported that at least 25 people are dead and more than 1,000 are injured.
In the morning of February 18, 2014, Ukraine's opposition tried to register a bill in Parliament to bring back the old version of the country's Constitution, one that significantly limits presidential powers.
The move was backed by the nearly three-months-old Euromaidan movement, which has been protesting daily in several cities throughout Ukraine demanding that the government of President Viktor Yanukovych step down.
Ahead of the session, the protesters marched to the Parliament building.
When the speaker of the parliament refused to register the bill, clashes broke out between the people and the police.
MPs who support President Yanukovych had left the building, while the president himself was nowhere to be found.
Police and special forces then stormed Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independance Square), the protesters' stronghold.

A student in Kyiv, Ukraine tweeted from morning till past midnight on the day of a violent standoff between protesters and police which led to as many as 25 deaths and many hundreds wounded.
On this day, February 18, 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament failed to limit the powers of President Viktor Yanukovych, the main target of the protests that have continued for three months on Maidan Nezalezhnosti .
Below are selected tweets @Mira_mp who witnessed events first-hand as a protester in the square, and eventually as a volunteer at a hospital to help the wounded.
Her first tweets reflect the beginning of the clashes:

The time stamps indicate that it was after the police and special forces started cracking down on protesters near the parliament.
We are going to a hospital.
Two of my dad's friends have serious injuries - to the head and arm. this revolution is turning into a war.
There were concerns that police might arrest those who report injuries, and she tweeted:
Maybe we should not got to a hospital.
Just stop by a pharmacy, treat their wounds and get them home.
Later on, she returned to Maidan to follow events in the parliament.
Now we are back to Maidan.

López, the leader of the Voluntad Popular party, had an arrest warrant that was issued against him by a court in Caracas for allegedly being responsible for crimes related to the protests taking place in Venezuela.
Dear International Editor:
Listen and understand.
The game changed in Venezuela last night.
What had been a slow-motion unravelling that had stretched out over many years went kinetic all of a sudden.
What we have this morning is no longer the Venezuela story you thought you understood.
In the blog Caracas Chronicles Francisco Toro reacts to the lack of media coverage about the escalating violence and the events on February 19.
He concludes:
The level of disengagement on display is deeply shocking.
Venezuela’s domestic media blackout is joined by a parallel international blackout, one born not of censorship but of disinterest and inertia.
It’s hard to express the sense of helplessness you get looking through these pages and finding nothing.
Venezuela burns; nobody cares.
Let me put this clearly.
Y’all need to step it up.
The time to discard what you thought you knew about the way things work in Venezuela is now.
You can check out our special coverage page about the protests in Venezuela here.
A full month since President-elect Hery Rajaonarimampianina took position as the new head of state in Madagascar, there are still no indication who the new prime minister will be and what government he/she will assemble.
Ma-Laza argues that the main issue is not really the identity of the prime minister but what he/she will bring to the table :
(The prime minister should be) a person with outstanding technical know-how, a uniter who is able to carry out the policy of the President of the Republic.
In theory, the Prime Minister should not belong to any political movement.
He will not be against Rajoelina, nor against Ravalomanana (the two last presidents).
In short, he will have to be that rare person who will inspire the trust of the investors.
The question is: does this person even exist?
Venezuela is going through an economic, political and social crisis which brought about thousands of citizens taking the streets to express their discontent.
For more than a week, Venezuelans have been involved in mass protests that, until now, have caused eight deaths, hundreds of injuries and hundreds of arrests.
In this edition of GV Face, our Latin America editor Silvia Viñas and I talk to Global Voices author and digital rights lawyer Marianne Díaz Hernández who has been tracking citizen media and web censorship amidst a government-imposed media blackout in Venezuela.
Marianne talks about everyday life in Venezuela - how shortages of food and medicine affect people, and how newspapers in the country have been reduced to as few as four pages because of lack of paper.
She recommends alternative online news sources that focus on fact-checking, including Elperiodistacivico.com, at a moment when disinformation and propaganda is confounding those trying to make sense of events.
It has been called South Korea's "greatest export."
PSY's K-pop song Gangnam style is the most watched video on YouTube.
But behind the glamorous facades and big paychecks, it's not all fun and romance until South Korea's censors have done their work.

Yoo Eun is also the creator of the website K-pop Decoder.
We ask her what she thinks makes K-pop special?
What has the impact of K-pop been on culture, fashion and music in South Korea?
And whether she thinks K-pop's global success would have been possible without social media and YouTube.

Maldivian blogger Hani Amir writes about the traditional fishing methods of the reef fishermen of Maldives which include catching tons of fish with their hands, instead of nets or rods.

His name is Djamel Ghanem, and he's a young Algerian cartoonist.
His job is no fun in a country where censorship and prosecution await those who dare to speak their minds.
Ghanem faces 18 months in prison for an unpublished caricature of Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that was deemed offensive by the authorities.
Djamel Ghanem via Algérie Focus.
Used with permission
In fact, President Bouteflika is not represented or even directly mentioned in the unpublished cartoon.
The drawing portrays two citizens mocking the fourth term the current president is seeking after ruling Algeria for 15 years.
The caricature compares the fourth mandate to baby diapers.
With the drawing, Ghanem wanted to convey the idea that Algerians are treated like children.
For that, he was taken to court and threatened with imprisonment.
The district attorney of Oran, the second largest city in Algeria, located 400 kilometers northwest of the capital Algiers, wanted the cartoonist to admit that he had the intention of insulting the president.
But Ghanem categorically denied that he had such intention.
Neither Bouteflika nor his advisers filed the suit against Ghanem.
It was Ghanem's former employer, La Voix de l'Oranie (Voice of Oran), a daily newspaper known for its pro-regime editorial line, who sued him for the cartoon which was never published in the media.
Sued by his own newspaper, Ghanem saw all the doors of Algerian media closing in his face.
Interviewed by Algerie-Focus, Ghanem explained that he has had difficulties finding a lawyer to defend his cause along with other challenges:
the director of another newspaper was advised to not hire me.
I became persona non-grata. Through me, they want to thwart the opposition who is fighting against a fourth term for the president.
After the case's first hearing, the judges requested an 18-month prison sentence against Ghanem.
The final ruling is expected next month on March 4.
Meanwhile, netizens are voicing their support for and solidarity with Ghanem.
An online petition demands that Ghanem be let go:
If the media and the opinion keep quiet on this infringement of freedom of expression and the violation of a citizen's rights, then tomorrow any court can charge a journalist for criticizing the president of the republic, an army official, a minister or a deputy.
With this petition, we demand an end to the prosecution against Djamel Ghanem.
By shielding the president against any criticism, the administration is trying to impose a totalitarian ideology upon its citizens.
Freedom of expression is at risk in Algeria.
Ghanem's case is a typical example of how dire the situation is for cartoonists and other people willing to speak up.
Interim president Adly Mansour issued a presidential decree promoting General Abdel Fattah El-Sissi, minister of defence, to the rank of field marshal.
It is the highest rank in the Egyptian military.
The promotion has created a buzz online, with many wondering whether it paves the way for Sissi to run for presidency in elections penciled in for the end of April.
Adam Makary tweets:
Reminder - Sisi was #Egypt's first defence minister not to hold the top rank of Field Marshal.
Louisa Loveluck notes:
And Ahmed Abrass explains what the title Field Marshal means :
"Field Marshal in English means someone who has led troops on the field battle and have obtained scintillating victories"
This isn't the case for El Sissi.
However, it seems that this is not a prerequisite in the Egyptian army and that the former general had all the necessary qualifications to become a Field Marshal.
Nervana Mahmoud explains:
Bel Trew confirms:
And Egyptian Streets says:
Many netizens seem puzzled and clearly annoyed by the news.
On Facebook, Mina Labib asks :
What is he being honoured for?
The explosions?
Egypt woke up on January 24 to a series of four explosions, which left six dead and over 70 wounded in Cairo.
Some suggest that this promotion is a fast-track to Sissi's presidential bid.
Nervana Mahmoud writes:
Promotion of general Sisi is a sign of imminent resignation.
Egyptian Streets adds:
BREAKING: Reports indicate Al-Sisi meeting with military leaders to plan his nomination for Presidency, likely to resign. #Egypt — Egyptian Streets (@EgyptianStreets) January 27, 2014 And journalist Patrick Kingsley explains: Just spoke to a senior military source who claimed #Sisi wd have to resign if he ran.
It seems that the presidential bid isn't the only reason for this promotion.
Tarik Salama tweets:
Sisi promoted as Marshal is a salary necessity.
And Basil Al Dabh adds:
While Gr33ndata shares this cartoon:

According to the specialists who treated her at the Dr. Rafael Guerra Méndez Clinic in the city of Valencia, Miss Tourism Carabobo 2013 was hit by the projectile in the right-hand side of the occipital lobe, which hosts the brain's visual centre.
There was speculation that she would have lost her vision even if she had been able to recover.
Genesis Carmona (23) wounded by a bullet at the protest in Valencia comes out of the operating theatre, is now in intensive care.
A Caracas newspaper has published a collection of tweets from the user Héctor Rotunda (@Hecalo), who narrates the events from the moment Génesis Carmona received the gunshot wound until her death.
Rotunda was in the same part of the protest as the late beauty queen.
We were at the march in front of the Cedeño subway station.
We heard a burst of gunfire and threw ourselves to the ground...
On Twitter the reactions of anguish and accusations continue.
The Governor of the State of Carabobo, Francisco Ameliach, has been singled out as the main instigator of the attack on the protest in Valencia.
A few days ago the Governor sent messages over Twitter that the protestors are now using to accuse him of inciting violence .
In the following tweet, for example, he mentions the UBCH , the Bolívar - Chávez Battle Units (Unidades de Batalla Bolívar - Chávez) of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV - Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela), the country's governing party.
UBCH get ready for the forceful counter-attack.
Diosdado will give the order.
Diosdado Cabello is currently President of the National Assembly (Venezuelan Parliament).
Meanwhile the Member of Parliament Francisco Soteldo made a statement to the media asking for justice for the death of Carmona:
Soteldo: "We demand justice for the death of Génesis Carmona"
Thus Carmona has become the fourth fatality in the protests that have been taking place in Venezuela.
One of China's top journalists and TV anchors, Chai Jing, has caused a stir online after she gave birth in the US, with some netizens calling her a "traitor" or a "liberal hypocrisy".
After pictures of Chai holding a newborn baby at an airport were published online, reports surfaced that she had given birth to a daughter in the US in October 2013.
Obviously, the benefit is that the child becomes a US citizen.
A highly respected reporter in China, Chai is known for her sharpness, persistence and her direct, cut-to-the point interview technique.
She made her name for covering the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the Sichuan earthquake in 2008.

Chai giving birth in the US has disappointed a lot of her fans, with many calling her hypocritical.
Netizen “Tan” wrote:
We should understand that these public figures attack or criticize their home country, not because they love this country but one day have the capability to embrace the United States, Europe and other countries.
Which kind of people who criticize this country are more sincere?
Only those who will always be Chinese.
However, a large number of people also expressed their support.
Some were sad about the emigration trend among China’s middle class, calling for reflection among Chinese top leaders:
Very realistic, higher-ups should reflect on why things like this happen.
When thinking about the future, she has the ability to select a country with a more fair, equal and sound system for his child.
It’s not for anyone else to comment on.
If you have the ability, would you become a US citizen?
Think about it and you will understand.
We ourselves cannot change the status quo in this country, we do not have the votes, why can’t we make a change for our children?
It’s Chai Jing’s own freedom and personal matter to decide where her child should be born.
Commentator Liu Xuesong wrote :
Whether one is patriotic or not, the most important thing is not to find out where the child was born, but to see his role as a citizen in this country, and how many good deeds he has done.
Whether if it is worth it to love this country has something to do with the collective consciousness of this country, whether it shows love, harmony, friendliness and generosity and whether it focuses on the prosperity, justice and civilization.
Another netizen wrote :
Some netizens said that she only wants the child to have a more normal lifestyle, which has nothing to do with patriotism.
Perhaps, this is the problem the government should reflect on.
Mexican authorities have confirmed the murder of Gregorio Jiménez de la Cruz, aka “Goyo”.
The lifeless body of Jiménez de la Cruz was found in a clandestine grave on February 11, 2014, according to reports in El Universal and La Jornada.
The electronic version of the weekly Proceso had previously reported the disappearance of the reporter, demanding answers from the authorities.
On Twitter, the hashtag #HastaQueAparezcaGoyo was used to express support for the family and colleagues of Jiménez de la Cruz during the darkest hours.
The journalist Paola Rojas was one of the first to spread the word on Twitter:
The Special Prosecutor of Veracruz has confirmed that journalist Gregorio Jiménez was murdered.
The activist Jesús Robles Maloof asked for the resignation of the governor in Veracruz, where Gregorio Jiménez de la Cruz practiced his profession as a journalist:
It's time that Javier Duarte is removed from the government.
On the morning of February 11, the activist shared this photo:

Twitter user Másdel131 also shared a photo from the same protest:
From the Veracruz' government's representation in the Federal District, journalists protest
While Pertaesus asked:
The demand raised in the hashtag #HastaQueAparezcaGoyo raises another equally painful question-how long until we get our country back?
"Mexico is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists," according to Reporters Without Borders. The organization adds that “more than 80 have been killed in the past decade, and 17 have disappeared”.
In Mexico there is an atmosphere of uncontrolled war and violence, ever since the previous President, Felipe Calderón, launched an attack on drugs in 2006. Judging by the death of Gregorio Jiménez de la Cruz, the violence in the country continues under the administration of Enrique Peña Nieto.
As questions began to emerge over Zambian President Michael Sata's commitment to following through on a campaign promise for a new constitution, the leader stunned with a comment mocking calls for a "people-driven" constitution by asking if any country had ever passed an animal-driven one.
During a swearing in ceremony of constitution office holders, the only time Sata publicly addresses the nation on television, he said:
And for all of you here, ask the most learned woman here, Madam Chibesakunda.
You are always saying people-driven constitution, people-driven constitution.
Madam, where do you have an animal-driven constitution?
Have you ever seen an animal-driven constitution, which country because everybody is talking of people driven constitution, so once you produce the animal driven one, let’s ask Mr Phiri, once you produce the animal driven constitution, we compare the two constitutions, what we have and then we shall look at that.
As an opposition party, Zambia’s now-ruling party the Patriotic Front defeated the then-ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) in 2011 with a promise that when elected into office in elections later that year, it would pass a new constitution within 90 days of taking office.
A few weeks into office, President Sata appointed a technical committee to look into the previous constitutional making processes to come up with a new document.
The promised landmark difference with the previous processes was to be that the draft constitution was going to be simultaneously released to both the government and the public and a referendum held.

With shifting deadlines and the constitution making process running into two years, the government changed its approach and asked the technical committee to only print ten copies of the draft constitution, which the cabinet was to study first.
The draft constitution was later leaked via Zambian Watchdog and is now known as the "eleventh copy".
Some started to cast doubt on Sata’s commitment to enacting a new constitution when he said that the country did not need a fresh document altogether but only amendments to certain clauses.
At another time, Sata said the current constitution was still good because six elections had been held under it.
Nyalubinge Ngwende on his Brutal Journal blog wrote:
hen it comes to the constitution, President Sata will not fool us.
The building of roads, universities, more schools and health facilities come to mean nothing if the citizens are enslaved by political tyranny that refuses to hand them a constitution meant to unleash their full liberties and broaden opportunities for citizens, regardless of their geographical position on the global map.
A people driven constitution is our choice and not that of PF!
Ngwende goes on to explain what is meant by a people-driven constitution in a country where Cabinet with the President as the head has a played a bigger role in the enactment of constitutions by excluding clauses that people had recommended and infusing those favouring the rulers:
When civil society activists are talking of a people driven constitution, they mean a good document that will stand the test of time; with statutes that meet the aspirations of the people and one that the people themselves will agree to.
Joining a chorus of other opposition politicians and civil society organisations, MMD President Nevers Mumba commented:
I think that God has allowed him to lose his way because I can’t imagine a President making such comments.
What Zambians are saying is that look, we want a better constitution in which we participate in its formulation For him to make such comments shows arrogance of the highest level.
I appeal to the President to be presidential about this matter. We are determined to have a new constitution, with or without him anyway.
Sata ordered government officials not to respond to the constitution debate.
However, his Justice Minister and PF Secretary General Wynter Kabimba during a visit to Malawi probably gave away the biggest fear his government had in the draft document—50 percent plus one threshold for election to the office of the president and a presidential running mate for the office of vice president.
Kabimba said:
There are all these demands about 50 percent plus one constitutional provision, running mate constitutional provision without taking into account that where these provisions obtain they have caused more problems than the solutions they should have brought about to society.
We can learn from others.
We don’t have to make the same mistakes that others have made in order to do the right thing.

In the blog Panfleto Negro , John Manuel Silva and Emiliana Duarte are keeping a list of confirmed deaths from the ongoing protests taking place in Venezuela.
A day after a tiny news items titled, "Saudi Arabia 'seeking Pakistani arms for Syrian rebels" appeared in Pakistani newspapers, political blogger Ahsan Butt posts a provocative piece warning Pakistan's foreign policymakers against tiptoeing into Syria's affairs.
In "This is not our war (Syria Edition)" on the Five Rupees Blog, Ahsan writes:
What Pakistan is doing vis-a-vis Syria is one of the dumbest things Pakistan has done in a long time, and that’s really saying something.
The Syrian civil war, tragic as it is, has nothing to do with Pakistan.
Pakistan has no interests in that conflict.
None.
Saudi Arabia is in talks with Pakistan to provide Pakistan-made anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets.
Ahsan warns:
Is it wise and advisable to wade into a sectarian civil war two thousand miles away?
Just examine the trajectory of sectarian violence over the last decade.
He explains that any interference in Syria will force the Pakistani state to pay attention to rising sectarian violence in the country:
What are the possible ramifications for such a policy on sectarian violence in Pakistan?
Is it likely to exacerbate and make more deadly sectarian cleavages or the opposite?
Ahsan lists four more provocative questions which you can read here.
Demonstration in Valencia, Venezuela, on February 13, 2014.
Photo by Luis Turinese, copyright Demotix.
In various Venezuelan cities the demonstrations led and organized mostly by students have not ceased.
Protesters are demanding the release of students arrested by Venezuelan security forces.
They have received the support of a group of citizens and opposition leaders, who also demand solutions to many socio-economic problems affecting the population.
Since early February the capitals of some Andean states in the country have been the epicenter of student demonstrations which, at the beginning, called for more security in universities.
Additionally, national political personalities were promoting street assemblies , also known as #LaSalida (the exit), aiming to “promote debate and dialogue to attain a democratic exit to some of the problems affecting our nation”.
By February 12, these political leaders decided to convene a national day of protests, enlisting the support of thousands of students and citizens across the country.
The consequences of that day have led to extending the popular demonstrations.
Cities across the country are joining the call to protest, even though many of these demonstrations have resulted in violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement.
Social networks, specially Twitter, have been flooded with photos documenting the protests in each region, taking the place of the regular mass media in Venezuela, which is going through a blackout due to the government's threats to fine media who cover the protests.
During Thursday's night, on February 13, user @yirli4ny_ shared an image of a 180-meter flag being hoisted in an important highway in Puerto Ordaz, in the Guayana region:
"People: listen, join the fight" 5:08 pm 13/02
In Barcelona, Anzoátegui state, Gabriel Bastidas reported student demonstrations blocking some important avenues of the city in the early afternoon on Friday, February, 14:
3:08 pm, students demonstrate forming an SOS. The Intercomunal Avenue is blocked.
In Maracay, the capital city of Aragua state, Mare informed about the call that spreads until the night in that city:
In unison: mom, dad, support your child in this fight.
7.07 pm.
Young Venezuelans have also remained very active in Valencia, Carabobo state, as Angel Morales reported:
Students in the Bolívar Avenue walking to the Bolivar Square
According to an image published by José Meza (@josegremeza), in Maracaibo students were demanding a dialogue with police officers who arrived at the square where they were protesting:
Police overreacting in De la República square, young people force them to dialogue.
5:00 pm.
Among the reasons behind these protests are insecurity and violence, which have claimed the lives of thousands of Venezuelans.
This is depicted in many banners in Mérida, as documented by Sonia Camacho:
a touching banner!
[Banner reads: "I fight for my niece's future; criminals in Venezuela took her father away from her."
And in San Cristóbal, capital city of Táchira state, the clash between university students and the Venezuela National Guard forces still continue.
Moreover, citizens from this city came out of their homes to support protesting students who were sheltered in the Universidad Nacional Experimental del Táchira (UNET) headquarters.
Zuleik Meneses thanks them for this:
Thanks to the citizens for their support in the UNET
Finally, El Periodista Cívico (The Civic journal) has been curating information about the national demonstrations, highlighting regular updates about protesters who are under arrest in various Venezuelan regions.

One of the Taliban negotiators pulled out during a recent talk with the Pakistan government demanding that the agenda includes the strict imposition of Sharia law.
Pakistani Blogger and Journalist Beena Sarwar highlights a protest note posted in Facebook titled '10 reasons why I do not want Shariah in Pakistan' by communities The Traitors of Pakistan (Liberal/Secular Pakistanis against oppression, discrimination, extremism and intolerance) and Pakistan Votes (activist community).
Here are some gems:
1
Religion and how I choose to practice it is my business and not that of the State.
2
Enforcing Shariah will not make me a better Muslim nor will it make Pakistan a welfare state.
The world’s welfare states are all governed by secular governments.
3
I reject the idea that Shariah in any form can be enforced by those who have raped and plundered my country, blown up schools and mosques and beheaded soldiers.
I will not give these criminals the right to dictate to me.
4
I will not give up my civil rights, including freedom of thought and expression, under the guise of Shariah.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni signed a controversial anti-gay bill into law on January 24, 2014 that punishes homosexual acts with life in prison in some cases.
The parliament of Uganda overwhelmingly passed the bill on December 20, 2013.
It also provides for prison sentences for anyone who does not report gay people to authorities and punishes the use of Facebook and Twitter accounts to fight for gay rights a crime with a maximum of seven years in jail.
US President Barack Obama and other leaders around the world have warned President Museveni that the law is an abuse of human rights.
Ugandan LGBT activists say that the law makes Uganda one of the worst places to be gay in the world.
Many people have taken to social media to discuss it, some in support while others adamantly against.

Back then in Peru, terror and fear was part of our daily lives.
I had just graduated from law school in Lima. It was late 1993 and my beloved Peru was recovering from 12 years of internal conflict which had claimed tens of thousands of lives.
Christmas was coming and I decided it was time for my first journey abroad to visit a dear aunt.
My mother's elder sister moved to Venezuela in the late 1950s. She got married in Caracas and settled there with her husband and two sons. After my younger cousin died in a car accident, my mother and her sister strengthened their bond and never let distance deter them from staying in touch.
When I stepped foot outside Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, I was instantly struck by how different everything looked, compared with Lima.
Caracas was a shiny modern city, with high-rises, highways, flyovers, and recently repaved roads.
All the cars looked like they had just rolled off the factory assembly line, glossy and splendid. New cars was something we were just starting to get used to in Peru, after out-of-control hyperinflation had made all of us billionaires with little purchasing power.
The road signs looked like they had been painted the day before.
I could feel progress everywhere I looked, and this was just on the way from the airport to my aunt's house.
Rain welcomed me on this adventure, something we Limeans are not used to at all.
The next day I started my tour of the city. I didn't feel like a total outsider.
My generation grew up watching Venezuelan soap operas on TV, so some popular areas were familiar to me: Chacao, Chacaíto, the Virgen of Chiquingirá. So was the rhythmic speaking that I noticed was following me everywhere.
During a visit to one museum, I saw a guy looking at a list of battles fought by Simón Bolívar, the liberator of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú and Bolivia. There were the names of the battles with no indication of the where they'd been fought, and I stood by next to this tourist and started with a lesson learnt long ago at school: Carabobo, Venezuela; Boyacá, Bogotá, Pichincha, Ecuador; and Junín and Ayacucho, Perú (country of yours truly).
On that trip, during a visit to a beach whose name I have forgotten, my toes first felt the waters of the Atlantic, I owe that to Venezuela too.
But what impressed me above all was the freedom people had, simply living their lives. We could enter any building and there was no military officer waiting to check our bags and belongings.
There were no metal detectors or special machines that we had to pass through at the entrance of shopping centers or museums or anywhere for that matter.
I even walked in front of government buildings and ministries, as if that was the most normal thing to do. No one stopped me from being there, no one checked my documents, and no one made me feel like there was something to fear.
That is why I have been overwhelmed with sadness, as the recent stories and images have been trickling out of Venezuela.
Venezuelans are suffering.
Venezuelans are crying.
Venezuelans are mourning.
Protesters are rallying for liberty and demanding their rights be respected.
Young people are dying in the streets, as police and government supporters battle protesters.
Brothers are fighting brothers.
I prefer to remember the Venezuela I knew in 1993.
Joyous Caribbean music mingling with traditional Christmas songs wherever I went.
Smiling faces greeting me, people welcoming me with kind words and open arms, upon learning that I was Peruvian.
Venezuela, you will always be in my heart.

It is also known for the spectacular sandbank that bridges the two nearby islands.

Russian Top model Irina Shayk and wife of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo said that she has a special relationship with Madagascar:
When I was a student I did a report on Madagascar, and ever since then it was my biggest dream to go there The (Malagasy) people live and get by every day walking in the roads, living this super simple life, and they're still happy.
It is an experience that keeps you humble, puts things in perspective.
Rakotonirina Miaro wonders why the world outside Madagascar seem to appreciate the island's treasures but Malgasy citizens cannot seem to notice :
Foreigners know how beautiful our island is but we, who live here, do not seem to appreciate about our own treasures.
Oh yeah, and the swimming suit models were not bad looking either
Before the Sochi Winter Games kicked off less than two weeks ago, yours truly told US News & World Report that unrest in Ukraine might divert the attention of Russian Internet users from the Olympics.
Today, after a relative lull, violence returned to Kiev’s streets, causing a dramatic shift in RuNet activity.
Indeed, the images coming out of Ukraine depict something like a civil war.
While the news from Kiev is making headlines globally, comparative Twitter analytics demonstrate that today’s events in Ukraine galvanize Russian speakers to a degree distinct from the rest of the world.
Indeed, in the last 24 hours on Twitter, Russian users’ interest in Ukraine has surpassed their attention on the Olympics.
This reverses a trend in place since January 25, 2014, weeks before even the opening ceremony, when Russians last tweeted more about Kiev than Sochi.
The trend among Anglophone Twitter users over the last month is similar, but interest in Sochi has always dominated.
Even today, with Ukraine in flames, English-language tweets about Kiev are just over half the more than 200 thousand about the Winter Games.
While it’s no surprise that Internet users are drawn to the revolutionary display in Kiev, it is remarkable that the host of the Winter Olympics seems to have lost its home audience to a foreign event.

The situation in Venezuela continues to be extremely tense, with enormous marches and gatherings around the whole country that have left ten people killed and hundreds wounded.
Venezuelans around the world who oppose their government have organized peaceful gatherings to make their voices heard and ensure local governments understand what their compatriots are living through.
Mexico has been no exception.

Venezuelans resident in Mexico used social media to arrange a march on February 16th.
After meeting at the Simon Bolivar (Venezuela's founding father) obelisk in the Polanco area, demonstrators walked down the main Reforma Avenue towards the Angel of Independence.
There, with the support of several Mexicans, Venezuelans demanded freedom of information in the presence of media censorship and shouted in unison “freedom”, “peace”, and “no more deaths”, then sung the Venezuelan national anthem as seen in the following video :
After this march, Venezuelans arranged a vigil in front of the OAS (Organization of American States) headquarters in the Mexican capital on February 18th.
Invitation to the February 18th Vigil
Wearing white and carrying candles, Venezuelans prayed for the students who died on February 12th.
“Here is my message for Venezuela: You are not alone”, exclaimed a woman at the vigil.

"Dmitry Anatolyevich, are you sleeping again? Dmitry Anatolyevich?"
Prime Minister Medvedev, who has been as silent on the issue of Ukraine and its territorial integrity as his boss President Putin, chose an odd venue when he finally decided to make his statement.
He, or likely one of his secretaries, made a post on his Facebook account, which has already gathered over 5,000 replies, 6,000 likes and 3,000 shares.
In it he made several statements, the oddest of which was this:
Yes, the authority President Yanukovich holds is practically nil, but that does not change the fact that, according the the Ukrainian Constitution, he is the legitimate head of the state.
He then proceeded to suggest that the Ukrainian Parliament should impeach Yanukovich, if that's what they want to do.
This (valid) description of Yanukovich's authority led some Twitter users to comment on Medvedev's own flagging stature.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dmitriy Medvedev with swapped heads.
"Twins" in reverse.
One tweet that has been retweeted over 150 times joked:
While the was is on, Medvedev is staying at his grandma's
Another blogger tweeted:
Medvedev found someone who was even more pitiful than his is, and keeps trying to jump on the political corpse.
Others noted that a legitimate president with zero authority is an "oxymoron ."
"Don't worry Vic, we've got this."
Anonymous image found online.Meanwhile, Medvedev finished his Facebook post by calling Ukraine a "destitute relative":
Russia needs a strong and stable Ukraine.
A predictable and an economically sound partner.
Not a destitute relative, forever waiting for handouts.
The replies to the post start off on a positive note ("Yes, I agree" and "Well said"), but quickly become criticism of Russia's position in Ukraine and the ostensible intervention in the Crimea.
Medvedev, or his press team, has yet to respond to any of them.
The importance of the role of scientific research in the economy of the world's countries is rarely disputed.
However this impact is mostly indirect, or direct but with only a long-term impact, due to the benefits of scientific discoveries.
So the problem of research profitability in the short- to medium-term remains for many countries.
Research financing follows a variety of rules, with funds coming from the public or private sector.
For public research, the French National Research Agency uses a few numbers to explain how research is financed in France :
Public research laboratories are partially funded by budget appropriation from universities, public research bodies, and financial agencies, such as the French National Research Agency (A.N.R.). They also benefit from allocations from French administrative regions, charitable groups, industry, and from Europe.
7,000 projects funded, bringing together over 22,000 private and public research teams between 2005-2009. The cumulative amount financed between 2005-2009 is three billion euros.
Public research funding in France - Public domain.Research in France is financed by universities, research bodies, and the National Agency for Research (ANR).
It also gets contributions from the pharma industry and European Commission.
Despite the resulting efforts of the government to re-energise the sector , French research is suffering in comparison to its Anglo-Saxon neighbours and is showing signs of running out of steam.
David Larousserie puts forward the premise that scientific research in France is competitive but brings little return, in an article entitled "The limited efficacy of public research funding" :
Experts also emphasise "the good performance of research in France" but judge it "average in terms of innovation and economic return".
France publishes a lot (ranked 6th in the world) and files a good number of patents (4th place out of all European filings), but ranks 24th according to "innovation" indicators.
He adds that:
To explain the reduced room to manoeuvre despite a growing global budget, magistrates recall that the root cause is the increase in personnel costs in research organisations.
At the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), with a stable employee workforce, public subsidy increased by 293 billion euros between 2006 and 2011.
Others think that there are different factors involved, like Patrick Fauconnier, who believes that coordination between the different research organisations leaves a lot to be desired :
When we want to create a joint research unit (UMR), the structure which enables the sharing of research contracts (between a university and the CNRS for example), a lot of time and money is wasted in dealing with complex administrative problems.

Research in Africa
If research is experiencing financial difficulties in France, it's still in its early stages in most African countries.
Thus only South Africa appears in the top 30 countries in terms of investment in research and development (R&D).
Worse, no French-speaking African country appears in the top 70 of countries investing in research.
And yet Juian Siddle explains that the African continent has everything it needs to become the next large global scientifc hub:
The groundwork is there - knowledge, ingenuity, willingness to learn and adapt, coupled with the rapid expansion of digital technology.
All of this is really allowing Africa to play a major part in global scientific collaborations.
Calestous Juma, a professor of the Practice of International Development at Harvard University, adds that the context for the African continent is different:
The strategic focus for Africa should therefore be on generating research that has immediate local use.
It is through such strategies that Africa will be able to make its own unique contributions to the global scientific enterprise

Are we really helping research?
But perhaps, despite promises of help from many governments, scientific research is missing the real support of public opinion, support which would allow it to put pressure on politicians to help research in a sustainable way.
That's John Skylar's argument, in an article which responds to the fact that the page "I fucking love science" is a viral phenomenon on the web, but in reality few countries are ready to invest in quality research:
The pattern you’re seeing is a steady drop in funding of science by the government over the last 10 or 20 years.
You know what budget doesn’t match this trend?
If you loved science, you’d vote based on candidates who want to increase funding for it.
You’d make it an issue that actually generates media debate, that sees equal time with the wars we fight
Turkey has blocked Twitter - as well as Google's public DNS service, used to circumvent the block.
It seems, however, that the Turkish government's plan to censor dissent has backfired, as tweets coming out from Turkey are on the rise.
The ban on Twitter, which reportedly effects some 10 million users in Turkey, follows the publication of documents allegedly exposing corruption in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inner circle.
News reports say that Erdogan promised to "wipe out Twitter" adding that he did not care what the international community says.
Juan Cole describes Erdogan's attempt to block the micro-blogging service as "clumsy":
Erdogan’s clumsy attempt at internet censorship crashed and burned immediately.
Turkish youth are sophisticated about using Tor and VPN workarounds, and the Turkish twittersphere was reconstituted so fast it probably made Erdogan’s head spin.
Erik Meyersson adds:

Refugees UnitedThe world is more connected than ever, but when refugees fleeing conflict or disaster lose touch with loved ones - it's sometimes forever.
Among the 43 million refugees worldwide, a staggering number of people will never see their family again because they simply have no means to reach them.
Refugees United is an organization that uses the internet and mobile phones to help families torn apart.
Users of their system upload only the information they themselves find safe to share which enables them to stay anonymous.
Many people have already found family and friends via Refugees United, but the continued success of the service ultimately depends on refugees knowing that it exists.
How will they be reached?
Since last year, Global Voices translators have been working with Refugees United to translate outreach materials, social media and SMS messages into Swahili, French, Somali, Amharic, Sudanese Arabic and Standard Arabic.
We have also shared local advice on how to craft messages that clear and culturally appropriate.
Refugees United say they seek to reach 1 million people by 2015 and Global Voices is proud to offer backup.
"Our partnership with Global Voices is evidence of how we can reach even more families by collaborating with their powerful network of translators and bloggers,” says Ida Jeng of Refugees United.
The power of reconnection
On the blog of Refugees United there are countless stories about outreach and reconnections.

Is South Africa a 'Failed Country'?
South Africans have come out in defense of their country after American lawyer and political commentator Alan Dershorwitz called South Africa a "failed state" while discussing the Oscar Pistorius murder trial with Piers Morgan on news channel CNN.
The South African double-leg amputee runner fatally shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013; the Olympian claims he thought she was an intruder.

Watch Dershowitz make the assertion below:
South African economists immediately came out to dismiss his assertion, arguing that the South African state does not meet the factors that define a "failed state" such as widespread civil unrest, dysfunctional civil society, absence of an independent judiciary and a lack of protection for private property.
South Africans have taken to Twitter to express their outrage over and disapproval of his remark:

Konstantin Khabensky is one of Russia’s most famous actors.
International audiences know him best for starring in the Night Watch and Day Watch films directed by Timur Bekmambetov.
He’s also had minor roles in Western movies like Tinker Tailor Solider Spy and Wanted.
Yesterday, March 15, 2014, a day before Crimea’s secessionist referendum, a message appeared on a social network page supposedly belonging to Khabensky, where the actor denounced Vladimir Putin and expressed his support for Ukraine.
In follow-up posts, Khabensky revealed that hate mail flooded his inbox, after his pro-Ukraine post.
In many countries, political statements by actors that criticize a sitting president are a perfectly ordinary occurrence.
In Russia, it is exceedingly rare for anyone who regularly appears on television or the silver screen to criticize, let alone denounce, Vladimir Putin.
In fact, people as famous as Khabensky are far likelier to laud the President in times of international crisis.
For instance, more than five hundred cultural figures recently signed a public letter of support for Putin’s position on “Ukraine and Crimea.”
The letter, with a list of signatories, was published on the Ministry of Culture’s official website.
There is strong reason to suspect, however, that Khabensky is not the author of the pro-Ukraine, anti-Putin post on Vkontakte.
The account in question does claim to be an “official page,” displaying a green checkmark denoting as much, but this is not how Vkontakte formally recognizes official pages.
Study the site’s policies and you’ll see that Vkontakte identifies official pages by adding a blue checkmark immediately to the right of a user’s name.
(Look at Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's page for a clear example.)
In other words, Khabensky’s Vkontakte page is not verified, but the owner of the account wants readers to think it is.
That should set off alarm bells: the page is probably fake.
We got a law that upped the punishment for rape, as well as broadened the definition to rape in a grand promise to more and more people – when the fundamental problem was that people who were raped as per the old definitions and punishments weren’t getting justice already in a country with one rape in seven minutes, but not one rape judgment.
Vidyut at AamJanata questions whether the newly enacted rape law in India is really helping women.
Following Malawi's government decision to introduce English as a medium of instruction from grade one, Steve Sharra defends local languages and makes the case for multilingualism:
Teachers and lecturers in our secondary schools and universities are observing a trend in which students from private schools speak perfect English, but their reasoning, writing and problem-solving skills are not well developed.
This is even as the Independent Schools Association of Malawi (ISAMA) is reporting reporting that 80 percent of students selected to Malawian universities are coming from private schools.
Language researchers have also found that children who speak more than one language exhibit better academic performance than children who know only one language, regardless of what that language is.
This is why our language of instruction policy needs to promote multilingualism, and not monolingualism.
Just a generation ago most Malawians were multi-lingual, speaking two or more languages on average.
Today’s generation knows two languages, English and Chichewa, on average.
If we do not enact policies to develop our local languages, the coming generations of Malawians will be reduced to only one language, English.
Monolingualism encourages insularity, a restricted worldview in which the only knowledge available to one is from one linguistic source.
The danger with the new policy, as it stands, is the damage it can potentially cause to Malawian languages.
The new policy will mean that as a country we will allocate more resources to English at the expense of nurturing and developing local languages.
Although South Korea seems to be plugging unification with North Korea, experts are a little hesitant about projecting North Korea's imminent collapse.
NKnews.org published a nice post on the chance of the dictatorial regime's disintegration, concluding that 'Pyongyang's belated economic reforms make 'middle-run' scenarios more likely'.
The Mauritanian capital Nouakchott witnessed violent clashes between security forces and an angry crowd.
The story is that anonymous people tore up the Quran, the holy book of Islam, in one of the city's mosques.
As a result of this confrontation, one person was killed various people were injured and traffic was blocked in many parts of Nouakchott.
The clashes happened on March 3.
Commenting the incident, blogger Abbas Braham urged his Facebook friends to be cautious and not fall in the trap of extremism (no matter what it is) :
Today's Koran"desecration"incident in the Capital Nouakchott is a case that raises concern and caution.
It is now clear that both sacred extremism and desecration are feeding each another.
Thousands of people are demonstrating on the streets to protest against low salaries, the high cost of living and an insufficient state safety net.

Or a follow-up to the Arab Spring?
No, these are protests for greater equality in Sub-Saharan Africa, most recently in Burkina Faso.
The widening gap between rich and poor is as troubling in Africa as in the rest of the world.
In fact, many Africans believe that inequalities are becoming more marked: A tiny minority is getting richer while the lines of poor people grow out the door.
The contrast is all the more striking in Africa since the poverty level has been at a consistently high level for decades, despite the continent's significant average GDP growth.

A columnist from the independent daily L'Observateur Paalga in Burkin Faso explains the general feeling of discontent :
Some take a plane to get treated for hay fever, while others are pushing up daisies because they can’t afford basic malaria treatment.
However, growth in Africa is expected - the World Bank paints an optimistic picture of African potential, but warns against persistently high inequalities:
Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains strong with growth forecasted to be 4.9% in 2013.
Almost a third of countries in the region are growing at 6% and more, and African countries are now routinely among the fastest-growing countries in the world notes that poverty and inequality remain “unacceptably high and the pace of reduction unacceptably slow.”
Almost one out of every two Africans lives in extreme poverty today.
Revenue inequality in African towns via French documentation - Public domain
Denis Cogneau, responsible for research at the Institute of Research for Development (IRD), explains that these inequalities in Africa have a well-defined historical origin :
Postcolonial states inherited extractive economic and social institutions, characterised by a sharply marked dualism between a small formal sector and a huge informal sector, including farmers.
Similarly, many countries are characterised by a dualism in education and health, distinguished by the coexistence of expensive, private and public elite institutions situated in the capital, and a core sector (primary schools and health centres) lacking personnel, poorly stocked, and unevenly spread out across the region.
In this context, school plays a very dangerous role, as it was (and still is) one of the keys of entry "not only to jobs in the modern sector, but also to positions in the state apparatus and political power, mirroring the evolution of European societies".
Consequently, the unequal chances of gaining access imply a more marked reproduction of the political elite.
What measures can be taken to reduce these inequalities?
At a a local level, efforts are often not made to understand the exact circumstances that lead to growing inequality.
Several organisations have implemented tools to monitor the lives of vulnerable populations in order to clarify the reasons behind it.
In Madagascar, CIRAD (a French research centre working with developing countries to tackle international agricultural and development issues) has proposed the creation of an observatory to carry out monitoring and improve living standards in rural areas :
The network of local rural observatories (ROR) consists of a tool that tracks and analyses living conditions in rural households.
One of the principal objectives is to gain an understanding of the evolution of the situation in rural households and the impact that public measures and external shocks have on these households.
Each observatory is made up of a panel of 500 households in sites chosen in agreement with the landowner.
The questionnaire covers the main aspects of household life over a 12-month period.
The results mean we can make a comparison in time (per year) and in space (between observatories).
Sexual inequality in Burkina Faso has been identified as a significant barrier to development, as studies have shown that the participation of women in the active life of a country has a considerable impact on its development.
Bougnan Naon explains what the Dakupa Association is doing on this topic in the Boulgou province:
The aim of the project is to enable the creation of a functional network with competent members in order to influence traditional attitudes/practices, as well as local policies and strategies which fight against gender inequalities (The objective is to) create 50 local key players with strategies to ensure gender is taken into account when launching projects and programs each year, and for the NGO to get closer to its targets by organising supervisors to facilitate the effective application of the approach (learning the tools and identifying pertinent gender actions).
Human remains who were killed during the colonial war (early 20th century) were returned to Namibia by Germany in March.
However, Namibians still demand a formal apology from the German government as Tendai Marima, a post-doctoral researcher in African literature, wrote on the Think Africa Press website :
The skulls and skeletons that made their way home this month were seized by Germany back when Namibia − then 'German South-West Africa' − was one its colonies.
Namibia was first occupied by the European power in 1884, and in 1904, the Herero and Nama peoples − dispossessed of their land and livestock − rose up together in an attempt to expel the Germans.
In an early revolt, over 100 German settlers and soldiers were killed, but the ensuing repression of the uprising was relentless and brutal.
Over the three years it took to suppress the uprising, an estimated 65,000 Hereros and 10,000 Nama were killed, representing some 80% and 50% of those entire populations respectively.
It is considered the first genocide of the 20th century.
The group Saya Anak Bangsa Malaysia is pushing for the passage of a Social Inclusion Act to address the problem of poverty in Malaysia:

Kuwait is happy with its very own version of Pharrell's Happy music video.
The video, above, which features contributions from more than 150 citizens and residents, is the brainchild of director Taibah AlQatami and is produced by film maker Mohammed Al Saeed.
According to @Loft965:
The intention was to reengineer Pharrell’s “Happy” song into an effective message locally by filming specified locations within the city as well as reintroducing “Free Kuwait” t-shirts which were worn during the Gulf War as people were demanding the liberation of their country.
Today the youth are maintaining the atmosphere of liberation in spreading positivity and celebrating freedom of expression.
A US-led coalition liberated Kuwait in February 1991, after an eight-month Iraqi invasion.

Faine Greenwood writes about the Stanford lecture given by Cambodian human rights activist Ou Virak.
Asked about the anti-government protests taking place in Cambodia, Ou Virak explained why it would not lead to a 'political spring':
I don’t think a spring in Cambodia will happen, nor do I think it’s desirable...We don’t even have a word for spring in Khmer.
The closest word is revolution, which reminds people of Khmer Rouge.
He also criticized the opposition party for failing to provide a clear political agenda:
I haven’t seen an agenda…The only thing I’ve seen is how much we hate Hun Sen, and how much we hate Vietnam...That’s a formula for disaster, going in with so much hate.
We have no idea what we are fighting for.
March 5, 2014 marked two-year anniversary of KONY 2012 campaign:
Two years ago today we started a campaign called KONY 2012.
It was an experiment to see if the world was ready to unite and speak out against the horrific and unseen crimes of Joseph Kony and the LRA.
The world was. Together, we made Kony famous and put the issue of LRA violence on the table of popular and political interest.
One element of the campaign was calling on culture and policy makers to work in their sphere of influence to stand up for Kony’s child soldiers.
You led our leaders to take action that resulted in tangible results.
As part of our celebrations, we’ve decided to thank the politicians that gave a gift to justice through their support of KONY 2012.

Support for the protesters has poured in from a variety of groups, with hundreds of translators organizing themselves through the Facebook group #CSSTAtranslategroup to translate stories about the incident.
The group describes its objectives as:
1
Short-term goal: to distribute the press release that has been translated into various languages to international media and government units;
2
Mid-term goal: to watch the next move between the Chinese and Taiwanese Governments closely and translate upcoming news into English and other languages.
The translated articles will be published on the blog Taiwan, not for sale.
There is also a Danish version in summary.
To draw the world's attention to the protest, student activist Yeh Jiunn Tyng translated the following message into 31 different languages on his Facebook profile:
Citizens of Taiwan are now occupying the Legislative Yuan（Legislature), opposing the unjust passing of the Cross-Strait Agreement on Trade in Services.
The police are gathering outside the building and preparing to clear the protesters.
This moment is critical for the future and democracy of Taiwan, we need the world's attention.
Please share the news to everyone you know, and translate it to other languages. (Please post the translation in the comment of this post, I'll add it in).
God bless Taiwan.

An "unidentified" soldier is defending this Russian-speaking cat.
"Thanks for the fact that I'm no longer a "kit"" (Ukrainian for "cat" (kit) is a homonym of Russian for whale (kit)).
While people talk about government censorship of Russian media and the Internet all the time, it is actually more common for censorship to be self-imposed by news agencies on a lower, corporate level.
The original post was written by Roman Romanenko of Vologodsk, on March 4, 2014.
In it Romanenko, who also works in the media, wrote an ironic address calling on Putin to "occupy" Vologodsk Region, in order to protect the rights of "Russian-speaking" people living there.
Romanenko was, of course, referring to Russia's alleged occupation of the Crimean Peninsula (Russian officials still deny Russian troops are present there).
Specifically he wrote :
We are all Russian-speaking here, and our rights are being infringed upon.
Our sick can't get the medicine and medical attention they need, our education gets worse every year Also, we've heard that you are planing to spend a lot of money to improve the lives of Crimeans.
We hesitate to ask: can this money we spent to improve life in Vologodsk Region.
Because our region is in major debt, we've got no money for anything.
And we need bridges, roads, sports, industrial development, new work places...
Alexander Erenko, a journalist from Perm, re-posted this message on his wall, changing the Vologodsk Region to his own home town.
Although it was shared only 44 times, in contrast to the 3,323 times Romanenko's original was shared, the post apparently ran afoul of one of Erenko's managers.
Erenko was fired within the hour, reports Echo of Perm (a local office of Echo Moskvy).
In the meantime, Romanenko wasn't the only one to bring up an incongruity in how Moscow seems to treat potential citizens in Crimea, and how it treats its own citizens at home.
This tweet from blogger Irina Petrova was retweeted almost one thousand times, opposition leader Alexey Navalny among them (even though he is currently under house arrest and technically incommunicado):
The governor of Moscow Region will set aside 40 million rubles from the regional budget to repair a hospital in Crimea.
Madness!!
Has he been to Moscow Region hospitals???
Pierre Nkurunziza, President of Burund - Public domain
At least 19 violent incidents have been documented since the beginning of 2014 in Burundi ahead of the presidential elections. The unrest centers on amendments to the constitution proposed by president Nkurunziza that could allow him to run for a third term.
The CNDD-FDD ruling party and its youth wing are accused of disrupting opposition's meetings and the killing of one opposition leader.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expresses concerns over the situation :
Next year’s elections will be a key test for Burundi.
Continued political violence is a threat to the democratic process in a country which is still slowly recovering from a devastating protracted civil war
An expat blogger writes about how she spent winter in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.
I spent most of the coldest times huddled next to the space heater (pechka), cup of tea in hand.
Some mornings everything in the kitchen froze.
I once tried to pour hot water into a cold cup and it cracked in half...
On several nights the electricity went out, sometimes for hours...
The story helps understand why Dushanbe was recently ranked the worst city in Asia for expatriates to live in.
Tencent’s WeChat, semi-private messaging service has replaced Twitter-like Sina Weibo as a leading channel of alternative information.
The popular Maidan Translations blog republished a Facebook post by Dmitry Tymchuk, Head of the Ukrainian Center for Military-Political Studies, that describes several alleged international violations and "irregular actions" since late February 2014.
Tymchuk begin this run-down by saying:
For instance, on February 28, at 8.45 a.m. the flight of more than 10 military helicopters was monitored by the technical observation post located on the cape of Takil from the direction of the Russian Federation to Ukraine.
Three helicopters (two KA-27 and one Mi-8) landed at the Kacha airport and passed through the border and customs established procedures according to an application made preliminarily.
The rest of the helicopters came down near the airport; herewith, there was no answer received on the border detail chief’s appeal concerning the necessity of passing the established formalities by these helicopters, which arrived without a preliminary made application in violation of relevant agreement.
The chief of the border detail of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine made a statement of Ukrainian border violation by aforementioned helicopters.

A state-of-the-art execution machine designed by @Ternz to help Egypt execute 529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters
Egypt today sentenced 529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death for their roles in violent riots in Minya, in Upper Egypt, last August.
The riots broke out following a crackdown on sit-ins in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, which left hundreds of supporters dead.
The Minya riots left one police officer dead - a crime all 529 defendants are accused of.
In Egypt, the sentence, one of the largest death sentences in modern history, was both rebuked or lauded, depending on which end of the political spectrum the reactions came from.
Mada Masr tallies up reactions here.
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia says this sentence, for which a final verdict is due to be issued on April 28, breaks a new world record.
She explains:
I am speaking about the historical court rule of Minya criminal court against 529 defendants , yup the one which the whole world is speaking about.
Zeinobia adds:
I will speak about fact here :
529 defendants were sentenced to death and 15 were acquitted in the Rabaa dispersal aftermath in Minya trial.
139 were detained in the case while the rest were either released on bail or on the run.
Only 51 defendants attended the trial because the space could not hold more defendants.
The trial started on Saturday and ended on Monday.
The lawyers of the defendants demanded to replace the Judges panel but their request was rejected.
The lawyers of the defendants "not in absentia" were not allowed to defend their defendants !!
The 529 defendants are accused of killing deputy Sheriff Mostafa El Attar of Matay Police Station !!
This is the biggest mass death sentence in the history of Egyptian judiciary.
Egypt-based journalist Bel Trew wonders:
Can't imagine how you would even hang 529 people.If it just took 5 mins to hang 1 person that's over 44 hours of continuous slaughter #Egypt — Bel Trew - بل ترو (@Beltrew) March 24, 2014
And Egyptian @Ternz, who admits to starting to draw cartoons only two weeks ago, has come up with a solution: a state-of-the-art execution machine.
He explains :
While I was sitting in a relaxed state of mind, I asked myself: How can I best serve my country?
How can I benefit it and help it?
So I took a pen and designed a machine Egypt needs in this phase
And here's his masterpiece:
As a contribution from me in competently implementing the execution sentences, I hope that this device interests the officials.
This is a state-of-the-art execution machine
Meanwhile, UK-based journalist Inigo Gilmore concludes:
Egypt wants tourists to return, as it cages journalists like animals & sentences 100s others to death in sham trials? pic.twitter.com/suTyNEcSeE — Inigo Gilmore (@InigoGilmore) March 24, 2014
The Banner for the 2014 forum for francophone women in Kinshasa, DRC - Public Domain
The 2014 Forum for Francophone Women Opens today in Kinshasa, DRC.
This is the second installment of the forum following the initial one in Paris in 2013.
While the first forum focused on reducing violence against women in conflict areas, The objective of the 2014 forum will be dedicated to the role of women in development.
Three workshops will be held : women and education, women and power, women and peace.
A focus group will address the issue of girls education up to 16 years old.
The chief of military intelligence for South Sudan denies that there was an attempted coup there on December 15, 2013.
PaanLuel Wel reports:
Reports from Juba have it that the head of military intelligence, Gen. Mac Paul Kuol Awar, has rubbished the alleged coup attempt of December 15, 2013.
Mac Paul was called as a government witness to testify against the detained 4 political prisoners (Pagan, Oyai, Majak and Gatkuoth) who are arraigned in court, charged with treason.
Ironically, the Director of military intelligence, who was called to back up government’s assertion that there was a coup, came out strongly arguing that there was no such thing as a coup.
Instead, he said, it was a misunderstanding among the soldiers of Tiger Battalion, which was then mishandled till it escalated into a countrywide rebellion.

An Ebola outbreak killed at least 59 people in Guinea and a few suspected cases near the Capital Conakry suggest that it may have spread to the Guinean capital.
Barbara Krief provides the latest updates :
At least eight health workers have been killed so far.
In collaboration with the Guinean Ministry of Health, UNICEF has delivered in most affected areas five tons of medicines and medical equipment such as gloves, plastic mats, blankets, nose guard, and rehydration solutions to protect medical staff and treat patients.
Here is a video providing information on how to protect oneself from the Ebola virus : Follow our in-depth coverage: The Struggle to #StopEbola in West Africa
Koolsaina writes that a Malagasy girl killed herself after photos of her were posted on a Facebook page that showcase photos of young women from Madagascar without their consent.
A call to Facebook administrators was initiated to take down the page.
As of today (March 16, 2014), Koolsaina reports that the page is still accessible.
He is accused of “organising a ‘No to Military Trial for Civilians’ protest”.
This video posted by Mahmoud Salmani on YouTube shows Abdel Fattah being welcomed by family and friends as he left the police station:
And Galal Amr shares this photograph showing Abdel Fattah embracing his wife Manal Hassan: "We will continue.." Nadine Marroushi translates the tweet:
@Sarahcarr @Fouda_ @_NSalem_ so better translation "we painted the air with doko. true we got fucked afterwards, but we'll continue" ? — Nadine Marroushi (@nadinemarroushi) March 23, 2014
Doko is spray paint in the Egyptian dialect.
In addition to Abdel Fattah, Ahmed Abdel Rahman was also released today.
Abdel Rahman, who was passing by the protest, was arrested along with Abdel Fattah, as he was helping some girls who were being harassed by the police.
On Twitter, celebrations are in full swing.
Ahdaf Souief, Abdel Fattah's aunt, exclaims:
Twitter is bursting with joy at @alaa's release.
My laptop needs a break. — Ahdaf Soueif (@asoueif) March 23, 2014
Mona Seif, Abdel Fattah's sister, celebrates her brother's release saying:
Alaa and Ahmed are on the street .. This is the greatest sentence in the world
Despite the release order, Abdel Fattah's family was made to wait for hours outside the police station to collect him.
Seif describes the ordeal:
We have been waiting outside the police headquarters and don't understand the reason for the delay.
Some journalists are calling us to tell us that their sources are telling them they will be released tomorrow
And she adds:
The bails have been paid and we have completed the formalities with the Public Prosecution and the police station and Ahmed Abdelrahman has left the police car and has been in the police station for a long period of time.
Why is the delay and why is there so much redtape in each step?
The case has been adjourned to April 6.
This video of an Egyptian woman asking US President Barak Obama to "shut up your mouse " is making the rounds:
In the video, the unidentified woman says she has a message for Obama.
She then switches to English saying:
Listen your Obama.
We are Egyptian women.
You are listen Obama.
Shut up your mouse Obama.
Shut up your mouse Obama.
Sisi yes.
Sisi yes.
Morsi no.
Morsi no.
Sisi is Field Marshall Abdel Fattah El Sisi, the Commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces who is being marketed as the country's next President while Morsi is the Muslim Brotherhood member who was ousted from the presidency he won following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak at the start of the Egyptian revolution.
And there's a remix of the video:
And if this isn't enough, there's a photograph to make you remember the quote:
Shut Up Your Mouse Obama!
March 16, 2014 marked the 1,000th day of imprisonment for Ethiopian journalist Reeyot Alemu.
She is serving a five-year sentence after she was found guilty on terrorism charges in January 2012.
Jailed Ethiopian journalist Reeyot Alemu.
Photo via Facebook page of Free Reyoot Alemu campaign.
Reeyot, an English teacher, is the recipient of the UNESCO-Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize, the Hellman/Hammett award, and the International Women's Media Foundation Courage in Journalism Award.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the Ethiopian government has convicted 11 independent journalists and bloggers including Reeyot and Eskinder Nega under a sweeping anti-terrorism law since 2011.
Among those jailed are two Swedish journalists who are serving an 11-year sentence for allegedly supporting an ethnic Somali rebel group.
In this blog post, blogger BefeQadu Z Hailu described the plight of imprisoned Ethiopian journalists:
If the objective of imprisonment is to correct the convicted ones, then to encourage reading and education should be one of the tools to meet the objective.
In Kality prison both are allowed but not easily to these journalists and others who are convicted in relation to ‘terrorism’.
These prisoners are not allowed to get books.
Eskinder says, “Especially those kinds of books that have titles combining words of ‘Ethiopia’ and ‘history’ are not allowed in.”
The same is true to the ward of Reeyot Alemu and others such as Wubshet Taye, Bekele Gerba, etc.
Local independent newspapers and magazines are not also allowed in; Eskinder further explained it to me that even News TV channels like BBC and Aljazeera are not allowed to be viewed in zones where he and others are imprisoned.
Reeyot Alemu, after a tough struggle with the prison admins and after the media revealed the story, is now allowed to get distance education.
But, it is still difficult for her to get supplementary books other than the books directly sent to her from the College.
Twitter users sent out tweets using the hashtag #ReeyotAlemu to express their support for the jailed journalist.
Below are a sample of tweets:
Hope the world cares about her too!

On March 18, 2014, two days after Crimeans voted in a referendum to join the Russian Federation, President Vladimir Putin gave a speech in which he announced that he would bring Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol into the fold as two new federation members.
Until this announcement was made, it was not clear whether Russia would annex the new territories outright, or if it would leave them as an independent, contested region like Abkhazia, South Ossetia, or Transnistria.
Regardless of how one feels about the Crimean question, it was a landmark speech, and one that bloggers reacted to the way they usually do on the Internet. Through memes.
Here are some of them:
1
Putin as Tony Stark.
The caption reads "Got Crimea back."
Anonymous image found online.
After all, even according to opposition polls a majority supports the "re-acquiring" of the picturesque peninsula.
2
Anonymous image found online.
For others, the feelings were more mixed.
If Putin "stole" Crimea, is it still a good thing?
Perhaps it's hip, like a video game.
3
-"Must not sleep, must not sleep"-"Zzzzzz"Anonymous image found online.
You can depend of PM Dmitry Medvedev to provide a sense of stability and narrative.
His falling asleep during public functions has certainly been a common thread over the last couple of months of Russian policy-making.

"Starting today I get rid of all American products in my life.
Friends, join me! #StopUSA" tweeted Mikhail Dvorkovich, a Russian businessman and brother to a Medvedev adviser, as a response to threat of American sanctions against Russian officials.
Many people pointed out the irony of him tweeting from an iPhone, and, indeed, using an American founded service to reach out to his audience.
5
President Obama dressed in an FSB (Federal Security Bureau) uniform.
Anonymous image found online.
Some Russian bloggers seem to view weak American sanctions as a sign of US tacit support of President Putin's actions.
Hence this rather delicate photoshop of him in a Russian security forces uniform.
"Thanks comrade Obama!"

Users of the public Facebook group "This is Kiev, baby" are making their displeasure known.

This particular reaction seems as vehement as it is futile.

"Find 10 differences."

Nazi comparisons have been a mainstay of the discourse between Ukrainians and Russians for the last few months, and now, post a new "Anschluss," it is no different.

M-Pesa payment till at a restaurant in Kenya.
Photo released under Creative Commons by Wikipedia user Raidarmax.
March 2014 marks seven years since M-Pesa, a mobile-phone based money transfer and micro-finance service, was introduced to Kenya by telecoms company Safaricom.
M-Pesa works like a bank: subscribers store money in their mobile phones and withdraw it from a Safaricom shop or the company's agents by providing photo identification and a designated number.
Safaricom was the first company in Kenya to offer mobile money transfers.
It remains the dominant player today, with other companies such as Airtel, Orange and Yu also offering similar services.
To celebrate the seven-year anniversary, Safaricom encouraged Kenyans on Twitter to use the hashtag #BeforeMPESA to explain how the service has affected their lives.
Here are the three most common responses:
1
M-Pesa has given Kenyans an alternative way to store money safely:

Some Kenyans used the anniversary to express frustration with M-Pesa and criticize those praising the service:

Samuel Gikuru questioned Safaricom's motives and even accused the company of stealing the idea from a Kenyan:
Is it me or has someone else noted Safaricom is doing everything with intent on Killing Kenyan Tech Start Ups?
From venturing into Pay TV,insurance…A story is told in Kenya of how a Kenyan was robbed off his billion dollar idea that is todays Mpesa.The brain child/think tank is said to have approached Safaricom executives who turned him away saying his idea couldn’t be done only for them to launch the service a few months later.Thats the story on every Kenyan lips.However,a new book reveals that a senior Vodafone employee conceived M-Pesa in 2003.
An Ismanto from Yogyakarta in Indonesia observes how new western-style cafes are edging out 'plastic tent-covered food carts' known as 'angkringan':
...the angkringan is in decline.
Students don’t frequent them anymore, preferring to pay at least twice as much to eat, drink and socialise in the stylish surrounds of the kafe.
If they think of angkringan at all, it is as something exotic, still a Yogyakarta icon, but a place frequented by people with thin wallets, not classy, rich students.
There’s no social prestige for students in that company.
Malaysian Airline.
Flickr photo by planegeezer (CC License)On Saturday 8th of March, news media around the world reported that a plane by Malaysia Airlines en route to China went missing.
Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing lost contact with air traffic controllers, with the airline and authorities being unable to locate the aircraft since.
The flight was carrying 227 passengers and 12 cabin crew.
According to The Guardian newspaper, the aircraft lost radar contact in Vietnamese airspace.
The airline has since posted several times on its Facebook page providing public updates about the situation, including a statement by its CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya:
We deeply regret that we have lost all contacts with flight MH370 which departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41 am earlier this morning bound for Beijing.
The aircraft was scheduled to land at Beijing International Airport at 6.30am local Beijing time.
Subang Air Traffic Control reported that it lost contact at 2.40am (local Malaysia time) today.
Flight MH370 was operated on a Boeing B777-200 aircraft.
The flight was carrying a total number of 239 passengers and crew – comprising 227 passengers (including 2 infants), 12 crew members.
The passengers were of 13 different nationalities.
Malaysia Airlines is currently working with the authorities who have activated their Search and Rescue team to locate the aircraft.
Our team is currently calling the next-of-kin of passengers and crew.
Another press release by the airline identified the pilot as Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who has 18,365 flying hours under his belt.
On Twitter, many have expressed concern and worry:
Flown Malaysia Airlines @MAS many times, including one of their 777-200s from KL to Shanghai.

I've asked all measures possible to be taken. — Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) March 8, 2014
Reuters have now reported that the plane crashed in the South China Sea, however no official announcement has been made at the time of writing.

While shooting a documentary in Cambodia, filmmaker Roberto Serrini found time to visit several urban and rural villages in the country.
His team used a DJI Phantom drone and a GoPro camera to capture the mesmerizing beauty of Cambodia.
He described the filming as an ‘amazing experience’:
On location in Phnom Pehn and the rural village of Anluk Leak, I was able to explore the cinematic beauty of this land from the sky.
A truly amazing experience, as many of these children have never seen a working television, let alone a flying drone; the mixture of excitement, trepidation, and awesome wonder was a treat to see on their faces.
Below are some Flickr photos of Roberto’s travel in Cambodia:

Organizers of the event, 8th of September and the Macedonian Platform Against Poverty, are demanding a change in social welfare laws to provide decent basic income for Macedonia's poorest citizens.
The event proceeded peacefully, with one exception - a police officer harassed a journalist and protester.
Activist Petrit Saracini wrote on Facebook:
The march and the concert against poverty went well, without the incidents 'predicted' by pro-government media.
Except at one point, when, who else but the police, went overboard, and asked for the ID of a cameramen.
When the director of Helsinki Committee asked what they are doing, she was roughly pushed to the ground, in front of people and in front of cameras.
They didn't care.
For maybe less than 1000 people they had 1000 armed police officers.
May they spend their overtime pay in health.
We pay for them anyway.
The director of the Macedonian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization, Uranija Pirovska stated that she intended to file a complaint with the Ministry of Interior based on a video clip that documented the event, along with eyewitness testimonies.
In September 2013, the private television channel Nova TV reported and analyzed a similar incident, in which police forced their cameraman to delete footage of police aggression against protesters who were trying to protect a landmark Skopje public park from destruction.
To date, no action has been taken against the perpetrator of this incident.
In front of government buildings protesters were met by a police cordon and a cordon of ancient statues- real archeological artifacts - set there in 2007.

The project was launched today and by June this year (yes, in 3 months), the pilot of 245 schools is expected to be done.
After that the project will be evaluated and the second phase rolled out in three to five years.
“In addition to the free Internet, Wananchi will provide each school with a digital set top box for connection to a television for use in delivery of audio content to students.

Ricey Wild, a Native American blogger at the Indian Country Today, writes about wolf slaughtering in Minnesota, USA.
My beloved friend Melissa came to get me last month to rally against the wolf hunt in Minnesota and everywhere.
We went way up north and joined other people who care and are disgusted with the massacre taking place upon the wolf population.
I look at my Mitzi and I can’t tell that her nearest relatives are okay to slaughter just because.
I imagined a pack of Mitzi’s being pursued by ‘hunters’ and her wondering what she ever did to them?
Why are they murdering her family?
So yes, I cried and vowed to make my voice and presence acknowledged..

Prominent Egyptian blogger Alaa Abd El Fattah completed his 100th day in prison without trial today.
Abd El Fattah was violently beaten and arrested from his Cairo home on November 26, 2013 and accused of "organising a 'No to Military Trial for Civilians' protest" two days prior to his arrest.
According to Rasha Abdulla, Advox author and a friend of Abd El Fattah:
He has been detained since November 28, after being accused of organizing a protest in front of The Shura Council (the upper house of Egypt's Parliament) without obtaining legal permission.
Two days prior to the protest, legislators passed a law requiring all protest organizers to submit logistical information about planned protests to the Ministry of the Interior.
The protest in question was organized by the No to Military Trials for Civilians group, a campaign initiated by Mona Seif but of which her brother Alaa is not a member.
The group has issued a press statement claiming responsibility for the organization of the protest.
Members of the group have also filed a report with the public prosecutor claiming responsibility for the event.
The protest, which took place on November 26, called for the abolishing of military trials for civilians in the new constitution which Egypt is to vote on later this month .
The protest was violently dispersed by the police roughly half an hour after it began.
Police detained 11 women, most of them members of the No to Military Trials group, and 24 men.
The women, all of whom were beaten and some of whom were sexually harassed while being detained, remained in custody for a few hours.
They were then forced to ride a police car and thrown in the desert sometime after midnight.
The men were detained for a week and are now released (except for one, Ahmed Abdel Rahman) pending investigation.
Alaa was detained after police stormed his house two days later and accused him of organizing the protest.
This allegation came despite the fact that Alaa waited outside the police station where his sister was detained on November 26 all evening until she was picked up by friends after police threw her and her colleagues in the desert.
Although both Alaa and Ahmed Abdel Rahman have been detained for over a month pending investigation, no court date has been assigned yet for the case.
The situation remains the same today.
A court date is yet to be assigned - 100 days after his arrest.
Tahrir Diaries posted this video on YouTube to make the 100th day anniversary of Abd El Fattah's arrest.
It features Manal Hassan, describing what happened to her husband Abd El Fattah, and No to Military Trials member Nazly Hassan, who outlines the ordeal of Ahmed Abdul Rahman, a passer-by who politely asked police at the protest why they were beating and sexually harassing women participants.
The feature image with this post shows "Freedom for Alaa Abd El Fattah" written on the ground outside the Military Prosecution building in Cairo.

The African continent appears to be the new global frontier of digital development.
This development has caused a new entrepreneurial impulse in Africa, particularly in Francophone Africa.
But this potential remains largely unknown in Europe and in France.
To change this, Samir, author of the blog Startup BRICS that specializes in start-ups in the emerging countries, organized a field mission called the TechAfrique project to identify and list technology initiatives, start-ups, Fablabs projects, and other co-working places of tech creativity in Francophone Africa and Kenya.
In the context of the number and scale of projects being undertaken via government to government arrangements, Afra Raymond explains why Trinidad and Tobago's current high-level State mission to China is "a critical issue to delve into."

Madagascar president Hery Rajaonarimampianina - Public domain
The newly elected president of Madagascar Hery Rajaonarimampianina created his twitter account on March 23, 2014.
Here is his first tweet :
First tweet by president of Madagascar
It is quite possibly the most meta tweet ever from a head of state.
Only media mugol Rupert Murdoch might challenge the level of "metaness" of his first tweet.
Kristoff Titeca looks beyond a single explanation on Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill:
A crucial point is that President Museveni has never been an outspoken supporter of the bill, instead being rather dubious about it: he was fully aware of the disastrous international consequences.
In his first public reaction after the introduction of the bill, he argued how it did “not represent the party of government position” and how “Uganda cannot risk its foreign policy by allowing the Bill to pass in its current form”.
In the following years, the bill was weakened and consistently shelved, (in 2009, 2011 and 2013), until it reappeared on 20th December 2013, when it was passed by parliament.
After its passing, Museveni continued to pursue an ambiguous position: he claimed how the bill was passed without his consultation, and in a rushed manner, by a small number of MPs led by speaker Kadaga.
This had then forced him to look further into the matter.
In his interviews and statements, Museveni has consistently focused on two issues: On the recruitment of homosexuals (and related with this, the ‘recruited’, those who become homosexuals for ‘mercenary reasons’), and secondly, ‘exhibitionism’ of homosexual behavior.
In doing so, he left a loophole, being that there was a possibility that certain people were ‘born homosexual (…) rare deviations in nature from the normal’.
In doing so, he could both satisfy the domestic constituency – he was criticizing homosexuals - but also the international constituency, by leaving this loophole open.
For example, even after announcing that he was going to sign the bill, in a response to Obama’s criticism, Museveni argued how he encouraged the US government to provide evidence that some people are born homosexual, which would then allow him to review the legislation.
People are angry and tired, and media houses often publish news about the connection between political leaders and goons but no one takes to the streets to protest corruption – an anomaly for a country where people have Nepal Bandhs, country-wide strikes for every distress.

Syrian Students for a Better Future is a WordPress blog by Syrian students at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
The students are studying in the US as part of Jusoor Initiative to help Syrians continue their higher education outside Syria through scholarships.
The blog, which has posts in Arabic and English, reflects the students hopes, doubts, worries, optimism, homesickness and wishes for a better future in their home.
Safouh Takrouri wrote his post Our Berlin Wall in Syria saying:
After reuniting the people of German, individuals and communities started to plan for its future.
A future free from wars, blood and disputes.
A future full of achievements and development.
People now in Syria are divided in two groups – maybe more.
Each group has its own opinion, and believes in its own vision for the future of the country.
Each group is right in so many points; and wrong in too many ways as well.
No doubt, each group loves their country and some are ready to give their souls freely for it.
While to many victims of this horrific violence and suffering never asked for their lives and those of their families to be so disrupted.
Every citizen and resident of Syria has the right to give his or her opinion for the future of the country in which his or her child will live, but these opinions – different as they may be – should be respected.
Honest, fair, transparent and respectful debate should be our strategy for working together; this should be our moral code, our law – and for centuries this has been our Syria.
Today, we are experiencing a low point.
Despite the whole dark news that comes from Syria, I cannot be pessimistic.
Syrian Students for a better future.

Hoping for better Syria she expressed:
I very much hope that all the Syrian students are doing very well in their new colleges, and are keeping up the hard work so that we can continue to represent our country very well in all fields, and so that Syria will be proud of us always.
FRA unveils its report on violence against women in the EU.
Photo from the Facebook page of Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), used with permission.
On March 5, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) published the results of a survey on violence against women , the most comprehensive of its kind ever conducted.
Undertaken simultaneously throughout the region, it is the first time comparative data has been available by country on the kinds of violence women suffer in their families, at work, in public and on the Internet as well as the effect it has on their lives and the way in which victims respond to aggression.
The enormity of the problem is proof that violence against women does not just impact a few women only – it impacts on society every day.
Therefore, policy makers, civil society and frontline workers need to review measures to tackle all forms of violence against women no matter where it takes place.
Morten Kjaerum, Director of the FRA, speaking to the audience that attended the presentation of the report.
Poto from the FRA website used with permission.
Some of the conclusions of the survey include: 33% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15, while 5% have been raped.
55% of women have suffered some form of sexual harassment (unwelcome kissing, hugging or touching) since the age of 15.
75% of women in high level jobs or who are highly qualified have experience sexual harassment at some point in their lives.
11% of women have experienced inappropriate advances on social websites or have been subjected to sexually explicit emails or text (SMS) messages.
67% did not report the most serious incident of partner violence to the police or other organizations.
Surprisingly the countries with the highest percentage of victims of violence against women are in northern Europe: Denmark (52%), Finland (47%) and Sweden (46%), while Hungary (21%), Austria (20%) and Poland (19%) have much lower rates.
Spain, at 22%, is well below average:
Percentage of women, by EU member country, who say they have suffered "physical or sexual violence at the hands of their partner or non-partner since the age of 15."

It seems counter intuitive that Scandinavian countries, which have higher rates of gender equality should also have higher rates of violence against women.
Blanca Tapia, spokesperson for the FRA, explains in El diario newspaper this apparent contradiction:
In countries like Finland, Denmark, Sweden or France, it is culturally more acceptable to talk about violence against women, so women are more likely to denounce it.
Women in northern countries have greater gender awareness; they know they have the same rights as men and it is clear to them that there are certain things they do not have to put up with.
They don't let things get by them.
The report has generated controversy among Europeans.
Many doubt the veracity of the numbers and question what is really considered aggression.
The user DENUNCIAR left the following comment on the website of diario 20 minutos :
We already know how these feminist surveys work, if you argue over the TV remote it's considered macho violence
nothing new under the sun another headline designed to manipulate our minds during this golden age of feminazis
In the Público newspaper, chochialimmoomuelte commented:
One out of every five women doesn't know they have to report a rape to the police??
Saying "I don't love you" is macho violence??
Hugs are harassment??
"Violence against women" occurs "everywhere every day"??
Of course, it gets harder and harder to justify subsidizing your feminazi soap box.
Intelligent women should be offended by this crap that is published and that treats them like they were idiots.
Madame X responded this way to the skeptics on the same webpage:
Of course a crude comment is a form of aggression.
It is humiliating to have something crude said to you, and humiliation is a form of mistreatment.
Any guy would be offended if another said something disgusting to their girlfriend, mother or sister—are you going to deny that?
So if it offends or bothers you went it is directed at a woman you care about, how can some of you actually have the nerve to question whether the woman feels harassed?
On Twitter, Lau published an image that explains in graphic detail the different kinds of violence committed against women:
And I am not just referring to those of us who are slapped in the face or raped.
Macho violence has a framework.
Don Mitxel Erregea questions the role of religions:
I wonder if macho violence has something to do with encouraging religions that associate women with Evil.
In Spain, cuts made by the current government affect public programs that protect women :
eliminates the "unfair treatment" offense that is usually the first step in cases of abuse; mediation is suggested in cases of violence against women.
This would put victims at risk and seeks to impose only a fine on the aggressor.
In Spain, 48 victims of violence against women died in 2013.
So far in 2014, 14 women have been killed by their partners.
With 5 million people, or 10.6% of the total population, Colombia has the largest Afro-descendant population in Latin America, behind only Brazil, according to a 2005 census.
There are, however, serious difficulties in quantifying blackness, given the mixed ethnic backgrounds of many Colombians.
The stigma associated with African descent in much of the country leads mixed-race individuals to identify away from their Afro roots, and unofficial figures place the Afro-Colombian community at as high as 25% of the total population.
Maren Soendergaard in Colombia Reports writes about political exclusion of afro-descendants in Colombia, stating that "a historic lack of political representation in Colombia’s political system is one of the key focuses in the ongoing social, political and economic struggle of the Afro-Colombian community."

In rural Peru, women are encouraged to spend their last weeks of pregnancy in special residential facilities that offer comfort and care.
But the waiting remains difficult.
To prevent women from giving birth at home, where they face a higher risk of death, Peru has established a network of maternal "waiting houses."
These residential facilities host women from rural areas during their final weeks of pregnancy, so they can give birth in the presence of skilled attendants.
Ana María Bolege, 21, has come to a waiting house in the Andean town of Ayacucho, three hours by road from her home.

The Campaign in Support of Syrians facing Racism (Arabic: الحملة الداعمة للسوريين بوجه العنصريّة) was launched on the 21st of March, 2014, on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, "in rejection of all violence towards Syrians , racist political rhetoric and the associated media hype."
In other words, it aims to tackle what is perceived as growing discrimination against Syrian refugees living in Lebanon.
Lebanese politicians are being accused by activists of using rising tensions between Syrians refugees and Lebanese inhabitants of some areas of Lebanon for politically-motivated purposes.
After the "I am not a Martyr" campaign in honor of Mohammad Chaar and the "I am not naked" campaign first in support of Olympic skier Jackie Chamoun and then against Domestic Violence, the anti-racism campaign is using the same (and now-familiar) method of online protest featuring average citizens posting selfies and carrying a message.
Speaking to leading French language Lebanese newspaper "L'Orient-le Jour", one of the activists participating in the campaign said:
Politicians can't even solve basic problems such as of providing us electricity and public transportation, stopping violence in Tripoli and Hermel, domestic violence, expensive telecommunication... These problems existed before the arrival of Syrian refugees and our politicians did not solve them. They never want to solve anything, they never did.
Here are a few examples of those participating:
"And our house is your house if you're willing to accept us parents to parents, brothers to brothers
I once met a Syrian who made us both proud
Above: The Humanist.
Below: The Racist
He didn't escape death to die of humiliation
Not every Syrian is a criminal and not every Lebanese is innocent
The Syrian refugee is like us: he can't live.
Direct your anger towards the corrupt ruling class.
I'm a human before being a Syrian.
Say no to racism.
Lebanon is a small country, but with a big heart.
90% of our houses are built by Syrians.
Stay a racist and leave your house.
Some even went further to criticize colonial legacy.
Whoever divided these grounds for 'immigrants' to cross borders to another country... I won't say 'welcome' because this is not just my country.
And they even hanged a sign over a highway:
Dear Syrian, Welcome!
Welcome to the heart of Lebanon
Journalist, photographer and blogger Meg at Life in Lanka blog reports that in remote Sri Lankan villages some women do not have a say in what type of contraception they use.
Their husbands were not keen on using condoms and preferred that their wives used contraception instead; so the inexpensive, easily available and quite effective condom for men was not an option, leaving contraception entirely up to the women.
Due to the fact that contraceptives for women usually have side effects their sufferings never end.
Human rights and ethics advocate Frederic Jacobs notes that the number of people using Tor is on the rise in Turkey:
Turkey has just banned Twitter.
Amnesty International has released a report which documents "allegations of human rights violations and abuses committed in the context of the massive public demonstrations since early February."
“The country runs the risk of descending into a spiral of violence unless steps are taken to bring the conflicting parties around the table.
This can only happen if both sides fully respect human rights and the rule of law.
Unless this happens, the death toll will continue to rise with ordinary people bearing the brunt,” said Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
According to the report, 37 people have died and over 550 have been injured:
According to figures released by the Office of the Attorney General on 27 March 2,157 have been detained during the protests.
The vast majority has been released but continue to face charges.
You can read the complete report in the Spanish-language version of the Amnesty International website.
Access to water is a human right; Source: actionaid.org with permission
Mustapha Sesay, West Africa Water Integrity Ambassador wrote about corruption in the water sector on the West Africa WASH Journalists Network :
The issue of accessing pure and affordable water is a fundamental human right but this is not given the much needed attention.
Corruption in the water sector is ripe and involves all classes of people ranging from the ordinary man, politicians, Heads of Water Institutions and even Non-Governmental organizations working in this sector.Report on “Corruption in the water sector” by Water Integrity Network in a book titled “Training Manual on Water Integrity” states that in the sub-Sahara Africa, forty-four percent (44 %) of the countries are unlikely to attain the Millennium Development Goal target for drinking water eighty-five percent (85%) are unlikely to attain the sanitation aspect.
Estimate by the World Bank report suggests that twenty –forty percent (20 – 40% ) of water sector finances are being lost to dishonest practices.
Tunisian award-winning collective blog Nawaat has launched its own whistle-blowing platform: Nawaat Leaks.
The secure platform was launched in collaboration with GlobaLeaks, an open source and anonymous whistleblowing software.
GlobaLeaks announced the new project in a tweet on March 27:
Nawaat Leaks Logo Those wishing to use Nawaat Leaks to leak classified information, will first need to download the online anonymity software Tor.
Nawaat co-founder Sami Ben Gharbia explains the online safety measures taken into consideration to protect the platform's users :
In collaboration with GlobaLeaks, the Nawaat team created a special page that deploys a number of open source applications and techniques which protect those leaking confidential documents and files.
This software even protects whistleblowers from the Nawaat team itself, which thanks to these techniques will not be able to identify the identity of those who leak through their address emails, IP addresses, names or their geographic locations.
To provide them with further protection, the Nawaat team will as usual and before the publication of any leaked confidential document, delete all meta data which increases the possibility of identifying the electronic source of documents in its different formats: audio, video clips, photos or texts
In 2011, Tunisia's interim authorities passed decree 41 guaranteeing access to administrative documents.
In practice, however, the law is far from being implemented.
In a statement published on March 27, Article 19 slammed the authorities' ineffective implementation of decree 41.
ARTICLE 19 "notes concern that existing measures designed to ensure government transparency are not being effectively implemented" the organization said.
Ben Gharbia comments on the decree's lack of proper implementation:
Despite decree 41 of 2011, which theoretically guarantees citizens' right to access administrative documents held by public institutions and despite the multiple talks on fighting corruption and holding the corrupt accountable and the need to establish a transparent good governance , we are yet to enjoy the right to access information and a serious anti corruption battle.
But, on the contrary, we have witnessed how those who seek to uncover hidden corruption, favoritism, abuse of power and other aspects which still devour the worlds of politics, administration and business, are put on trial and prosecuted
Bob Marley has suddenly become a god among the already confused generation. The Rastafari Flag, with either Bob himself or with a marijuana leave on it, is all over the place.

Passang Tshering, a Bhutanese blogger and computer teacher at the Bajothang Higher Secondary School, Bhutan, wonders why Bob Marley is considered iconic among the Bhutanese youth today.

Local authorities in Lanzhou have warned residents against drinking tap water due to an outbreak of severe pollution in its water supply, prompting scenes of frantic bottled water purchases across the city's supermarkets.
An excessive amount of benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, has been detected in the city's water supply system, according to the local government.
At one point, the benzene found in the tap water had spiked to a dangerous level 20 times what is considered to be safe.
Lanzhou, an industrial city in northwestern China, depends largely on the Yellow River for its water supply.
In recent years, this city of four million has seen a wave of investment frenzy as the state rolled out various initiatives to lift the economic standing of the underdeveloped western regions.
Lanzhou residents snatched up bottled water after the local government issued warnings not to drink tap water.

French water treatment company Veolia, the main water supplier in Lanzhou, told state-run Xinhua news agency that the polluted water might be caused by local petrochemical companies.
The information office in Gansu province, where Lanzhou is the capital city, posted this message on its official account on Twitter-like Sina Weibo:
Tap water is not suitable for Lanzhou residents to drink during the next 24 hours.
Starting from 3 a.m. April 11, Lanzhou Veolia has put activated carbon into the company's sedimentation tanks to absorb organic material in an effort to dissolve the benzene.
At 11 a.m. April 11, it suspended operation of the northern ditch facilities to get rid of the benzene-polluted water.
During this time, water in the urban area of the city will be provided via depressurisation technics, but the water supply in Gaoping district and remote areas will be suspended.
Water use in factories will be restrained.
In the next 24 hours, running water will not be suitable for drinking, and other kinds of water will not be affected.
Local media reported that Lanzhou residents had complained about smelly tap water last month, but city officials claimed the water quality was up to standards.
A number of residents who spread the word of contamination back then were labeled as "rumour-mongers" and "dealt with" according to law.
The water crisis in Lanzhou underscores the runaway pollution that has transfixed the nation as grassroots environmental activism begins to gain traction in China.
In 2013, a prominent blogger and former journalist initiated an online campaign calling for netizens to snap photos of polluted rivers in their hometown.
Lanzhou water contamination was one of the top three trending topics on Weibo as of Friday night.
The Beijing news offered this update on its official Weibo account:
【The pollution source has been cut off.
Government will offer free safe water】 Lanzhou city's emergency team has narrowed down the pollution source and ordered it to be cut off.
Relevant departments have been gathering bottled water and buckets of water from neighbouring areas, and these will be handed to residents via different administrative departments and organizations.
Weibo users criticized the government for allowing a non-Chinese company to manage the city's water systems.
Comedian artist Zhang Gang complained:
I call on the Lanzhou government to collect safe drinking water and give it for free to citizens! It needs to give an accurate and direct answer! How embarrassing the continuous water pollution is to common folks.
Can we have faith in water supply companies controlled by foreigners?
Who decided to sell the water supply company to the French? Who did it? And who signed off on it?
Beijing Chuzi, a Weibo user with over half a million followers, wrote:
This is the stupidest thing the government has done.
It hands over to foreigners when it supposedly should be government-run.
I suspect somebody might have profited from the deal.

This is a fascinating love story between Sam from Kibera, a slum in the city of Nairobi, Kenya and Alissa from Minnesota, USA:
This has to be the love story of the year!!!!!
So how did these two lovebirds come to meet?
Alissa had come to Kenya and for several months she had been working with the people living in Kibera.
For several months as she took the Matatu (Public transport) home she would spot Sam, a young talented man who ran his own Africanised jewellery store just by the road side.
One fine day, as Sam was having a banana next to his shop, he spotted a beautiful white lady seated on the right hand side of the Matatu.
He was mesmerised by what he saw and with the last remaining 5 shillings that he had in his pocket, he decided to buy her a banana too.
So he asked the nice lady at the shop for another banana and went to give it to the beautiful lady that he had just spotted.
Luck was not on his side, since as soon as he got to the window next to where she sat, the matatu sped off.
He ran after it but it was too late, the matatu had left and so had the girl of his dreams.

Massive book giveaway in Havana (Photo Fernando Medina)
Dozens of people gathered in a park in Havana, the Cuban capital, last Sunday to participate in a massive book giveaway.
The initiative, led by blogger and Global Voices author Rafael González , focused on leaving books somewhere in the park with an inscription on the first page that read: "This book belongs to whoever finds it in exchange for giving it away again after reading it so that other people can enjoy it."
The original initiative, started on Facebook , was taken up by González, who contacted the creators.
Lu Di Piertro commented in regard to this:
This idea is not ours, it has already existed for some time and I don't know who started it exactly.
A friend, Rodri, who is also an organizer for this event thought to put together a massive giveaway and proposed to me that we do this event and it was very pleasantly accepted.
(The event) seems good to us for many reasons (...): the importance of reading, the beauty of giving, the excitement of releasing, and the uncertainty of not knowing and trusting; encouraging solidarity and the spirit of sharing socially and culturally, opening your heart and crossing borders.
Meanwhile, another organizer, Rodri Bristot, added:
Personally, what drives me to organize this Massive Giveaway event, has to do with an idea that is a bit romantic: I believe that there are things in live that should be free, like education and reading; books should not only be for those who can pay for them, they should be more accessible, people should find them in public spaces without having to give something up (money or work) to acquire them.
Several bookmarks were shared during the event (Photo Fernando Medina)
On the morning of Sunday, April 6, González, along with a group of about 50 youths, adults and children, gave away their books in H y 21 Park, located in El Vedado, Havana.
People looked behind the benches in the park, searched the roundabout in the center between the roots of the trees, and even approached newcomers to get books firsthand.
Cuban writer Dazra Novak described the experience from her blog :
I gave away four books today - with the month, year, and city listed on the first page -, I hope that the recipients enjoy themselves as much as I did when reading two of these books, and as much as I did when I wrote the other two.
I don't know why I suspect that at some point they will come back to me so that I can send them off again.
Now that I think about it, today - tomorrow, always - everyone should do the same.

A group of politicians in South Africa are pushing voters to boycott large political parties come election day.
Former South African intelligence minister Ronnie Kasrils, former South African Communist Party leader Vishwas Satgar and former deputy health and defence minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge launched their "Vukani!
Sidikwe!
(Wake Up! We Are Fed up!)
Vote No" campaign in Johannesburg on April 15, 2014.
The campaign calls on South African voters to vote for small parties during May 7 elections or simply write "No" on the ballot.
According to Business Day Live, the campaign has attracted high-profile signatories, such as former director-general of environmental affairs Horst Kleinschmidt, former vice-chancellor of the University of South Africa Barney Pityana, and award-winning cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro.
It is supported by organisations such as the Awethu Platform, the Democratic Left Front and Democracy From Below.
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) is facing its toughest test in this year's elections due to rising cost of living, unemployment and corruption scandals.
The main challengers are the main opposition party Democratic Alliance (DA) and Electronic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the radical leftist party formed by the former ANC youth leader Julius Malema.
South Africa netizens appeared deeply divided about the campaign on Twitter.
Ronnie Kasrils is at pains to reinvent himself.
Nigeria is at war with Boko Haram, an Islamic jihadist terrorist movement based in northeast Nigeria, northern Cameroon and Niger that is responsible for thousands of deaths in the last several years. In recent weeks, the group has intensified their campaign of slaughtering innocent and hapless Nigerians.
Last week, members killed over a dozen students who were travelling to write their pre-university entrance examination in Borno State.
Boko Haram is suspected to be behind a bus station bomb blast in Nyanya in the capital Abuja, which left more than 70 people killed.
A few days ago, the group abducted about 100 girls from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, about 130 kilometers west of Maiduguri in northeast Nigeria.
Last year, Boko Haram opened fire on students at the College of Agriculture in Yobe state, gunning down dozens of students aged 18 to 22 while they slept in a dormitory.
A timeline of the organization's killings from 2012 is detailed in this post.
Many Nigerian netizens, shocked by these latest crimes, have blamed President Goodluck Jonathan for the deteriorating security situation in the country:
While The Federal Government and its security chiefs have perfected how to write condolence speeches, BOKO HARAM continues to grow.. — Aaliyah (@TalesMallory) April 16, 2014
Others think the president is not doing enough:
Boko Haram does as it pleases and the President is busy making silly campaign speeches.
The irresponsibility, the rascality is unbelievable! — Malcolm O. Ifi, Esq. (@saymalcolm) April 16, 2014
@toluogunlesi praised Nigeria's National Security Adviser Colonel Sambo Dasuki:
To his credit Dasuki launched impressive anti-terror strategy last month.

One Twitter user called for the slaughter of all Boko Haram members:
Murder is the only acceptable resolution in this case. Every single member of Boko Haram should be slaughtered. — #Kayode (@Unkle_K) April 16, 2014
Horror for the killing and anguish for the victims:
i still don't understand how boko haram abducted 200 girls from a school, i'm still just spinning — Apollonian (@jvson_) April 16, 2014
# BokoHaram upducting 100 girls is an abomination.
Goodluck Jonathan must now declare full scale military war on BokoHaram.
Wipe them out. — Alphayo Nyakundi (@AlphayoNyakundi) April 16, 2014
@onigabby1 wondered if Nigeria still exists:
Is Nigeria still Nigeria?
Or federal republic of boko haram.
My condolence to victim of the bomb blast. — ONI GABRIEL (@onigabby1) April 16, 2014
What is the solution?:
"@9ja_travel: solution to this Boko haram terrorism?"There is really no solution, d spate of their activities can only be reduced. — kolawole olawole (@kholarr_ola) April 16, 2014
@LovBwise urged activists to protest:
Twitter activists can we please protest this weekend against the sponsors of boko haram? — MaXiNze (@LovBwise) April 16, 2014
@opinion_river took a measured stance:
President Goodluck Jonathan did not create Boko-Haram.
The sect existed before his coming into power.
But he has not done enough to crush it — opinion_river (@opinion_river) April 16, 2014
Some called for prayer:
Please let take 5 minutes between 12-12.05noon to say this Prayer:- GOD send help to the defenceless girls abducted by Boko Haram in Borno — Mz.
Damie (@queensaldam) April 16, 2014
While others called for more than prayer:
So while praying for those plagued by Boko Haram, strategy MUST come forth from the place of prayer. #noxveritas — Abdul Masih (@damilar3) April 16, 2014

Ocean Shield deploys the Bluefin 21 underwater vehicleOfficial U.S. Navy Flickr Page Australia’s current Prime Minister Tony Abbott is not alone in courting international celebrity status.
His predecessor Kevin Rudd loved a global audience.
However, the PM’s recent foray into the politically dangerous waters of aircraft search and recovery has attracted many local cynics and critics.
The hunt for missing Malaysian airliner MH370 has been taking place in the ocean to the west of Perth.
With the world’s media watching during his visit to China, Abbott gleefully announced on 12 April 2014 that:
We are confident that we know the position of the black box flight recorder to within some kilometres, but confidence in the approximate position of the black box is not the same as recovering wreckage from almost four-and-a-half kilometres beneath the sea.
The Chinese were particularly interested as the majority of the passengers are from China.
It was a big call that he seemed to backing away from when he spoke to the media on 28 April:
Many saw it as a back down:
Not afraid of some more hyperbole, the PM persevered at his media conference:
A thread soon emerged on twitter alleging an attempt to distract the local audience from damaging scandals concerning his own Liberal Party colleagues at the Independent Commission of Corruption in New South Wales.
The resignation of the State Premier the previous week has been followed by more political heads rolling over money laundering.
Tony Abbott is prepared to put his money where his machismo is, but some think it’s a waste:
The search area is once again being widened, as the world watches with increasing disbelief:
With the aim of collecting 3,000 signatures, the association MujeresMundi just launched a petition in the online platform Change.org requesting the Peruvian State a reconstruction of the historical memory in the voice of the victims of sterilizations:
second period of the government of Alberto Fujimori; it was implemented the National Program on Reproductive Health and Family Planning policy aimed at reducing the overall fertility rates.
The most recent investigation involved the cases of some 2,000 women.
However, statistics and documents show that around 300 000 rural Peruvian women were pressured into being sterilized during this period.
The new president of Madagascar Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president on December 20, 2013.
A few months later, he's yet to name a prime minister for his new government.
Many observers wonder what is taking so long.
Malagasy blogger Michael Rakotoarison has a different take on the situation; he argues that maybe the president taking his time is not such a bad thing :
I was one of of skeptical ones especially since I have never shown any support for this President .
However a reliable source told me that the President has currently commissioned a handful of men to discreetly identify people who possess specific skill sets.
The challenge is to get rid of the political side of the equation and to focus on the economy.
As Rwanda pays tribute to the victims of the genocide 20 years after the tragedy, President Kagame states again that France must "face up to the difficult truth" of its role in the 1994 genocide .
As a result of this statement, France has pulled out of the commemorative events and former Foreign Affairs Minister of France demands that president Hollande defends the Honor of France and its army.
Rémi Noyon at French site Rue 89 lists the reasons why Rwanda accuses again France of aiding the genocide :
1) France commanded some branches of the Rwandan army against the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).
2) France feared that the Tutsi offensive was remotely piloted via Uganda by anglophone countries and was intended to drive a wedge into the influence of France in the region.
3) France did not seem overly interested in peace negotiations before the conflict.
4) The soldiers did not evacuate any of the Tutsi staff present at the Embassy of France (except for one person).
They ended all being killed.
5) As for Operation Turquoise, it continues to divide: it certainly saved Tutsi lives, but the army is accused of having remained passive - and therefore was accomplice - to the atrocities.
An Egyptian activist has turned to YouTube to spell out his objection to the mandatory military service in the Egyptian army, compulsory for men aged between 18 and 30.
In an email sent to Global Voices Online, Adam writes:
In this video, subtitled in English, Ahmed (Adam) says:
I am Ahmad (aka Adam) from Egypt.
I'll talk to you about mandatory conscription in Egypt.
I am totally against mandatory conscription, I refuse to serve in Egyptian Army because it is a criminal army which killed thousands of protesters and innocent people in Mohamed Mahmoud Street and Tahrir Square in Cairo and many regions in Egypt.
He adds:
The mandatory conscription is humiliation, enslavement, and forced labour to thousands of poor Egyptians who get conscripted every year to work in the private businesses and farms of Egyptian army generals without any pay or salary.
Any any Egyptian soldier served in the army knows very well how large credits the army generals own in their bank accounts.
Also, army generals own lots of real-estate property obtained in an illegal way.
They rob the country's wealth and assets.
Adam explains:
Mandatory conscription is not found in any developed country, any Western country, nor the USA.
Residents of Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital city, woke up on Wednesday, April 16, 2014 to the news that the image of Jesus Christ had appeared in a home in the Odza neighborhood.
This sparked mass hysteria as the faithful and the curious flocked to the neighborhood to see the Easter miracle for themselves.
A few days later, Mgr. Samuel Kleda, the Archbishop of Douala, dismissed the alleged apparition as a hoax, but this did little to dampen the enthusiasm of the faithful who continued to throng to the home of Amougui Minkan.
Some even scaled the fence around the house to avoid the long lines.
News of the apparition instantly became a trending topic in Cameroon on Twitter where users tweeted about the claim with incredulity and levity.
Blogger @ngimbis questioned what exactly people were seeing on the wall:
Man!
You will need celestial telescopic sights to see him, right?
Many found it hilarious that Jesus would choose to appear in Cameroon of all places:
That Jesus is back ?? lol even if Jesus gonna come back it can't be in Cameroon...Nopeeee!**** — IG:adamiby (@adam_ib_rahim) April 17, 2014
The fact that the apparition occurred in Odza, which is next to Nsimalen, a neighborhood where there was an apparition of Mary, Jesus' mother, in May 1986 was not lost on many:
Apparently, Jesus and his mother have moved into two neighborhoods that are next to each other.
Cameroon is blessed
@ntrjack could not resist going back to the age old debate about Jesus’ race:
So Jesus is white even in apparitions.
This settles the debate
And @lesikanel teased:
I am still waiting for someone to post a selfie with Jesus at Odza
To some, the apparition was an opportunity for some social and political commentary.
For @TjatBass, Jesus appearing in Yaounde was of no consequence:
Jesus really loves Cameroon!
But there is still misery, lots of injustice and many people are dying.
@ngimbis on the other hand reminded Cameroonians that President Paul Biya had still not been seen or heard from since he attended the Africa-EU summit in Brussels on April 2-3, 2014:
If he is found, Jesus of Odza will serve as the interim for our president who has been missing since the EU summit.
Business has been booming in Odza since the apparition.
Not wanting to be left behind, the owners of the home where Jesus is said to have appeared are now asking for donations:
Jesus the son of God appeared in Yaounde, Cameroon during Holy Week.
In a house.
There’s now an admission fee.
A week after the legend of Jesus of Odza began, many are still making the pilgrimage to Odza while the debate about the authenticity of the apparition rages on.
In the meantime, the dominant view seems to be this one colorfully expressed by @Difredsimpson:
Writing for Southeast Asia Globe, Denise Hruby reported how the mentally ill in many rural areas of Cambodia are being treated:
...the mentally ill are still treated by traditional healers, who aim to drive out bad spirits by burning the skin, or by the untrained staff of one-room health clinics who prescribe everything from pain-relief tablets to cough syrup.
According to government spokesperson Phay Siphan, mental health is not a priority:
The government prioritises maternal health and malaria.
For mental health, I know that other governments have the money to subsidise that, but we are poor.

In Macedonia, as in other countries of the former Yugoslavia, the tradition of collecting stickers is decades long, dating back at least to the 1970s and many vintage sticker albums are now valued collectors' items.
Adults participate in the exchange almost as much as children and popular brands have included Italian Panini and Croatian Kraš (Animal Kingdom).
In 2006, local programmer Goran Slakeski founded the website slikicki.com which has been the center of an online sticker exchange community, extending its reach with occasional offline events such as this one.

A spirited discussion with: Sana Saleem, Ivan Sigal and Solana Larsen.﻿
In the early days of blogging, Iran's reformist bloggers were widely celebrated in international media.
The country was youthful, internet savvy and early to innovate with online political dialogue.
Lately, things are more quiet.
Iran is famously heavy handed when it comes to censorship and repression.
Have Persian bloggers been silenced?
Or is what appears to be a gradual decline in blogging simply because of social media and changing norms?

While neighboring Rwanda is making news with the commemoration of the 1994 genocide and the increased tension with France, Burundi is marred in an overlooked political crisis and surge of violence that opposes, again, Hutus and Tutsis.
Tshitenge Lubabu in Burundi opines that the roots of the crisis are the current political leaders:
Most of our leaders, properly elected or not, despite long years in power, stand out by their incompetence Any lies are good to seize or stay in power.
When their mandates come to an end as stipulated in the Constitution, their overzealous entourage, never sated, beg them not to leave power.

Lauri writes about a project in South Africa, FunDza Literacy Trust, that takes advantage of mobile phone technology to encourage reading among kids:
What I find lovely, though, is when Africans sort out innovative solutions to their problems.
FunDza Literacy Trust is one such solution.
Cellphones have taken off big in Southern Africa and FunDza has latched on to that to get kids reading.
I'm proud to be writing regularly for them.
How it works is a story begins on a Friday.
Each story has seven chapters and one chapter goes out on the kids' cellphones each day.
Here is my author's page with all of the stories I've written at FunDza.
Click on any story and see the comments the readers leave.
The kids are reading and seriously engaging with the stories!
I think this is wonderful!
Gershom Ndhlovu argues that Africa leaders are making a mistake by blaming the West for Africa's problem:
At the last EU-Africa Summit held in Belgium, Zambia's president Michael Chilufya Sata reiterated what other African leaders had said in the past about the West contributing to wars on the continent through the sale of guns and other military hardware.
Quoted by Eil D’Afrique, Sata told the gathering that Africa had no gun factory that fuels conflict and that Europe was responsible for conflicts on the continent because weapons used in conflicts are manufactured in Western countries.
"Most poor child soldiers involved in conflicts in Africa carry guns manufactured in Europe that cost thousands of dollars.
These poor children could not have money to buy these weapons," said Sata.
In its post-independence existence, Africa has had its fair share of coups and counter-coups and civil wars.
Of course, most of these were brewed in smoky backrooms where Western diplomats met military officers while sipping on expensive wines and spirits, enticing them with not only the control of national resources if they kicked out an anti-Western radical leader but also the support of their capital.
This is how megalomaniac tyrants like Mobutu Sese Seko rose to power and maintained a hold on it.
But to blame all or most of the recent conflicts in Africa on Western countries and European gun factories is being disingenuous and burying heads in the sand, ostrich-like.
It is pathetic that African countries still blame their former colonial masters today for their economic failures clearly caused by corruption, mismanagement and sheer incompetence
Iranian blogger Siamak Mehr was arrested in 2010 and is serving a 4-year sentence
Mohammad Reza Pourshajari, a jailed blogger known by his pen name Siamak Mehr, wrote an open letter from prison where he spoke of torture and extremely difficult conditions in prison.
The letter, dated March 6, 2014 was widely republished by many websites at the end of March.
The 52-year old blogger is serving a 4-year sentence in Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj, which is north-west of Tehran.
He was arrested on September 12, 2010 on charges of insulting the Prophet and enmity towards God in his blog posts.
In the letter, Pourshajari wrote:
... as soon as I was arrested in my apartment by security forces, I was tortured, beaten and threatened to be executed...
At the end of the letter, he invites the international community and governments who care for human rights to help Iranian people win their rights and freedom.
She said:
The authorities are refusing the transfer of Mr. Pourshajari to a medical facility and are depriving him of all his medications, in the hope that he will soon die.
To , the doctors' opinions are of no importance; they completely ignore them.... All Iranians are forced to obey and do whatever pleases the system.
A Facebook page has been launched to support the jailed blogger, with a copies of his letters and updates on his situation.
Here is a video, uploaded in December 2011, showing Siamak Mehr in chains, apparently on his way to court.
Syrian father Wael Zain claims his British son, aged five, is stranded in Syria and that the British Foreign Office is not helping reunite them.
Photograph shared on Twitter.
Wael Zain, a Syrian living and working in London, has turned to Twitter to draw attention to the plight of his five-year-old son, Maudh, who holds a British nationality, and who has been stranded in Syria for three years.
In a series of tweets, Zain explains that his son, whom he claims was recently shot at, is with his mother in a village in Deraa, and needs medical attention.
He also claims that the British Foreign Office has turned a deaf ear to his ordeal.
Originally from Deraa, Syria, Zain tweets:
He explains:

Yellow ribbons tied along a Seoul street in the hope of miracles following the Sewol ferry disaster.
Photo by Lee Yoo Eun.
It's been 14 days since a South Korean ferry capsized with several hundred people on board.
Now, 205 people are confirmed dead, with 97 people still missing.
The captain and entire crew of the ferry have since been arrested.
Prime Minister Chung Hong-won has resigned amid criticism of the government's delayed response to the disaster.
Three people from the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon office have been arrested and accused of destroying evidence.
As details of the South Korean government's botched handling of the sinking were revealed, anger has grown.
Online, users have taken aim at authorities and mainstream conservative media for merely parroting the government's excuses:
The government's abysmal risk management skills, their incompetence and lies, and the media that keeps lying non-stop... All of this has enraged the victims' families.
In the wake of the Sewol ferry disaster, this country's rock bottom has been revealed.
The president has vanished from the news.
The concerned government authorities' gaffes and numerous mistakes and other failures have disappeared from media reports.
Just like how in the sinking ferry Sewol, the ship's captain escaped first.
The media shows footage of devices deployed at the Sewol shipwreck scene and clips of experts during the rescue operation.
It seems like the operation is actively under way - if we only look at the media.
However, there are no additional survivors besides those initially rescued at the accident scene.
There is no progress, but the media keep blabbing.
The real scene is totally different than what the media shows.
Outrage has further been stoked by politicians taking advantage of the calamity.
A governing Saeunri party lawmaker is under fire for wrongfully accusing a victim's parent of being an outsider "who wants to stir up turmoil and grudges against the government".
The lawmaker later explained that she was misled by fake images shared online.
And police are now investigating a writer who wrote on Facebook that the "Sewol ferry disaster is a scene directed by Pro-North Korean sympathizers who want to spread confusion and chaos in South Korean society."
Now the tactic of branding people "red commies" and "Pro-North " has become a daily thing.
How outrageous is this situation?
Everyone accuses the other of being "Pro-North" or "North Korean spies" whenever there is a disagreement.
Those people who haven't given up the slightest bit of hope in the Sewol rescue operation, those people are very vulnerable and can easily be hurt by such comments.
Watch what you say.
As the whole country is being engulfed in despair and voices that are critical of the government grow stronger, the governing party and their supporters have started wielding the "Pro-North" rhetoric.
This environment made me think about what has lead the country into this kind of disaster.
If we cant change the leadership which covers up every flaw with the "Pro-North" tactic, we have no answer.

Balik Cina is a new website which compiles some of the hilarious and notorious quotes made by Malaysian politicians.
Most of the quotes featured on the site were submitted by netizens.
The quotes are linked to a news source which provides details and context of a particular issue.
Balik Cina is actually an infamous quote in Malaysia.
Here’s the reason why the website is named Balik Cina:
Balik Cina literally means 'go back to China' in Bahasa Malaysia.
The term Balik Cina was first popularized by the principal of a Shah Alam high school in July 2013.
This term and other phrases of similar sophistication has since been trending in Malaysia.
Inspired by the outstanding quality of public discourse perpetuated by Malaysian politicians, we started BalikCina.com to keep track of all exciting developments in our political landscape.
Balik Cina aspires to be the finest collection of all beautiful and inspirational quotes by Malaysian politicians and public figures.
Aizyl Azlee of The New Forward reviews the website and confirms that Malaysian politicians often spew out ridiculous statements:
Malaysian politicians say ridiculous stuff so often that most of us can barely keep up.
Before we’re done laughing at one quote, there’s already another one going viral on the internet.
So much so that we aren’t exactly able to remember half of what we’ve laughed at.
Below are eight examples of some of the memorable and shocking sound bites by Malaysian politicians in recent years:
1
He has since then apologized for his remarks but he blamed the media for misquoting him.
2
Prime Minister Najib Razak, the most prominent and active social media user in Malaysia, posted a photo of his meeting with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
But he probably thought he was at the Twitter HQ.
3
Aside from V-necks, the guidelines warned that “a preference for tight and bright coloured clothes” is an indicator of homosexuality.
4
Last month, an independent online website was denied permit for publication because of this reasoning:
5
Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim probably assumed he could use the MH370 disaster to further undermine the credibility of the ruling government.
It backfired.
6
An MP wants to censor the Internet to appease the Chinese relatives of missing Malaysian plane MH370.
He blamed the unregulated media information as source of anger of the relatives.
7
Those sanitary pads must be the source of all bloody evils in the world.

Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, has a law that bans non-Muslims from using the word Allah to refer to the Christian God.

Public domain photo belonging to U.S. Air Force.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has angered Nigeria with comments made on March 15, 2014 during his 90th birthday luncheon that Nigeria and its citizens are corrupt.
Mugabe asked, "Are we now like Nigeria where you have to reach into your pocket to get anything done?
You see, we used to go to Nigeria and every time we went there we had to carry extra cash in our pockets to corruptly pay for everything.
You get into a plane in Nigeria and you sit there and the crew keeps dilly dulling without taking off as they wait for you to pay them to fly the plane."
The Nigerian government summoned Zimbabwe's envoy last week over Mugabe's remarks.
However, the Coalition Against Corrupt Leaders (CACOL) in Nigeria has asked the federal government to deal with the message and not the messenger.
The 2013 Transparency International Corruption Index shows the level of perceived corruption to be higher in Zimbabwe than in Nigeria.
Mugabe's comments have received mixed reactions on Twitter.
Some netizens argued that what he said is the truth:

I am Nigerian but I do not see any wrong in calling a spade a spade. — Almustapha Zubairu. (@mustybnzubair) April 11, 2014
looooool if mugabe can open his mouth to call nigeria corrupt ...then its obvious we have a problem...very huge problem! — Zainab.K (@MayowaKay) April 14, 2014
@figure007 felt that although Mugabe said the truth, he has no moral justification:
Just Read what Robert Mugabe said about nigeria,though he said d truth,but he has no Moral Justification 2 say it as a sitting president — Abiodun Olumide (@figure007) April 12, 2014
Others disagreed with his assessment of corruption in Nigeria:
high point of dramtic irony. mugabe tags nigeria as corrupt.lol. the devil we know is too young to deal with a 90 year old. — Qrriiss (@Qrriiss) April 13, 2014
What's that about taking the plank out of your own eye?
#Mugabe has the audacity to infer Nigeria Govt is #corrupt.
Pot calling the kettle black.
Both corrupt countries.

The Friedrich Ebert Foundation has published a research report on the use of social media in Cameroon:
To what extent, for what purposes and by whom are social media like Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, Linkedin, etc. used in the country?
To find answers to these questions, the Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation has commissioned a research report on the use of social media in Cameroon...
In terms of the popularity of social media, as elsewhere, Facebook is the single most popular social media tool in Cameroon.
Some Cameroonian Facebook groups have up to 20.000 followers and more.
More surprising is the strong popularity of Linkedin.
Close to 4 Cameroonian internet users out of ten have subscribed to the service, compared to only 3% in neighbouring Nigeria.
The search for jobs and employment opportunities may explain at least parts of this puzzle.
A quickly increasingly popular social media site is the microblogging service Twitter.
Cameroon is now among the top-ten African countries in terms of the tweeted volumes, though Tweeting is heavily concentrated on Douala and Yaoundé.
By comparison, blogging is still in an infant stage, given its exceedingly higher demands on time and content.
However, for what Cameroonian bloggers may lack in numbers, they more than make up for in terms of quality.
Some of Africa’s best blogs come from Cameroon, some of whom are organized in the “Collectif des Blogueurs Camerounais."
In addition, a number of innovations have already emerged that will no doubt accelerate the spread of social media, including the emergence of mobile money which now enables commercial activities.
No to April Fool's.

Despite warnings, that jumping on the April Fool's bandwagon would lead to an eternal hell as Muslims don't lie, many netizens across the Arab world, decided to use the day to criticise their governments.
From Saudi Arabia, Abdelrahman Al Kanhal jokes:
King Abdulla adopts two new projects to develop the judiciary and education
And adds:
The Kingdom takes serious measures to end traffic chaos
And in reference to the ban on women driving in the absolute monarchy, he writes:
Society itself decides on the right of women to drive.
And we don't oppose women driving but send them to jail if they do because society refuses their driving
Meanwhile, Egyptian Adham Morad lies about the return of ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi: Morsi is back!!
The government of Egypt decides to increase wages, support state subsides, increase the budget for education and health services and provide Egyptians with a decent living, freedom and social justice
From Bahrain, Ammar Al Aradi, tweets a series of April Fool's jokes, which some people took seriously.

A strong 8.2 earthquake hit northern Chile at 20:46 and generated a tsunami that triggered the alarms across the country as this video shows:
The epicenter was located 89kms Southeast of Cuya, in front of Tarapaca's coast.
Map: Epicenter of the 8.2 magnitude earthquake in Northern Chile
The government asked for an immediate evacuation of the entire coastline as the first waves hit Iquique.
In this Storify collection by Nacion.cl, there are several pictures of people moving to higher ground and some damages caused by the earthquake.
Some Twitter users shared important information, including the government's Emergency National Office (ONEMI):
During a Tsunami Alert, evacuate by foot and go the nearest meeting point.
Don't forget your pets, they should be evacuated with you.
Please #AlertaTsunami #Tsunami #Terremoto #Iquique #Arica
Others compared the government's response to the one during a major earthquake in 2010:
They learned from their mistakes: tsunami alert, evacuation and the army to the streets.
Finally, they put their pants on.

A powerful 8.3-magnitude earthquake hit northern Chile and southern Peru, as well as neighboring areas in Bolivia, during the early evening of Tuesday, April 1, 2014, triggering a tsunami warning for the coastline.
Six people died in Chile, including one Peruvian man.
In Peru, there were no reports of significant damage in the three cities where the temblor shook with the most intensity - Tacna, Moquegua and Arequipa.
Peruvians took to Twitter during and after the shaking.
There, some said the city of Tacna was without electricity due to electric poles falling over:
In the city of Tacna, the movement was strong, the city has no electric power.
A report from La Linterna Radio provided more details:
Report from Tacna as a result of the powerful earthquake felt seconds ago.
Reportedly, there was no electricity or mobile phone service in Moquegua:
Regions of Tacna and Moquegua without electricity. Movistar and Claro cellphone services have collapsed after the earthquake...
From Chile came reports of evacuation from cities along the northern coast in anticipation of a possible tsunami:
LATEST NEWS - Evacuation in northern Chile carried out calmly, according to our correspondent in Arica.
PICTURES: This is how Chile's coasts are being evacuating due to the tsunami alert.
Likewise, there was also an evacuation order in Peru for several cities in the south of the country:
URGENT: Order of evacuation for Peruvian coastline: Arequipa, Ica, Tacna.
URGENT - EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE: Peruvian authorities tell AFP that they are evacuating the population in the country's south.
URGENT - EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE: Access closed to the Costa Verde from San Miguel, Magdalena, San Isidro, Miraflores and Barranco in Lima.
The first tsunami waves were reported to be arriving to the coasts of Ilo and Tacna in southern Peru:
Tsunami waves arrive to La Punta Callao at 8:31 p.m., Ica at 7:39, Tacna and Moquegua already arriving.
Meanwhile in Chile, there were reports of aftershocks:
CHILE: At least five 5-magnitude aftershocks after powerful earthquake.
These are the countries with tsunami alert.
A powerful 6,1 earthquake hit Nicaragua on Thursday, April 10, 2014.
There were reports of injured people and collapsing of houses as a result of the movement.
The epicenter was located at 20 kilometers North of the capital city Managua, close to Apoyeque volcano, at 10 kilometers depth.
In Twitter, users reported aftersocks and suspension of school activities:
Five aftershocks after powerful 6,2 earthquake in Nicaragua: MANAGUA, Nicaragua.- At least...
Schools activities suspended in Managua and León due to the earthquake.

This story by April Peavy for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on April 7, 2014 and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content sharing agreement.
New parents everywhere face a common problem: getting their babies to sleep.
And there's a common solution: a lullaby.
But it turns out lullabies don't just help babies relax, they help adults, as well, explains author Kathy Henderson, who collected lullabies from across the globe for her children's book, Hush, Baby, Hush.
She says lullabies help parents "deal with the situation in which they are being wound up by a child, or they are failing to get them to sleep, or they are feeling really, really tired themselves."
The title of Henderson's book comes from a Jamaican lullaby called "Hush Baby Hush," with a version recorded by The Kitchen Sisters.
The author says lullabies share certain traits.
They almost always have both music and words.
The music has to have a "soothing rhythm" and a rather narrow musical range.
But the lyrics, she says, can be about anything — and cover a wide spectrum of human emotion and mood.
There are lullabies about anger, frustration, and humor.
Henderson points out there are lullabies about "food, families, monsters, children being naughty" and many other things.
Lullabies are also sung in all sorts of situations, not just when a baby is in bed. For example, mothers sometimes sing them while they work, so their children will settle down and let them keep on working.
Henderson reckons the oldest lullaby is from well before the common era and says researchers have found lullabies in the oldest-known literature.
PRI is collecting and sharing favorite lullabies from around the world in our new app, The World's Lullabies.

Egyptian blogger Nadia El Awady wrote a blog post in which she questions if women wearing Hijab face discrimination in western countries or not.
Nadia, as an Egyptian who grew up in the US and lived prolonged periods in Europe, adds from her personal experience in regards to reactions she received in both Eastern and Western countries when it comes to wearing the Hijab or even taking it off.
She writes:
During all those years, I have been without the hijab, with the hijab, wearing a very long hijab (called a khimar), wearing a face veil (called a niqab), back to wearing a shorter hijab and finally, now, no hijab at all.
I’ve done it all.
I’ve seen all the reactions.
The way I have dressed over the years may have been accepted by some in my inner circles and criticized by others; this is true.
How a woman dresses is a highly contentious subject no matter where you are in the world.
When I donned the face veil, my own father was against it.
When I took off my hijab, I lost at least one good friend and was tsk tsked by many others.
These are normal reactions and they are to be expected.
I do not categorize these reactions as discrimination.
Friends and family have definite ideas of how they expect me to live my life.
They believe they know what is best for me.
As a follow-up to her post about "the absurdity of cutting the budget for the College of The Bahamas", Blogworld says:
Not only is the College the national tertiary level institution, but it’s the only indigenous public institution that is engaged in any form of ongoing Bahamian research.
Ethiopians on Twitter are celebrating April Fool's day with fake news headlines that imitate the lies of state owned media.

A group of students at Iran's Amirkabir University in Tehran chanted pro-opposition slogans, held placards and waved the Iranian flag during a speech by failed conservative presidential candidate and former top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili on 14 April 2014.
The shouted slogans supported Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, leaders of the Green Movement protests that rocked the country following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's reelection in 2009 by a landslide.
Protesters considered the elections results fraudulent, and millions rallied for Ahmadinejad's removal.
But authorities began a widespread crackdown on the movement in early 2010, and Mousavi and Karroubi, both former presidential candidates, as well as Mousavi's wife Zahra Rahnavard were placed under house arrest on 14 February 2011.
Students at Amirkabir University chanted, "Our vote is for imam's prime minister," a reference to Mousavi, who was prime minister from 1980 to 1988 when Ruhollah Khomeini was in power as the country's supreme leader.
Meanwhile, conservative Basiji students sitting in the front rows, who support Jalili, chanted "down with the US."
They can be seen toward the end of the following YouTube video, which begins with pro-opposition students:
The main topic of Jalili's main topic was the country's nuclear achievements.
Alireza Taba tweeted that some of the protesting students faced university discipline afterward:
At least nine students who protested during Jalili's speech were called to disciplinary committee.
Hanif Z.Kashani reported:

On Twitter, user amirHP tweeted about the protests:
Jalili came for the nuclear day event but pro-Mousavi slogans are the dominating slogans.

It does not matter if it's Hassan or Hussein , the movement continues.

One week ahead of Macedonia's presidential elections, incumbent candidate President Gjorge Ivanov provoked widespread discussion among Macedonian social media users by making a series of gaffes in his first campaign interview.
Users quickly shared information about Ivanov's blunders using the hashtag #хорхе (a satirical Macedonian transliteration of the Spanish version of the name Gjorje - Jorje), reaching large audiences both in and outside the country.
Among other mistakes in the interview, Ivanov claimed that former French President Jacques Chirac had served as president of the US:
When Jacques Chirac was President of America, he took the position after being mayor of Paris, and because of that experience he coped with the immigrants issue.
Macedonian news portal A1on.mk published an excerpt of the televised interview that includes this claim:
"I was even in Kazakhstan and opened an embassy there.
And to show you how big Kazakhstan is – just imagine how big Europe and all European countries are.
That is how large the surface of Kazakhstan is.”
The president is known for refusing to take part in a public debate since starting his campaign, aside from a few interviews on state-supported media.

Image author anonymous - widely distributed on social networks.
At the start of the presidential campaign, one of the country's national television stations, Telma, claimed that it faced unequal access to information and unfair competition in the media market and blamed this on the government.
Telma stated that it had invited Ivanov to participate in a live televised interview, but that he had declined their invitation.
Telma responded on their prime time news programme, saying that "Ignorance is the method of the insecure":
The man who wants to be the president of all citizens, and that means to us too, decided to play by the rules from the centre and ignore us, without saying whether he will accept our invitation or not!
Ivanov's rejection of Telma's invitation to participate in an interview provoked a discussion among many Macedonian users on Twitter.
Twitter user @parg0, a social media activist from the capital Skopje, said:
#Хорхе beginning to decline invitations.
There's going to be an empty chair in the studio I see. http://t.co/AIzDm1P4ub Or they'd have either way.
After this tweet, other users reported that Ivanov had rejected or ignored invitations for interviews or debates from other independent media outlets.
The web portal Libertas noted that several hours after the beginning of the online discussion about Ivanov's clumsy television appearance, several videos containing content from the interview in question were removed from YouTube .
After the removal of some of the videos, some Twitter users compared Ivanov with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyib Erdoğan, who has also faced criticism for blocking social media sites in late March 2014
I saw yesterday that the video where Ivanov said Chirac was president of the US was removed.
Don’t forget, #Хорхе’s heart is with Erdoğan.
It remains unclear why the videos are no longer available.
Some social media users have suggested that YouTube could have taken them down following user complaints, that the original posters of the videos have now removed them themselves, or that they had been forced to remove them under pressure from the authorities.
Ethiopians marked April Fools’ Day on Twitter with a steady stream of fake news headlines that imitated the "lies" of state-owned Ethiopian Television (ETv), the only national TV station in the African country.
Using the hashtag #ETvDay, netizens accused ETv of "telling lies 365 days".
It all started with the image below:
ETv made it to the UN international days list. #ETvDay in #EtvStyle.
Customizing: April Fools’ is for foreigners. “Ours” is ETv.
Soli joked about the next general election in 2015:
The coming 2015 national election is fair, free and democratic. #ETVday. #Ethiopia — Soli ሶሊ (@Soli_GM) April 1, 2014 The disputed 2005 Ethiopian election ended in street protests, with 193 people killed and more that 30,000 people detained by security forces.
In 2010, the election ended in a landslide victory for the incumbent Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, taking 99.6 percent of parliamentary seats.
The opposition rejected the results and international observers said the election fell short of international standards.
Apparently, Ethiopia will meet one of its Millennium Development Goals - a set of development goals agreed upon at the United Nations' Millennium Summit in 2000 - in record time:
Sources revealed that Ethiopia will provide a supply of clean water before the Millennium Development Goals deadline
Gulelle sub-city residents who couldn't get drinking water for the past 20 days said they were not affected because they had been given training on how to live without water.

A South Korean ferry heading to a resort island sank on April 16, 2014 with hundreds of passengers, including 325 high school students, on board.
It has been two days since the accident and 28 people are confirmed dead as of April 18 and 268 people are still missing.
Their chances of survival are very slim.
Three images below have been shared publicly by the South Korean Coast Guard's Facebook page .
The first photo shows the boat's captain amongst the first group to be rescued.
Image shared publicly by South Korean Coast Guard's Facebook page
Image of Sewol ferry rescue operation, shared by Korean Coast Guard's Facebook Page
Image of Rescue Operation, shared by Korean Coast Guard's Facebook page
South Korean online venues have been inundated with messages of condolences for the victims and their loved ones and intense anger against the captain and crew members who evacuated early , well before most of the passengers.
In particular, the on board announcement which told the passengers to stay still , even after the ferry started tilting, has further fueled the furor.
During the 2003 Daegu Subway fire disaster, a majority of passengers died as the train conductor ran away after plucking away the master key.
I hear the stories that the Sewol ferry’s captain and the conductor evacuated early.
I wish it is false.
If that is true, then they can't be forgiven nor escape punishment.
The captain, after ordering a low-ranking female crew member to announce that the passengers should stay where they are, escaped well before anybody else.
It reminds me of the historical event during the Korean War - when President Rhee Seung-man, after broadcasting that "now it is safe", ran away after cutting the Han River bridge.
It's been over 60 years, but the history stays the same.
Authorities still can't confirm what caused the incident, and various speculations have sprung up, including that the ferry could have hit a rock.
Currently, many blame the fact that the ship went through illegal remodeling to host more passengers.
Korean net users discussed the unsolved mysteries.
There are remaining questions: 1) How was the ferry wrecked in an area with no reef and on a clear weather day 2) There is a big dent on the right side of the hull.
3) Announcing "stay put" while the ship started tilting 4) The crew and captain evacuated first 5) The distress call was made at 8:58 by a passenger 6) Local fisherman noticed there is something wrong with Sewol at 7:30.
Many blamed sensational and insensitive media coverage.
If you look at Munhwa newspaper's initial report, you can see how lazy they were in reporting this issue.
MBC talks about money even before the rescue operation has ended.
KBS focuses more on the president's reaction than the survivors and updates on the rescue mission (by blogger with the online handle of "I am Peter")
The rescue mission is under way.
However, the victims' relatives and families have released a statement lashing out that information is still lacking and the scale of the rescue team has been greatly exaggerated.
When we arrived at 5:30 at the Jindo gymnasium emergency center, there was not a single staff member who was responsible for telling people what's going on.
There was not even a control center We visited the accident scene yesterday.
The rescue team was less than 200. There were only two helicopters, two marine boats, two coast guard boats, six special forces boats.
And eight civil rescue team members have carried out the rescue mission.
However, the Disaster Headquarters have lied to us that they have dispatched 555 rescue team members, 121 helicopters and 169 boats.
**Further update is to come about the disaster.
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wanted Boeing to take responsibility for the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airline flight MH370.
He wrote in his blog:
Boeing built this aircraft.
Boeing must explain how all these means of tracking the plane can be disabled, can fail.
Either Boeing technology is poor or it is not fail-safe.
I would not like to fly in Boeing aircraft unless Boeing can explain how all its system can fail or be disabled.
Boeing must accept responsibility for building an aircraft that can disappear in mid-air so completely.
Win Tin, legendary Burmese journalist and activist, died last April 21.
Photo from @hrw (Human Rights WatchVeteran Burmese journalist and pro-democracy activist U Win Tin died of renal failure on April 21, 2014 at the age of 85.
Before the rise of the military junta in the 1960s, Win Tin was editor of Myanmar’s most popular newspaper.
In 1988, he helped form the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and supported the candidacy of Aung San Suu Kyi.
He was accused of being a communist and got arrested in 1989.
After three years, his prison term was extended after he was charged with sedition.
In 1996, he was convicted again to another seven years in jail after he sent an 83-page report to the United Nations about the poor prison conditions in Myanmar.
He was finally released in 2008 after being incarcerated for 19 years.
But despite regaining his freedom, he continued to wear a blue prison shirt in solidarity with other political prisoners.
He remained a loyal and good friend of Aung San Suu Kyi although he was critical of some of her political decisions including the participation of the NLD in the elections.
Win Tin was Myanmar’s longest-held political prisoner.
Unlike Aung San Suu Kyi who was placed under house arrest, Win Tin was detained in a cell designed for military dogs.
Zin Linn, a former political prisoner, described Win Tin’s prison cell:
They put him alone in his cell.
The cell was 8.5 x 11.5 feet.
There was only a bamboo mat on the concrete floor.
Sleeping, eating, walking and cleaning the bowels were done in the very same place.
He could not see the sun, the moon or the stars.
He was intentionally barred from breathing fresh air, tasting nourishing food and drinking a drop of fresh water.
The worst thing was to stay lonely in such a cage for years.
He called Win Tin ‘the most valiant journalist in Burma’:
For the junta, U Win Tin is really a rocky mountain.
Although they wish to crush that mountain, they could never do it.
But as tough as was with his oppressors, his tenderness towards his comrades and his people was boundless.
He truly deserves great honor for his sacrifices.
Kyaw Zwa Moe, editor of the Irrawaddy magazine, noted how Win Tin never compromised with the ruling junta despite his failing health:
But for any oppressive government, Win Tin was a great enemy.
Due to his political activities, the former regime put him in jail for nearly two decades, tortured him, withheld medical treatment and confiscated his home.
When they eventually released him in 2008, they demanded that he remain on parole.
Still, despite their pressure, he never backed down from his principles.
Ye Htut, deputy minister of information, released a statement in behalf of the government:
We have different political views than Win Tin, but we all take our hats off to him for his commitment to his beliefs and for his sacrifices.
Though we don’t agree with him, we take seriously his good intentions to make the country developed, democratic and prosperous in the ways he believed.
We believe U Win Tin’s death is a great loss—not only the loss of an open voice of criticism in Burmese politics, but also Burmese media has lost a journalist of experience and wisdom.
Mya Aye, member of the 88 Generation Students Group, recognized Win Tin as a humble and selfless leader:
We must be proud of him and think of him as a role-model politician …He didn’t want to bother anyone.
He even had a wish for an immediate funeral.
He was a selfless man.
He didn’t want any property for himself, he only served the country.
He deserved to see that which he sacrificed for.
Aung Zaw described Win Tin as a guiding light of the democracy movement:
Win Tin was a keen, unrelenting government critic to the very end, intent on taking down all the obstacles on Burma’s long road to democracy.
Without his guiding light, it’s hard to imagine how the democracy movement will treat the many challenges ahead during this unpredictable democratic transition, where there are still many wolves in sheep’s clothing.
For me, the film tells a story of a strong and independent mind – a man who dared to say “no”, when all others said “yes”.
A man who liked to be alone sometimes, but also appreciated the company of the many friends he made during his life.
From time to time, he was a little bit obstinate and rebellious, but it’s this kind of person that makes it all more interesting, I think.
I will miss my uncle from Burma, because I would have liked to show him that many journalists and filmmakers will continue to work for better journalism in his country.
He would have liked that.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of the Human Rights Watch, paid tribute to Win Tin:
U Win Tin was the exemplar of dignified courage and principle against decades of brutal military rule.
U Win Tin inspired an entire generation of activists who have taken up his call and struggle to make Burma a rights-respecting democracy.
The U.S. Campaign for Burma also honored Win Tin:
As the movement to establish a free Burma continues, let us pay homage to a man who dedicated his life to the cause.
U Win Tin was a journalist, a prisoner, a leader, and an icon.
Though he is no longer with us, we hope to help create the type of country U Win Tin sought: one represented by the people, all people, unbound by authoritarian control.
The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) Secretary-General Debbie Stothard recalled how Win Tin never backed down in criticizing the ‘flawed reform process’ undertaken by the current civilian government:
When many were applauding the recent progress in Burma, we needed Win Tin to remind us of the sober reality of the country’s flawed reform process.
He will be greatly missed but never forgotten.
A small leopard cat.
Photo is taken by the Wildlife First Aid Station and reprinted by leopardcatgo.
Leopard cat is listed as a vulnerable species in Taiwan.
Since the big cats live in the forests and jungles in both plains and in hilly areas and their home range is very broad, their habitats in Taiwan are easily disturbed by new construction projects.
The Taiwanese environmental evaluation committee had temporally rejected the request from the Miaoli Government to develop an alternative road in Miaoli across the habitat of leopard cats on April 16 2014 after a round of protests and petition.
However, this development project was not dropped, and more development projects in this area are coming up.
A facebook page was set up so people who want to protect the leopard cats in Taiwan can be well informed and mobilized.
Typhoon Haiyan caused a ship to ran aground in Leyte, destroying houses in a crowded coastal village.
Photo by Alessandro Pavone/ Save the ChildrenAlso see Haiyan Devastates the Philippines, our special coverage page.
Six months ago, thousands died in Eastern Visayas in the Philippines after it was hit by super typhoon Haiyan (local name: Yolanda).
Today, thousands continue to suffer due to the lack of a comprehensive government master plan to rehabilitate the devastated region.
After learning about this report, Senator Chiz Escudero berated local officials for failing to understand the gravity of the situation:
This is very sad.
Six months after Yolanda, more than a year after the previous disasters we don't even know what exactly the affected communities need?
It is not about what we can give or what we will to give.
This lackadaisical attitude is prolonging the anguish of victims.
It is bordering on criminal already.
Exacerbating the problem is the lack of coordination among government agencies:
Haiyan caused a storm surge last November which destroyed thousands of villages.
More than 16 million people were affected by the disaster.
Several organizations have observed that the typhoon victims are slowly recovering but many problems persist.
The Red Cross lamented that basic services have not been restored in some areas:
Affected communities have shown remarkable strength and many are on the road to recovery.
However, high levels of pre-existing poverty are holding people back and in some areas basic services have not been re-established.
Only half of health clinics in the typhoon-damaged provinces have resumed operations which undermined the health of mothers and newborns.
This report from Save the Children:
At a medical center in Eastern Visayas, several babies died from conditions that are normally treatable, such as hypothermia and hypoglycemia, often because nurses were unable to examine newborns properly at night because there was no power for lights.
Four months after the typhoon, only half of affected communities had seen their health centers reopen.
Challenges in delivering critical childbirth and newborn care services were specially great in Tacloban and Leyte.
Meanwhile, Oxfam warned that 200,000 survivors in coastal areas are at risk of worsening poverty because the government plans to relocate them to safe settlements without adequate consideration as to how they will later earn a living.
Professor Carl Ramota visited the Palo campus of the country’s premier state university and reported the deplorable conditions in the school:
Six months after typhoon Yolanda decimated its campus in Palo, Leyte, there is still no clear plan for the rehabilitation or relocation of the UP School of Health Sciences.
While nearby structures are already being reconstructed, the Palo campus remains in ruins.
Worse, the asbestos roofing in the old SHS building has not yet been removed, posing a threat to the maternity clinic beside it and other residents.

Youth leader Divs Mosquera also visited Tacloban, the ‘ground zero’ of the disaster, and was moved by the stories of the typhoon survivors.
Months after Yolanda, Leyte is still a tent city.
I've cried buckets since I arrived, hearing the survivors' stories just breaks my heart.
Government statistics placed the number of dead at about 6,300.
But the figures could be higher because dead bodies are still being retrieved in the region.
Al Octaviano, a resident of Leyte province, said that many dead bodies are not being reported to authorities:
I tied them together so they would not be washed away by the sea, but you know when bodies are immersed in sea water, they fall apart.
There are also many bones buried in the mud of the shallows, but people don’t report these anymore.
For its part, the government acknowledged the criticisms of its relief work but warned against politicians who are exploiting the situation to advance their political agenda:
...we are likewise cynical of those whose agenda includes misleading our people to believe that government is not sensitive enough to alleviate the suffering of the survivors.
We detest politicians and political groups who strive to put blinders in exploiting the vulnerability of victims of Yolanda.
Nigerian bloggers have added their voice to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign:
We, the under signed Nigerian bloggers, view with grave concern the continued detention of the innocent school girls who were abducted from Chibok on April 15, 2014.
We are of the strong view that no amount of social grievance either against the government and or the people of Nigeria can justify such an act of violence against school children.
We therefore condemn the abduction in very strong terms.
The also called on their government to expedient action in getting back the abducted high school students from the Boko haram terrorists:
We also call on the government of Nigeria to do everything in its power, even if it includes involving an international security agency, to bring the girls back from the hands of those who currently hold them, and restore a sense of security to the country as soon as possible.
Elections are coming up next year.
Citizens want to be able to feel safe wherever they are.
Democracy thrives best when citizens feel empowered to pursue their daily chores without fear or threat to their lives and property.
If our own children were to go missing we would want the world to come to a standstill and help us find them.
We...ask that...you consider why so often women’s bodies become the battlefields upon which wars are fought.
This is not a problem that involves a small town in Nigeria, this involves all girls everywhere.
Tillah Willah sends a letter to Goodluck Jonathan, asking that he treat "the disappearance of the 234 school girls in Chibok, Borno...with a bit more urgency."
Mikel Agirregabiria gets inspiration from the movie Dead Poets Society to point out the current needs of education:
The 21st century educations demands posing again some issues that were not evident in the past, as where do you want to live or work, with what languages or with what cultures you'l be more comfortable of related, how will you professionally rebuild your working life several times,...

Story from ChinaSMACK.
China has detained prominent rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang on the charge of “causing a disturbance,” what is seen as an attempt to deter activists from marking the upcoming 25th anniversary of the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
According to newspaper South China Morning Post, Pu had been criminally detained by Beijing police after attending a meeting to commemorate the 1989 crackdown on democracy as well as "explore its implications and consequences and call for an investigation into the truth of June 4.’’
At least 15 people – scholars, activists and relatives of the victims killed in the Tiananmen crackdown – attended the gathering at a private home in Beijing on May 3, 2014.
At least five other people taken away for questioning after the meeting.
Photos of Pu in the 1989 Tiananmen protest.
Photo circulated on Twitter.
Pu is a prominent figure in the Weiquan movement, having advocated for writers and journalists in a number of high-profile cases, including artist Ai Weiwei.
He was featured in magazines for leading campaign against labour camps.
Due to his outspoken criticisms of official policies, Pu is monitored by security forces, and has been detained and questioned on several occasions.
Pu was banned from all microblogging platforms in China in 2013 after he used them to publicly criticize retired senior leader of the Communist Party Zhou Yongkang.
Pu also participated in the 1989 pro-democracy movement as a student.
Any information related to the Tiananmen movement is still censored in China.
A search of “Tiananmen” on popular microblogging Sina Weibo reveals a message telling users that results cannot be found according to related laws and regulations.
Many lawyers showed concern for Pu and called for Pu’s release on Weibo.
However, most messages supporting Pu were deleted.
Bejing Lawyer Deng Shulin's message was soon deleted:
Pu Zhiqiang must be released.
Is arresting lawyers the future direction of judicial reform?
Well-known Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi asked her Weibo followers to watch a movie about how lawyers uphold justice:
"The attorney ", a lawyer who pursues democracy, rule of law and justice fights for the truth and deeply inspires.
The movie is based on the true story of former Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun.
No need to repeat here how the film looks, go see it for yourself.
Human Rights Watch’s Maya Wang commented on Twitter:
Detention of Pu and others r the best ads for the 25th anniversary & is attracting exactly the kind of attention the authorities don't want. — Maya Wang 阿莲 (@wang_maya) May 6, 2014
Journalist Sui-Lee Wee quoted an essay by Pu on Twitter:
Gd time to read Pu Zhiqiang's essay on June 4.

Daniel Bustos blogs from Colombia on the economy of the World Cup in Brazil and after touching upon the inevitable issue of corruption, states:
Finally, Brazil will serve as a "guinea pig" for the Latin American countries that someday had dreamt of organizing this great event, it will serve to ask if Brazil will have good returns with all of the inverted infrastructure or if, on the contrary, it was a serious and costly error, if it will make countries like ours reflect on what is being done in the governments in matters of infrastructure, employment, education, and of course, investing in the sport all so that one day a World Cup could be organized.

Global Voices and CONNECTAS , Colombia-based Latin American journalistic organization, have partnered to share content produced by CONNECTAS on multilingual Global Voices network.
CONNECTAS is a "non-profit journalistic initiative with the aim of promoting production, sharing, training and disseminating information related to topics that are fundamental for development in the Americas":
CONNECTAS appears in a moment where many opportunities converge in the region, and a need of information of their reality with a transnational prospect.
In the Americas, in spite of being a region with similar cultural, historic and linguistic features, of having an active civil society and a growing number of intergovernmental businesses and organizations, there is not enough information with a transnational perspective in the region.
Besides journalistic production, CONNECTAS facilitates journalist training in specialized techniques and topics and organizes meetings, forums and talks with opinion leaders and policymakers.
They also promote laws on access to public information in the region and data exchange for investigation, analysis, mapping and visualization.
We believe that the articles and reports produced by CONNECTAS will be a quality complement to our coverage of Latin America.
Read the first article published in English by CONNECTAS on Global Voices, "How Gangs Have Become a Trojan Horse in El Salvador's Security Forces" The second part will be posted shortly.
The Vietnam Human Rights Network released its 2013 report about the 'worsening' human rights situation in Vietnam:
...the human rights situation in Vietnam took a turn for the worse in 2013.
The number of people detained for political views contrary to those of the ruling party increased, unabated police violence was reflected in the still high number of deaths and injuries caused by such violence, and the number of farmers whose land was expropriated without adequate compensation was on the rise.
The report noted that Vietnam's poor record contradicted its commitment to promote human rights after it became a member of the UN Human Rights Council and after it included human rights concepts on its Constitution.
The latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on the health of adolescents worldwide notes that :
The top 3 causes of adolescent deaths globally are road traffic injuries, HIV/AIDS, and suicide.
Worldwide, an estimated 1.3 million adolescents died in 2012.
The report also adds that :
Mortality rate is higher for teenagers between the age of 15 and 19 that those between 10 and 14 years old.
Although some causes of death are common to both sexes, young boys die at higher rate because of violence while giving birth as a teen is the main cause of death for young girls.
Some policies are suggested to better respond to the mental and overall health needs of adolescents.
Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health, WHO states that states that:
The world has not paid enough attention to the health of adolescents.

Another foreign domestic worker abuse case was exposed.
The victim Rowena Uychiat was allegedly forced to work 21 hours a day (6am till 3am) without a day off.
She claimed to have been slapped, kicked, verbally abused and had her hair pulled.
Tom Grundy reported the case in detail.
Active Voice shares an eye-opening collection of tweets that offers different perspectives about #bringbackourgirls.
Gershom Ndhlovu looks at the reasons why ailing African leaders wont step down:
There have been rumours, innuendoes and even insinuations regarding the health, or the lack of it, of Zambia’s President Michael Chilufya Sata, in office since September 2011.
These have been spread by the largely unregulated online media that the Patriotic Front (PF) government is intent on controlling or even shutting down altogether.
The government has not particularly responded to these rumours apart from issuing one-liner statements refuting the stories about the health status of the 76 year-old head of state and veteran politician.
However, when Sata appeared at a May 1 Labour Day parade to receive a traditional salute from workers in the land, the appearance was very brief and only accompanied by a one minute address before getting into his motorcade for a three kilometre drive back to the presidential palace, a lot of people were convinced the President was not well.
Angie Ramos guest blogs at Tintero Político about the crisis in Ukraine and after analyzing different key factors involved concludes with the reaction of the internacional community:
The thing is, the international community, facing cases like this one, acts subjectively as it depends on the magnitude of the interests involved to support or express rejection to some interventionism in various countries.
Is it that some countries have privileges for the international community?
For instance, in the case of the conflict between Great Britain and Argentina regarding Falkland Islands, a referendum carried out on the population, where 98% of the population voted for staying under Great Britain's administration, received support, while in Crimea, there is no will for acknowleding the legality of the process.
Omg Ghana reports about Joshua Beckford's outstanding academic achievement:
At age 8, you were probably practicing a sport or was preparing for the third grade.
Well, meet an 8 year old with a twist, Joshua Beckford.
This particular young boy is by far not your average 8 year old.
He studied at Oxford University at the age of 6, and he is the face of the National Autistic Society’s Black and Minority (BME) campaign.
It’s put in to place to highlight the obstacles that people with black minority background often encounter when trying to obtain the access to support and services they need.
Beckford is one of a kind, he is too advanced for his required school grade so that lead him into being homeschooled.
He excels in Math, Foreign Languages, History, Philosophy, IT and Science.
Beza Tesfaye explains why blogging is a threat to the Ethiopian government following the arrests of nine Ethiopian bloggers:
As I write this, I am eerily reminded that in Ethiopia, expressing your views can get you a first class ticket to prison.
From April 25 to 26, 2014, nine Ethiopian bloggers and journalists were arrested.
As we celebrated World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, they were being detained in Addis Ababa’s notorious central investigation office.
Though charges have not officially been filed, the group is accused of “working with foreign human rights activists” and “using social media to destabilize the country”.
If prosecuted under Ethiopia’s controversial Anti-Terrorism Law, they could face the death penalty.
The arrests are part of a disturbing trend in Ethiopia, which has frequently ranked as one of the most repressive places for press freedom in recent years.
More and more people are demanding transparency from their governments and leaderships.
By demanding transparency, what people want is to confirm the presence of ethics in government acts.
But, what about private companies?
Ingrid Kost thinks ethics is indipensable if we want corporate sustainability:
The demand for more transparency and accountability increases the companies responsibility for improving the dissemination of information regarding their activities.
Sustainability reports appear as a tool that favors the convergence of the company with a society that increasingly supports its environment ethic behavior.

The blog from Parque Biblioteca Tomás Carrasquilla - La Quintana, in Medellin, Colombia, expresses its support for free culture.
After explaining the liberties free culture brings, the blog describes how can this fit together with a librarian's work:
Public libraries can learn from these liberties to share the creative processes carried out within the communities they serve, and this can empower local information service, co-created, shared, noticed and available to everybody so other libraries, organizations, study groups and individuals may be able to replicate them, improve them and adapt them to their own needs and necessities, so in tiime they can give back those experiences to the original node and diversify what they have learned.

The homes of tens of thousands of people are under water after massive flooding in Serbia.
Government ineptitude has left people to fend for themselves in many cases, but luckily citizen initiatives to deliver aid and help inform the public are multiplying.
Meanwhile, social networks, the media, and even public personas find themselves threatened by authorities for "inciting panic" at a time when access to more quality information is sorely needed.
What's going on?
On GV Face this week, we talk to friends in Serbia, including our Central and Eastern Europe Editor Danica Radisic to get a local perspective on the news.

Popular Tibetan singer Gepe was arrested after singing in a music concert.
Screen capture from YouTube.
Tibetan singer Gepe was arrested on 24 May 2014 in Sichuan province after his performance in a concert attended by thousands.
The concert, organized by a group of Tibetan youth, had received permission from local authorities, and according to a report from Voice of America, the concert was to address the importance of Tibetan language and culture.
Gepe is a popular singer from Ngaba in Amdo.
Back in 2012, after he released an album that expresses the pain of separation from his spiritual leader and a strong desire for Tibetan unity, he disappeared for quite a lengthy period of time.
Below is one of his songs, "I am coming" with English subtitles translated by Grey Buffalo:
Gepe is not the first Tibetan singer to be prosecuted in China.
Since the unrest of March 2008 in Lhasa, Tibetan artists have been one of the targets of political suppression.
Tibetan author and poet Tsering Woeser described the series of crackdowns as "the same policies of the Cultural Revolution but of a different name".
Last December, Thinley Tsekar and Gonpo Tenzin were arrested in Diru County.
Both sing about Tibetan identity, culture and language.
Thinley was sentenced to nine years imprisonment for "mobilizing anti-government sentiments among Tibetan listeners of his music".
Here is one of his songs available on YouTube:
In April 2012, popular Tibetan singer Lo Lo was arrested after he released an album titled "Raise the flag of Tibet, sons of snow".
The singer was eventually sentenced to six years imprisonment in August 2013.
Below is one of his songs via YouTube:
To promote loyalty to the Land of Snows
For the complete independence of Tibet
With a realised understanding of our objectives
Raise the flag of Tibet- sons of the snow
In March 2012, popular singer Ugyen Tenzin was detained after the release of his album titled "An Unending Flow of My Heart's Blood".
Some of his songs are dedicated to spiritual leaders including the Dalai Lama and Karmapa.
Below is his album's theme song, "The Heart's Blood Flows", with English subtitles translated by "High peaks pure earth":
In 2011, well-known female singer Hortsang Lhalung Tso was detained before attending a Tibetan culture show in Sangchu county with other popular Tibetan singers and musicians.
Here is one of her songs on YouTube:
A Macedonian blogger and activist has brought attention to the plight of Mr. Dushko Brankovikj .
Brankovikj has had his property nationalized twice by the state over the last 65 years, and although he won all the court cases regarding this matter to date, Macedonian state institutions have failed to implement the verdicts and return his property.
The elderly man is still protesting in front of a primary court in Skopje and plans to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Macedonian activist Nikola Pisarev posted a photo of a man holding handwritten signs reading, "How can municipal decision be stronger than the Supreme Court decision?
It can with this Supreme Court.
With such judgments we'll end up on Mars instead of in the EU!
The Supreme Court should be a Corrector, not a Caricature":
the elderly Brankovikj protesting in front of Supreme Court in Skopje, Macedonia.
Photo by Aleksandar Pisarev, published with permission.
Pisarev also included further explanation of the image on his blog:
Individual activism often starts with a goal of solving personal problems, which is legitimate, as many others might be concerned by the same issue (in this case the non-functioning of the Macedonian judiciary resulting in "unjust" justice).
Therefore, this man deserves respect and support by all of us who believe in the power of civic action.
In the absence of media and absence of institutional justice, the only thing one can do is protest!
I do not know this man from before.
I met him few days ago, he is holding individual protests before the court almost every day, seeking justice since 1973.
According to his explanation and the materials he showed me, he is right.
Sadly, the non-functional local government makes his life bitter and brutally infringes on his right to private property.
Respect for your act, Uncle.
The most recent US State Department Human Rights Report on Macedonia, published on Feb. 28, 2014, notes the following among the key issues plaguing the country:
"Political interference, inefficiency, favoritism toward well placed persons, prolonged judicial processes, and corruption characterized the judicial system."
As a result of Pisarev's profile on his blog and social media, several independent media outlets have published stories about Brankovikj's case and people have now taken up commenting not only this particular matter but about Macedonian courts and government systems in general on social media and elsewhere.
City Press reports the suicide of Godfrey Kamanya, a Malawian deputy minister, apparently after losing his parliamentary seat during the general elections held on 20 May 2014 :
The official results of Tuesday’s election are still to be announced.
But preliminary election results aired on radio stations indicated that Kamanya was faring badly in the poll and was likely to lose his parliamentary seat.
In a suicide note now held by police, Kamanya reportedly said he took his life because of misunderstandings related to politics.
He also outlined how his wealth would be distributed and asked incumbent President Joyce Banda, under whom he served, to help pay the school fees for his child.
Gershom Ndhlovu explains why it is a tough job being an opposition leader in Zambia:
It is really a tough job to be an opposition leader in Zambia.
You have to daily face the police, risk being teargased or even locked for doing the job that you must do — meeting potential voters even when elections are five years away or performing the most important function, that of providing checks and balances.
Opposition Members of Parliament are equally poached at will by the head of state.
If there is a cliché that applies in this situation is that of “history repeats itself.”
The process of harassment, for that is what it is, tends to bake the leaders for when they take over government and apply the same methods to those who fall in the unfortunate role of being opposition leaders especially if they are popular.

234 girls between the ages of 16-18 yrs were abducted almost 2 weeks ago in Nigeria: #bringourgirlsback.
Source: The Facebook page #‎bringourgirlsback‬ - Public Domain
In mid-april, over 200 school girls were abducted from a secondary school, in Chibok, Nigeria by Boko Haram, a terrorist group based in the northern region.
Although some 57 of the girls have managed to escape, there are still many others at the hands of the kidnappers.
On April 30, Nigerian women have organized demonstrations in cities across the country to demand that the government intensifies its efforts to rescue the girls.
The Sahara Reporters news site published a photo coverage from Kaduna, Nigeria.
Nigerian bloggers have also created a Facebook page with the hashtag #bringourgirlsback, asking to spread the outrage on Internet against this criminal action by extremist rebels.

Senegalese sculptor Ousmane Sow was admitted on December 11 into L'Académie des Beaux-Arts de Paris .
Africa-top-talents.com reports:
This is a wonderful consecration for the Senegalese sculptor known for his series of monumental sculptures devoted to African tribes (Nuba, Fulani, Masai, Zulu).
He states: "My election feels even greater to me because you had the wisdom to never introduce a racial, ethnic or religious quota for admission (...)
As my colleague and fellow Senegalese Leopold Sédar Senghor, elected to the French Academy thirty years ago, I am Africanist.
In this spirit, I dedicate this ceremony to Africa as a whole, to its diaspora and to the great man who has just left us, Nelson Mandela."
L'Express Mada reports that the entire village of Andranondambo in the South of Madagascar was destroyed during an inter-village conflict that stems from a dispute over land rights.
The civilian conflict, which lasted from May 20 to 22, left no residents of the village alive.
One of the military police officers recalls :
When we arrived, a dog was eating what was left of a corpse.
In a nearby home destroyed by fire, we found more corpses. The stink was unbearable.
Even the public school and the church were ravaged.
All the materials from houses were taken apart.
The land dispute started in 1991 when an important source of sapphire and mica was discovered in the Andranondambo.
The rush of land miners pushed local villagers away to another village Ambato­tsivala.
Since then, the two villages have been at odds over land rights but the conflict has never reached such a harrowing level of violence until recently.
Not long after protesters took over Taiwan's legislature over a controversial trade deal with China, the island's capital city Taipei was rocked by more protesters from April 26 to April 30, this time against a fourth nuclear power plant currently under security check that they fear is a danger.
Police forced the protesters from their gathering spots and set up barbed-wire fences and barricades to prevent them from coming back.
Numerous chevaux de frise were placed around the presidential office, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan and other important government buildings.
In response, protesters got creative.
They decorated the fences with anti-nuclear ribbons, political banners, flowers and other items, turning the barricades into what some have dubbed a contemporary street art exhibition.
Many Taiwanese netizens have shared photos of the art, and below is a selection.
A warning sign hung beside the fence reads, "Danger, don't come near."
The photo was taken by Facebook user Chuan Hsiang Chang, who called the fence "the silent spiral."

Macau, a special administrative region of China, has a population of about 500,000.
Protesters constituted 4 percent of the total population, the largest demonstrations since the former Portuguese colony was handed over to China's control in 1999.
The public outrage has surprised many, given opposition parties are rather weak in the casino city and major mainstream media outlets are pro-government mouthpieces and sponsored by the government.
The bill, which is expected to be passed on Tuesday, 27 May, 2014, was drafted by the Macau Secretary for Administration and Justice a month ago and was proposed without public consultation.
It will grant the chief executive, as the head of government is called, immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.
It also ensures that the outgoing chief executive, as well as his principal officials-designate, will continue receiving a monthly payment equivalent to 70 percent of his or her monthly salary.
The secretary claimed that the bill is to attract business elites to join the government.
The selection of new chief executive will happen at the end of 2014, and after that major officials will also leave their positions.
Many believe that the bill is tailor-made for outgoing Chief Executive Fernando Chui Sai-on and top officials because they will be the ones to immediately enjoy the new privileges.
Even though the bill is highly controversial, the administration has been pushing the legislative council to pass it.
The majority of lawmakers are either elected indirectly through functional groups or appointed by the chief executive.
To press the government to withdraw the bill, a group of concerned citizens called "Macau Conscience" organized the march against "the Bill of Greed and Privilege."
Independent media outlet All About Macau asked one of the protesters on their Facebook group why she joined the rally:
Ms. Lam believes that the chief executive who will enjoy the outgoing compensation is "robbing Macau citizens" and making himself an enemy of the people.
Many expressed their anger through banners and placards while at the protest.
A protester holds a placard showing the Macau chief executive's face on a fake bank note.
The slogan on the placard reads: "A monthly salary more than 200,000 pataca wanted as outgoing compensation?
Impotent officials are out of their mind!"

Soon after the rally, a number of pro-government lawmakers and executive councilors told the press that their would propose to the chair of the Legislative Council to form a committee to further review the bill.
At the same time, organizer of the rally "Macau Conscience" said they would take further action if the legislature passes the bill on Tuesday.
Macedonian journalists were aggressively forced by police to delete their photos and video of arrests during ethnically charged protests that left trash containers burned and public facilities damaged in the Gorce Petrov suburb of Skopje.
As officers began detaining a total of 27 protesters, reporters from Radio Free Europe, NovaTV, and Focus say they also became a target of police for documenting the action.
Police pushed and shoved journalists, with one officer even confiscating a camera to scrub the footage himself.
The riots during the evenings of 19 and 20 May, 2014 were a reaction to the killing of a 19-year-old recent high school graduate after he and his father chased a thief who had stolen a bicycle.
The suspect currently in custody for the murder is of Albanian ethnicity, and while riots created tension between ethnic Albanian and Macedonian populations of Skopje, Macedonian citizens of all ethnicities appealed through social networks to their fellow countrymen to keep calm and deescalate this situation.
Macedonian activist Biljana Ginova wrote on Facebook that all the people in the country should be sickened by the hatred.
Her Facebook status was widely circulated on social networks and later spread to mainstream media sites.
We should be revolted that we pay the police to not protect us, they are not on our side and it is used only as weapon by the same people who are watching us die from their armchairs.
Macedonia is home to 2.1 million people, of which 63 percent are ethnic Macedonian and 25 percent are ethnic Albanian.
The country has a history of ethnic tension and intolerance, the most recent being the armed conflict of 2001 between Macedonian national security forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents.
That ended with the Ohrid Framework Agreement that granted greater minority rights for Albanians in the country.

A journalist from the web portal NovaTV, Sashka Cvetkovska, told Radio Free Europe that they had initially been granted a permit by police authorities to take photos and videos of the riots, but things seemed to change when the police started arresting the protesters:
The started pursuing us and almost violently required us to delete the recordings ourselves.
One of my colleagues was pushed, I was dragged by my hand and we were insulted.
I refused to delete the footage and didn't turn over my camera, and after that one of the police officers violently took it and started deleting it by himself.
Journalist Meri Jordanovska for web portal Plusinfo said they witnessed police acting violently while taking a young man into custody:
They grabbed him by the hands, dragged him on the ground and started kicking him.
We photographed and filmed all of that.
The reporters filed a petition with the Ministry of Internal Affairs over the the police aggression, but it was rejected.
A ministry press release stated:
After speaking with all 34 officers who participated in the police activity, we can’t determinate that anyone was involved in the event as it is specified in the petition, or confiscated and deleted recorded photo and video material.
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe representative Dunja Mijatovic expressed deep concern over the behavior of police with the journalists covering the demonstrations in Skopje:
The journalists must be able to cover demonstrations freely and without any fear of harassment.
Any violation of the rights of journalists is a clear violation of the right to freedom of the media and can not be tolerated.
The Association of Journalists of Macedonia also contemned the aggression:
Making a pressure to delete and deleting photo and video materials by the police represents is direct violation of the Article 16 of the Constitution which prohibits censorship and guarantees free access to information and the freedom to receive and to transfer information .
With this behavior the police prevented the journalists from reporting the event and put itself in the role of a censor who decides what should and what shouldn’t be seen by the Macedonian public.
Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, at the World Economic Forum on Africa 2009 in Cape Town, South Africa- via wikipedia cc-license-2.0
Rwanda remains deeply scarred by the 1994 genocide of 800,000 to 1 million people, including 80 percent of the Tutsi population as well as many Hutus.
Around one-sixth of the country's total population was killed in a matter of weeks.
Twenty years later the process of reconciliation still has a long way to go.
President Paul Kagame is accused of suppressing his opponents, among other serious human rights violations.
But efforts to rebuild are beginning to yield results.
The Good News
One of Rwanda's most remarkable achievements is the progress of gender equality in numerous areas.
The percentage of women in the Rwandan parliament, at almost 64 percent, is the highest in the world, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union's 2014 ranking of 189 countries.
Louis Michel, a former minister in Belgium and European commissioner, noted on his personal blog :
These results are spectacular: In less than ten years, more than one million people have been lifted from extreme poverty and the country has seen a stable economic growth rate of 8 percent per year.
Today more than 95 percent of children have access to a complete primary school education, infant mortality has been reduced by 61 percent, and three-quarters of the population have access to potable water.
Finally, almost 50 percent of women have access to some means of contraception .... This makes Rwanda one of the very few African countries that will have almost entirely achieved its Millennium Development Goals in 2015.
The country's first five-year plan for the development of new technologies , created in 2001, showed significant progress.
During the plan's second phase, which ended in 2010, Rwanda saw a 8,900 percent increase in users, compared with 2,450 percent for the rest of the continent and a world average of 44 percent.
The magazine African Renewal, hosted by the U.N., reports that four divisions of the public sector (ministers, agencies, provinces, and districts) and almost a third of the private sector have an online presence.
Rwanda's capital Kigali plays a primary role in the development of the surveillance system of navigation and aerial communications throughout the region.
President Kagame maintains that “the Internet is a needed public utility as much as water and electricity."
In collaboration with the Rwandan Telecentre Network (RTN), the government has implemented a plan for the development of Internet access in rural zones.
A report published on balancingact-africa.com states:
Rwandan Telecentre Network (RTN) is rallying with the government's efforts, pledging to create a national network of 1,000 ITC centers by the end of 2015 and to train local personnel.
A further sign of advancing access to new technologies is that Rwanda is the highest achiever among the African countries participating in the program One Laptop Per Child.
According to the OLPC wiki page :
By the end of 2012, 210,000 laptops have been deployed to more than 217 schools across the country.
In 2013: 210k = 110K (before 2012) +100k (2012) laptops in country
The Hopeful News
After the genocide, the country took legal action, creating a National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC).
The NURC, established in 1999, aims to contribute to good government; promote unity, reconciliation and social cohesion between Rwandans; and form a country where everyone has the same rights.
Susan Thomson, a professor of contemporary African politics at Hampshire College in the U.S., wrote in an article published on academic publication hub Cairn.info:
Under Rwandan Patriotic Front's rule, the post-genocide state has made a large contribution to restoring peace, unity and reconciliation throughout the country.
The Rwandan state structure, solid and centralized, has facilitated a rapid reconstruction.
Unlike most other African states, Rwanda is capable of exercising territorial control with great effectiveness.
The state institutions have been restored.
The Rwanda Peace Academy (RPA) is an example of those advances. Created in 2009 with the financial backing of Japan and the United Nations Development Program, the RPA has a mission is to carry out research and to develop and implement professional training courses and internationally recognized educational programs.
Its goal is to provide the army, police and civil servants with the necessary skills to respond to current challenges and future peace and security issues in Africa.
The Bad News
Unfortunately, this promising work is marred by the grave human rights violations reported by advocacy groups.
Violations have been occurring for years.
In 2012, after having sent several missions to the country, Amnesty International condemned the violations:
Between March 2010 and June 2012, Amnesty International documented 45 cases of unlawful detention and 18 allegations of torture or ill-treatment at Camp Kami, Mukamira military camp, and in safe houses in the capital, Kigali.
The men were detained by J2 for periods ranging from 10 days to nine months without access to lawyers, doctors and family members.
Assassinations of opposition members have also been reported outside the country.
Journalists and former political leaders close to the Rwandan president have been arrested or killed .
The most recent arrests were confirmed at the beginning of April 2014.
Singer and activist Kizito Mihigo - Public Domain
The site arretsurimages.net reported the arrest of famous singer Kizito Mihigo, a genocide survivor, and three other individuals, including a journalist accused of plotting a grenade attack on a building in Kigali.
Kizito Mihigo, however, is known for his activism for peace.
He even founded an NGO for peace education.
His blog reads:
Since 2003, he has been working for forgiveness, reconciliation and unity in the Rwandan diaspora in Europe.
Upon his return to Rwanda in 2010, he founded the KMP Foundation (Kizito Mihigo for Peace), a Rwandan NGO that uses art (music, theater, poetry...) in education focused on peace, reconciliation and non-violence after the genocide.
The singer pleaded guilty, but serious doubts were raised about many aspects of the case.
Furthermore, for the past several years Kigali has had tense diplomatic relations with several other countries.
Once a country favored by the West, Rwanda is now becoming a no-go area and is losing its military and development aid.
Diplomatic relations with South Africa are strained following assassinations of opposition members in that country.
There have already been expulsions of diplomats on both sides.
On EnGenerada they reflect on the construction of gender identities and the myhts usually associated to women and men.
They conclude that, in spite of being relativized in reality, they work as social order.

Egypt has a new president in the third elections it has had in as many years.
General Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi won a landslide victory, topping his only oppopent Hamdeen Sabahi, who came in third place.
After three days of voting, the preliminary results are out.
Sisi is reported to have won 93.3 per cent of the votes, Hamdeen took 3pc and 3.7pc of the votes were declared void.
On Twitter, netizens met the news with sarcasm and snark.
Egyptian Aida Elkashef says :
What makes you laugh and cry at the same time is that in elections, with only two candidates, Hamdeen is in third place after the votes that have been declared void
Sherief Gaber asks:
And Egyptian Hosam El Sokkari notes :
The human being is a voting animal (other than this he has no value)
Meanwhile, Nabeel wonders why people are upset Sabahi was not up to the competition.
He asks:
Why are we laying the blame on Hamdeen?
Because he got few votes?
Who suggested for a moment that he could ever win?
Despite Sisi's landslide win, Amro Ali sets a challenge:
Lebanese satirist Karl Sharro adds:
From Bahrain, Abo Omar Al Shafee draws parallels to Bahrain.
He tweets:
Just like the presidential elections were a success in Egypt, the parliamentary elections will definitely be a success in Bahrain.
There is no consolation for those who boycott
And, in conclusion, Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah tweets:
You have turned out to be such an idiot Sisi
Our country cannot continue exporting our jobs, capital and skilled people in favour of unexamined and undisclosed foreign policies.

...despite the ostensible changes in the way the government treats the media, the underlying mindset is much the same as in the past: Journalists have been given greater “space” within which to work, but the limits of that space are still decided by the state.
Join Nigerian bloggers Blossom Nnodim (@blcompere) and Nwachukwu Egbunike (@feathersproject), along with Global Voices editor Ndesanjo Macha (@ndesanjo) from Tanzania for an Africa-wide tweetathon in support of the nine bloggers and journalists arrested in late April and currently being detained in Ethiopia.
The Global Voices community and our network of friends and allies are demanding the release of these nine men and women, all of whom have worked hard to expand spaces for social and political commentary in Ethiopia through blogging and traditional journalism.
We believe their arrest is a violation of their universal right to free expression, as well as their right not to be arbitrarily detained.

Using the hashsags #UcabCaracas and #SOSColectivosDelTerrorAtacanUCAB , comments and images of assaults on students on protests that apparently happened at Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas have been widely shared.
Among those tweeting inside the university campus, that has suspended it academic activities, we find the group UCAB student movement sharing information and posting images of injured students .
5:24PM Tense situation goes on in UCAB CARACAS.
Patrols keep coming and going to the university main entrance.
With the same hashtags, a series of tweets by supportes of chavismo try to deny the information, or criticize students protests.
Also, with #SocialismoProductivo this group aims to highlight what they consider unjustified protests and condemn violent acts.
These are gullible kids who beleive that the point is encouraging violence withour being aware of the consequences of their acts.
There are reports of protests in other universities in provinces and those that have decided not to join the protests are harshly criticized.
All this reflects the informative confusion and the different visions, the main topics of the conflict in Venezuela.

In relation to the new Cosmos series, Víctor R. Ruíz reflects on how the search for scientific knowledge is becoming a question of social responsibility, and the role of scientists in the public sphere:
Both before and then, private companies and governments have agendas that don't always coincide with general interest.
Oil companies continue having scientists on their payroll who are willing to sow doubts.
Countries continue financing the development of high-tech arms.
And sometimes, the boundaries between private and public interests are not even clear.
As explained in my Naukas Bilbao talk last year, the National Security Agency (NSA) hires a third of all mathematicians in the world.
The documents revealed by Edward Snowden indicate that they have implemented and even subverted Internet technologies for spying on a global scale, not so much for the anti-terrorism fight as for commercial espionage.
Víctor concludes from his scientific writer point of view:
The mad scientist cliche may seem like a myth, but the bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not created by evil militaries.
We cannot turn the other cheek pretending that it is not scientists and engineers who develop technologies that are later used to spy on billions of citizens or kill civilians by remote control.
Today, like yesterday, it's our duty to both speak about the passion for knowledge and to criticize the collaboration of scientists on projects that threaten our society.

Anti-government protesters gather at a rally showing their loyalty to King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Protesters are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.
Photo by Sanji Dee, Copyright @Demotix (5/5/2014)Not long after the anti-election protest movement, led by the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), heralded their victory over the annulment of the February election in Thailand, a new date has been set for a second voting day this year on July 20.
The beleaguered Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra seemed elated that she could perhaps hang on to power for a little longer, despite facing two serious corruption charges.
The court will decide on these charges tomorrow, May 7, 2014, and Yingluck could be removed from power if found guilty.
Are Thais excited to be going to the polls for the second time within the span of less than six months?
Polls after polls have shown Thai voters to be "worried" and "wary" about the upcoming new election.
Most believe that the election would unlikely solve the near decade-long political conflict that has dragged Thailand through 6 prime ministers, 5 governments, 3 elections and 1 coup d'etat.
Further, a new election could cost 3.8 billion baht ($127 million) which would be another burden for taxpayers - some of whom are supporters of the PDRC and are likely to boycott the election altogether.
This would be a waste of money, time, resources and headache for everyone if another annulment is to occur.
The opposition boycotted the February polls claiming that the electoral process would not be fair and clean as long as the Prime Minister's family is allowed to participate in it.
The election was held in response to the massive street protests organized by the opposition for more than three months.
Conversations in the Thai cyberspace seems to suggest a rather gloomy sentiment among its voters:
Chaichol MCFC wrote on Pantip web board:
I don't think there will be an election.
Not because of the government, but because of Taug and his associates.
He said he would reform the country for the past 6 months, yet he did nothing but begging on the streets and wreaking havoc.
Comment 1204962 thinks that perhaps another coup is needed:
We already had a house dissolution and the power had been returned to the people.
What else could we have done .
Just have another military coup, please.
Supporters of the PDRC event went further by asking the people to sabotage the election.
On Suthep's - leader of the PDRC - Facebook page, thousands of comments poured in (mostly) to support no "Reform before Election" campaign.
Max Chakrit wrote:
Majority rule doesn't work in Thailand because the voices of the majority come from those with little education (but in other countries, majority rule is fine).
This is why Thai people are easily manipulated....
Porn Pramualsap also commented:
Whoever runs the country, it doesn't matter, as long as they don't cheat on the farmers.
The next few weeks are crucial whether the election would go ahead as planned.
Two major stumbling blocks include whether Yingluck would survive the two charges laid on her; and the other would be whether the candidate registration day, set for May 25, would be carried out smoothly.
The extent to which the registration would be held successfully should be indicative of the likelihood of the election taking place.
Demonstrations in Santiago de Chile.

The first march for education during the current government of President Michelle Bachelet took place on May 8, 2014, with due prior authorization.
The demonstration counted on the participation of several groups.
Among them were Student Confederation of Chile (Confech), National High School Students Assembly (ACES), National High School Students Coordinator (Cones), Movement of Higher Education Students (Mesup), Organization of Private Higher Education Federations (Ofesup) and Association of Ministry of Education Officers (Andime).
The march demanded a free quality education as well as active participation in the reform, which is currently being studied.
The newspaper La Tercera reported:
Student march, what is at stake here?
President of Feuc says students want "participation in the reform".
The march was simultaneously carried out in the capital city Santiago and several other locations in the country.
Participation and presence of an important number of students was noticed:
It's good to see that the student march was massive in Santiago and other regions.
United for a new education that builds a better Chile.
Thousands of young people participate in the first student march of the year in Concepción.
There were marches in several cities in the countryside too, as in Iquique, Valparaíso, the city that is the seat of the National Congress, and Valdivia.
Unfortunately, in some places the marches were overshadowed by disturbances, mostly caused by people other than students and who had nothing to do with their demands.
Naschla Aburman, president of Feuc, labeled these disturbances as "isolated incidents" and stated that there are things that are outside of the responsibility of the organizers.
Twitter users expressed their opinion regarding these facts, spreading images and information about the consequences:
NOW: Governor Orrego says "there haven't been any incidents" during the student march.
However, there were "organized violent people" at the end of it.
Universidad Central reported damages around 20 million pesos after the student march.
General Ricardo Solar reports that the number of people under arrest after the student march is 101.
Romina, I am a student, and I agree with the peaceful march, but these groups are organized
EnGenerada asks its readers if they have what they need to exercise political power.
Every day, we read, hear, and speak the phrase: "Politics is the tool for society's transformation".
As we mature our thinking, we look into some certainties of our context, those pre-concepts that we have incorporated for generations.
At that moment, the possibility of doubt arises and we ask ourselves: Is politics a tool of transformation?
It power necessary to exercise politics?
What is politics ultimately?
Finally, we can also ask ourselves and have the following doubt:Does gender equality exist in politics?
Why?
After stating that it is better to speak of cultural and social construction as opposed to gender identities, they conclude:
Bit by bit, collectively and collaboratively, it is possible to weave a web of possibilities that allows more fair, equal relationships, to put aside pre-conceived ideas like "in politics, they are always the same"; or "power always corrupts" in order to begin thinking that people that exercise political power can change, but that if the mechanics and the ways of exercising political power do not change, it is unlikely that our reality will.
The outlined post participated first in the first #LunesDeBlogsGV on May 5, 2014.
A new political group representing people with disabilities and rare diseases has presented itself to the European elections today May 25.
Besides the large, well-known parties, there are aspiring minority party candidates like the Movimiento Red (Network Movement), Primavera Europea (European Spring), VOX, Podemos (We Can), and Recortes (Cutbacks).
Additionally, this year a new alternative has been launched, called the Association of Voters with Disabilities and Rare Diseases-DER .
Their main objective is not to defend any ideology, but rather improve the quality of life for people living with a disability or rare disease.
Eduard Carreras, head of the DER.
"We are a group of people affected, directly or indirectly, by a disability or rare disease, united by a common goal — improving the lives of those affected," said Eduard Carreras, the group's candidate, a 25-year-old young man from Girona, Spain, suffering from degenerative muscular dystrophy.
The electoral platform centers on issues like employment, since they affirm that young people with disabilities have an unemployment rate that exceeds 60%, thereby preventing their autonomy and independence.
It also focuses on full accessibility in transportation and public spaces, total VAT exemption for services like adapted vehicles or medicine, increasing research on rare diseases, and improving, among other things, health, education, and social inclusion of those affected.
They do not defend nor reject any party or ideology.
Their only purpose is to defend their electoral platform, which according to Carreras, is "the only certain common goal that unites us".
He added: "We are not a party as such.
We do not have an ideology, which is why our path is different from the major parties."
Carreras has assured that "the money should go to important things" and for now they have already shown that after getting the 15,000 signatures required to present themselves at the elections, they have not spent a penny on advertising.
We are going to try to convince you that it is necessary to act fast and take our problems seriously, and we are going to denounce everything that imposes obstacles for this.
If our proposals are rejected, those who reject them will have to justify themselves before their citizens.
We are willing to join efforts with others and welcome those who will join our proposals.
Below is a video about the vision and missing of the new Association of Voters with Disabilities and Rare Diseases group :

As former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) implodes amid infighting for the party leadership, Zimbabweans took to Twitter and found humour in what others have described as a “Greek tragedy.”
Rebels within the party led by MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti suspended Morgan Tsvangirai and other senior officials accusing them of resisting leadership change and failing to oust president Robert Mugabe.
Tsvangirai says that he is still the party leader.
Zimbabweans, who call themselves “Twimbos”, had a field day suggesting titles for an imagined book about Tsvangirai, and the wisecracks came fast and funny.

Alain TOSSOUNON of Benin posted on the West African Network of Journalists for water and sanitation (WASH) blog a summary of the report on the evaluation of post disaster needs in Benin after the recent major floods.
The disaster caused the death of nearly fifty people and caused damage estimated at 78.3 billion FCFA (about 160 million USD) :
Today, anytimes the rain starts to fall, I'm geeting scared and anxious " says Elizabeth Kpossou, a resident of the village.
This feeling is shared by her neighbor and friend, Alice Codjo.
However, a few years ago, periodic floods were part of the lives of these peaceful communities.
And far from being a plague, they had found an opportunity with the fertile soil after the withdrawal of water from the floods.
Now, those days are gone.
"Everything changed" says the village chief, Samuel Boton.
"Now, floods are more devastating" Indeed, like in this village of Adjohoun with its 56 455 inhabitants, the entire country has been hit hard by the disaster.
Across the country, the toll was heavy in human loss and material damages.
There were 46 deaths and more than half of the municipalities were affected (55 municipalities affected of the 77 in the Benin).

Is it easier to condemn rape when it happens elsewhere?
How about when it happens right across the border?
The #MenAgainstRape hashtag started trending again, this time in Pakistan, reportedly after Babulal Gaur, an Indian state minister, said this about rape, 'sometimes it is right, sometimes it's wrong'.
Hundreds of young men from Pakistan started standing up to join the hashtag campaign.
A Pakistani Twitter user whose handle baysharam translates to shameless joined in saying:
Remember that five-year-old girl who was raped in Lahore, last year?
Her rapist(s) are still out there.
Amongst us. #MenAgainstRape — Dil-emma (@baysharum) June 8, 2014
When the 2012 Delhi gang-rape story hit the news wires, hundreds of tweets emerged from Pakistan condemning the barbaric incident.
Some spoke about India's rape problems while others looked at the rising instances of rape in the South Asian region.
It was a story so horrific that it garnered world media attention for weeks and since then an increase in coverage of rapes in India is evident.
Indian Blogger Krshna Prashant took the myths regarding rape head on, in her scathingly satirical piece:
He wobbled in at 11pm.
She did the dishes quietly, her heart racing as she heard his footsteps get closer.
Tears stung her eyes as he put his hands on her waist.
She could smell the whiskey on his breath.
He tugged at her pallu, letting it fall to the ground.
Not today, she begged.
Her back ached and her head felt like it was going to explode.
He grabbed her hair and pulled her to their bedroom.
She scrambled to find her pallu as they walked past the hall.
Their son stared in horror.
He shut the door behind him and slapped her.
He told her to stay quiet and take her clothes off.
She did as she was told.
What do you mean my son raped his wife.
There is no such thing.
This, is a refreshing and powerful stance against violence, however a closer look at the tweets reveals many of the myths Prashant addressed.

Rape is the most despicable, disgusting and vile thing a person can do.
Accusing the Rape victim for provoking for Rape is as the same as accusing a Murdered person for their own murder. #MenAgainstRape — Anas Mallick (@AnasMallick) June 8, 2014
While many feel that this trend is a step forward as men stand up against violence, others have questioned the effectiveness of a Twitter trend on real life circumstances.
Will it change the way rape survivors are seen in the society?
Will it stop rapes from happening?
Will it provoke law enforcement agencies into action?
These are some of the questions being raised.
Whether you are on the cynical side of social media trends or an enthusiast, discussions like #menagainstrape provide a small window in to young minds and their perceptions about sexual violence.
Karachi Airport employees being escorted out of Jinnah International Airport.
Photo tweeted by @Dawn_com
Last update at 04:50 GMT, June 10.
Following hours of digging, seven more bodies were recovered from a collapsed cold storage facility at Karachi's Jinnah International, 32 hours after militants launched their six-hour siege at Pakistan's busiest airport, bringing the death toll from the brazen attack to 36.
According to Pakistan's leading English daily Dawn, the employees had taken refuge in the cold-storage facility to escape the carnage, but a wall of the warehouse collapsed trapping them. They were in contact with their family during the attack: “We are looking into this and according to the families some seven people were trapped inside the cold storage and were in contact with the families on cell phone,” said Abid Qaimkhani, a spokesman for CAA (Civil Aviation Authority).
Earlier last night, the families of the seven airport workers had blocked Shahra e Faisal demanding that authorities work towards freeing their relatives who were trapped.
The militants reportedly entered from an old terminal reserved for cargo and VIP movement, with fake Airport Security Force IDs, automatic weapons, grenades and RPGs.
The airport reopened for travel, 17 hours after the initial attack.
No passengers was killed in the brazen attack.
Eighteen people from the airport staff, Pakistan's national airline and security forces were also killed. The Siege
One suicide bomber blew himself up during the attack. All passengers who were stranded in aircrafts during the siege were safely moved into the main terminal building after the initial siege ended.
Militants also damaged three empty parked airplanes. Photo tweeted by Twitter user @ahsannagi #KarachiAirport.

In the past few weeks, hundreds of Sub-Saharan immigrants from Mali or Niger have migrated to Algerian cities by the Eastern border.
Liberté Algérie narrates the stories of those who made the choice to immigrate and why :
The living conditions in the shed of the city of Bourroh are inhumane.
Inside the shed, Sub-Saharan immigrants have pitched about sixty tents.
Inside each (very small) tent, they all live together, tight against each other, all members of the same family.
Meriem and Aisha are two sisters aged respectively 10 and 12.
With their mother, they fled their country of origin, Niger, because of poverty.
"We left our country because we did not have enough to eat' Meriem says.
Also from Niger, Sakina, her daughter Asma and her two grandchildren are refugees in Ain Guezzam in the wilaya of Tamanrasset, at the extreme south of the Sahara desert.
In a hesitant arabic language, Sakira tell us that they are part of a group who fled the rampant famine in Niger.
Fifteen-year-old Samkeliso Kimbinyi of Zambian origin but based in the United Kingdom, is creating a buzz in the information and communication technology (ICT) world by becoming one of the youngest Microsoft Qualified Professionals in Europe.
The teenager, better known as Sam, is a Year 10 (high school level) student at the University Technical College (UTC) in Reading, a town just outside London.
He is now a Microsoft Certified Professional and has Microsoft Technical Associates (MTA) certificates in seven areas including Software Fundamentals, Windows Development Fundamentals and OS (operating system) Fundamentals.
Kimbinyi has also developed an app called Lite for Windows phones and has so far received positive reviews for the same.
Sam Kimbinyi's photo, taken from his Twitter profile.
Global Voices Online caught up with Sam on email and learned from him first-hand about his achievements:
In March this year, I had the opportunity of meeting staff from Microsoft offices in Seattle, who were in the UK for one day as part of their European trip to speak to clients who are training through the Microsoft IT Academy.
These were members of the Learning Experience team - Senior Director Tim Sneath, Director for Academic Programme Keith Loeber and Content Director Briana Roberts.
On May 26th 2014 I published my first App—Lite—on the Windows Phone Store.
I got the idea of the app after spending long hours of looking for a fast lightweight flashlight app that did not contain ads .
Eventually, after not finding anything, I decided to make my own.
Eight Days later and with the criticism (sic) from the Reddit Window Phone Community, I reached 300 Downloads and a 5 star rating.
Shortly after, the app got a spot on the “New and Rising” Section of the app store.
In future I hope to release many more apps and continue to study Computer Science at (the) university.
In his college newsletter, Kimbinyi was quoted as saying:
MTA training links to what we're learning in class, but has given me a greater understanding of programming and how diverse the field is.
My new knowledge was really useful when we developed an app during the Microsoft employer project; we ended up developing a much better app.
Microsoft congratulated Kimbinyi in a tweet:

At the "Second Kissing Sit-In or 'Besada' for Diversity and Equality" in Havana, Cuba, people "put the Revolution in a Kiss", and these kisses most certainly are revolutionary.
However, the second edition of the "Besada" comes at a time when controversy has arisen around the exclusion of discrimination based on gender identity in the new Labor Code.
The Rainbow Project or Proyecto Arcoiris, an anti-capitalist and independent project, organizes the activities in Havana, Cuba, on June 28th, LGTB Pride Day, to commemorate the Stonewall Inn riots, which marked a historical moment for LGBT rights which occurred in New York in 1969.
On the same date in 2012, Arcoiris organized the first "Besada," and nearly 50 people participated in that event in the vicinity of the sports arena Ramon Fonst, in the municipality Plaza Havana.
This time it will was held in Plaza Vieja, in the capital city.
The organizers explained the rational behind this flash mob style action:
Kissing in public should be everyone's right, but many view it as a public scandal, if it happens between other individuals besides heterosexuals.
When we as men and women kiss, for love or fraternity, we exercise our equality as citizens and we display the double standards that spark homophobia, sexism, the discriminatory attitudes that mark the root of our culture and which we must change.
In addition to being published in the blog of Arcoiris, the message was distributed on various internet sites, among them Cubainformacion.tv.
Furthermore, several magazines published on the Island, such as La Jiribilla and Cuba Contemporánea, have written about this event.
The letter convening the event adds:
Because a revolution means changing everything that needs change, and we defend the idea of an anti-capitalist, revolutionary and democratic society.
Join us and celebrate the Labor Code, Law No 116, and for the first time, the protection of homosexuals.
Come and demand a public explanation addressing the elimination of gender identity issues and status regarding HIV, in the same legislation, although the National Assembly did not approve it.
On this date, the color of your skin, gender, gender identity, religious or political beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, disabilities nor any other distinction do not matter, but what does is the faith in equality of all forms of love, forming a family, reproducing, being committed... all forms of BEING PATRIOTIC.
On June 28th, put the Revolution in a Kiss
The context in which the "Besada" is taking place is the recent enactment of the new Labor Code, which excluded the recommendation of Mariela Castro Espín, member of the Cuban Parliament and renowned Cuban investigator, of including gender identity as a motive of discrimination in the work environment.
Several journalists and bloggers have expressed their disagreement on the outcome of the new Labor Code, which went from being discussed to being published in the Gaceta Oficial de la República de Cuba (Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba) without the approval of the final changes.
Castro Espín addressed this issue on the National Center for Sex Education's website,(Centro Nacional de Educación Sexual 'Cenesex'), the institution which she also leads.
Members of Project Arcoiris sent a letter to Esteban Lazo Hernández, chairman of the National Assembly of People's Power.
Below we share this document in its entirety:
Havana, June 23, 2014
56th year of the Revolution
To: Esteban Lazo Hernández
Chairman of the National Assembly of People's Power
Colleague:
The official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba has recently published the definitive text of the Labor Code, Law No 116, and we would like to be clear regarding the reasons for the absence of certain elements that many individuals wished to have seen on this legal provision, after the discussion and approval of this law, by the highest legislative body, which you are head of.
Our entire town watched, on Cuban Television, the debate concerning this legislation as it went through Parliament during its ordinary meetings in December 2013.
That specific analysis was followed by several proposals from the Parliament member Mariela Castro Espín, who was the spokesperson with a set of approaches from workers and activists as part of the public consultation process of the drafting of the Law.
Amongst those suggestions were the inclusion of gender identity and HIV status as motives for which it is never admisible for a human being to be discriminated against in a work environment, which fall within the fundamental principles that govern our labor rights, in section B, Article 2 of that legal document.
Nonetheless, despite the support of these declarations from other members of the Parliament, and the intervention of Cuban vice president Miguel Díaz, who advocated for taking into account the already mentioned and entrusted the mandate to a parliamentary commission, those two aspects do not appear in the already published legislation.
This issue alarms us, not only because it implies an alleged ignorance of the will expressed by several members of the National Assembly of People's Power, as well as how serious this could be in relation to the democratic principles and procedures that should apply to the Parliament's ability to function.
What most concerns us is the human and political importance that were ignored without any apparent explanation.
The transgender individuals are the ones who deal with the most social and labor discrimination in our country, nor has the stigma and prejudice towards individuals with HIV/aids been completely resolved, and also in regards to their professional abilities and the right to pursue any type of employment.
Henceforth, as citizens of this country, and also as human and sexual rights activists standing up for the idea of an anticapitalist, revolutionary and democratic society, we request a public explanation regarding the criteria which the already mentioned parliamentary commission followed in order to exclude, from the final version of Law No 11, the proposal to amend the draft of the Labor Code.
We thank you in advance for your efforts in responding quickly and with full transparency, to our very respectful and civic request.
Kind regards,
The members of Proyecto Arcoiris.
LGBT Collective, anti-capitalist and independent of Cuba.

Maite Oronoz during the confirmation process in the Puerto Rico Senate.
Screenshot from video posted by the Senate.
On Monday, June 23, 2014, the Puerto Rico Senate confirmed attorney Maite Oronoz Rodríguez as a Supreme Court judge.
The historic nomination marks the first time that an openly gay individual has been appointed to the country's highest court.
Oronoz Rodríguez, who is the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court, expressed her gratitude and pride in a written statement :
I am pleased that the democratic process has resulted in my nomination.
I am proud to continue to serve this country, this time from the Supreme Court.
My commitment to the country and to the constitution of Puerto Rico is unwavering.
Through me, the people of Puerto Rico will have an honest and fair judge, loyal to the letter of the Constitution.
I thank the Governor and the Senate for the opportunity to reaffirm this commitment.
The Senate's vote to confirm Oronoz Rodríguez fell mostly along partisan lines, with 16 votes in her favor and 10 against .
Among those voting against Oronoz Rodríguez was the only female senator, of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, María de Lourdes Santiago.
Santiago explained that her decision was based on Oronoz Rodríguez' involvement in a controversial case, when as the director of San Juan's Municipal Legal Division she defended the Mayor's decision to impose searches on every individual who would attend this year's San Sebastian Street Festival.
The searches were deemed unconstitutional in court.
The confirmation process was not without hitches.
After the vote that confirmed Oronoz Rodríguez as a Supreme Court judge, some senators requested a recount of the vote.
Amárilis Pagán (@AmarilisPagan), feminist lawyer and LGBT advocate, expressed her frustration with the process:
If it weren't for the rampant lesbophobia in the Capital, we wouldn't be in this mess over Oronoz' confirmation.
National embarrassment.
LGBT activist Pedro Julio Serrano praised Oronoz Rodríguez' conduct during the confirmation process:
Maite presented herself fearlessly - with all her identities in full view of the country.
Her appointment merits this same bravery.
It happened, at the end of the day, but in a tumultuous way.
We must proceed straightforwardly, without fear, faces to the sun, with respect and dignity.
As we LGBT individuals deserve.
As all humans deserve.
The new judge was congratulated by Puerto Rican Congress members Luis Gutiérrez and Nydia Velázquez via Twitter:
It's a great day for #LGBT equality & advancing civil rights in PR.
I applaud the Governor for nominating Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. — Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) June 23, 2014
Not only will Maite Oronoz make a superb judge but her appointment to PR's Supreme Court is an important step forward for civil rights. — Rep. Nydia Velazquez (@NydiaVelazquez) June 16, 2014
In a column for digital magazine 80 grados, queer activist Yoryie Irizarry (@CyborgYoryie) astutely observed that this historic moment is the fruit of the LGBT community's long fight for equality:
Contrary to what our allies may think, I've decided to think that this historic moment does not come to us courtesy of Governor Alejandro García Padilla.
We've earned this historic moment in the streets, in the legislature, in our communities and workplaces, educating, making ourselves visible, testifying, writing, signing letters, fighting, and working.
The public discussion raised by Oronoz Rodríguez' nomination highlights society's persistent fixation on the sexual orientation of public figures, to the point that fundamental issues, like her performance and knowledge, are taking a backseat.
In an article for digital magazine El Post Antillano, Jaime Pieras Castañer describes the problem:
The media coverage of the nomination focused too much on the social orientation of the nominee.
Apparently, it would have been fine if she weren't open about her sexual orientation, but she disclosed it.
Thomas Rivera Schatz, ex-president of the Senate, said in a heated speech in the Senate that herself brought her sexual orientation to public attention.
As if that has anything to do with her qualifications or with any of the factors that should be part of any discussion of Oronoz' gifts and talent.
Érika Fontánez Torres, lawyer, Law professor and editor of the digital magazine Derecho al Derecho, offers an interesting opinion in the magazine's podcast (at around minute 11:20):
There are some people who have responded to this discussion by saying, "No, it's not important, it's irrelevant whether or not she's a lesbian," but well, the first thing we should be saying is "Yes, yes, it is important"... yes, subjectivities are important in Court, yes, they do bring something to the table, yes, diversity is important when the judges are deliberating , and if an individual, like Maite Oronoz, has a life experience from that perspective, I would say that's extraordinary.

On the six-day photo-safari, she photographed the beautiful city and places nearby:
Taking route 3, after passing Comodoro Rivadavia and Caleta Olivia 300 km back, there is a detour that takes you to Puerto Deseado.
This is a coastal and port city in the Patagonia with cliffs, a large amount of biodiversity with birds and mammals and a series of coastal tours that takes us to the very well known Ria.
Magellanic penguins, rockhopper penguins, Patagonian sea lions, Peale's dolphins, cormorants, river dolphins, oystercatchers and terns are part the great variety of this place.
But beyond the fauna, Puerto Deseado is a city rich in history due to its train.

On the website LaMula.pe, Juan Carlos Urtecho explains his reasons for supporting the Ivory Coast in the World Cup match with Colombia on Thursday, June 19:
From the moment they defeated Japan in their debut, the Ivorians became my favorite team in this World Cup. You choose the spoiled ones via the simplest way.
Ivory Coast, located in West Africa, with a GDP of 19 million euros and a per capita of 967 euros is the third poorest country that takes part in the World Cup, after Honduras and Bosnia.
Japan's economy (GDP 5 billion euros and 30 million per capita) is the second after the United States.
Ivory Coast is a country struggling to recover after a bloody civil war that resulted in ten of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands displaced between 2002 and 2007.
Japan, is... well, it's Japan.

For the World Cup, the arrival of 50,000 Muslims from countries as diverse as Iran, Nigeria, Algeria, United States, United Kingdom, Malaysia and many others from the Gulf is expected. For sure, they all will pack the 80 some mosques throughout the length and breadth of this huge country;
And he adds:
In six out of the 32 countries in competition, Islam has a significative presence.
Among those countries we have Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cameroon, Iran, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.

Djouma and Amadou Moussa are Ibrahim's parents.
Djouma and Ibahim are the two lone survivors of an incredibly violent attack by militiamen that took the lives of 5 of Ibrahim's siblings in the Central African Republic, near the border with Cameroon.
The militiamen came while Amadou Moussa was away.
Djouma, 30, recalls the attack :
They found me with my children in the house; they gathered all the small children and slaughtered them with machetes.
They killed six people, including five children in my presence Ibrahim was among the six children they took.
When they hit him with the machetes, they thought he was dead.
Outgoing Managing Editor, Solana Larsen (L) will be succeeded by Sahar Habib Ghazi (R)
At the end of May we said good-bye to our long-standing Managing Editor, Solana Larsen, and welcomed our newest volunteer contributor, also called Solana Larsen.
Solana steps down from the Managing Editor position after seven years at the helm of Global Voices' editorial section.
"Personal reasons" is often a euphemism for other things, but Solana is genuinely relinquishing the post in order to devote more time to family, notably her two year-old daughter.
"It's best both for me and Global Voices," she wrote in an e-mail to the community, "to step down now and allow for brand new things to happen."
Solana's deft handling steered Global Voices' editorial through a rapidly shifting media landscape that saw blogging eclipsed by social networks as the primary platform for citizen expression.
We're happy she'll continue not only as a volunteer contributor, but also to work on special projects and represent us at conferences.
Solana leaves Global Voices' editorial in the excellent hands of Sahar Habib Ghazi, who joined us as Deputy Editor in June 2012.
Sahar, a journalist, blogger and activist who divides her time between the US and Pakistan, helped launch DawnNews TV and has reported for the New York Times.
While a John S. Knight Journalism fellow at Stanford University, she launched Hosh Media, an online youth journalism platform.
Sahar has been instrumental in developing Global Voices' style guides, codifying many of our editorial processes, and building our sub-editing team.
Most importantly, she's a highly skilled and deeply committed member of the community, whom we trust will take our editorial section forward, to the places it needs to go.

A lot has changed since February, when I did the last Top 50 most visited Kenyan websites list.
Budget airline Jambo Jet was launched, NMG’s county paper Nairobi News was launched and then killed off, entertainment website izvipi was relaunched and Sauti Sol released a controversial, but popular, video for their new song ‘Nishike”.
On the websites popularity front, there are a few changes as well.
Kenyan Post has overtaken Ghafla as the most popular blog in Kenya
Jumia, KRA, Career Point Kenya, Helb and Techweez have gone up the ranking.
Niaje, The Star, Orange and Michezo Afrika have gone down in the ranking.
Ben Kiruthi, KU, Kenya Today and Kopo Kopo have joined the top 50 ranking.

JM Casanueva, author of the blog SocialTIC, reviews the new trend in activism in Mexico that uses humor on blogs and social networks to reach a larger audience:
Humor has always been a successful tactic to transmit causes in an empathetic way (yes, someone who is not you or your fellow activists understands the problem) and reach larger audiences (yes, beyond the lxs groups of usual suspects that always retweet you).
Mexican activism in 2014 has had a good dose of humor by comedians that have used their talents, keenness and social engagement to impact society.

From Mexico, Katia D'Artigues, author of the blog Campos Elíseos (Champs Elysées), writes about the children who see themselves forced to emigrate on their own , and calls this a "humanitarian tragedy":
They are children who are pulled to cross the border by themselves.
They don't do it for the sake of adventure, but because most of the times they don't have any more choices, out of poverty; because they are looking to reunite with a relative, maybe their father or mother who is already in the United States.
Figures grow day by day.
They are already counted by the thousands and at least a hundred are put into custody every day, according to unofficial numbers.
She then adds:
How are those children? No matter their status and citizenship, they are children and have rights.
It's established already that they will be provided an attorney for free to assess their process, which obviously is one per child.
For now, there are only 100 attorneys who will start working by December this year or January 2015.
They won't be enough.
Carlos Thompson from The Chlewey Blog writes about the importance of teaching Maths in Colombia in relation to the poor performance the country had in international tests of quality of education :
Maths provide much more than the ability of countng the change at the store, or the specific abilities to be admitted into Engineering School.
Maths generate a mental structure that also benefits the physician, the social communicator or the socióogist, not specificlaly to be successful in their profession, but as citizens in a democracy and as individuals that have influence in a society.

The Global Voices community congratulates two treasured members of our community who are among the winners of the 2014 Knight News Challenge.
The results of the competition were announced today at the MIT-Knight Civic Media Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
This year, the Miami-based Knight Foundation awarded a total of US$3,466,000 to projects responding to the question: "How can we strengthen the Internet for free expression and innovation?"
Global Voices' co-founder, Rebecca MacKinnon, received $300,000 to develop Ranking Digital Rights along with colleagues at the New America Foundation.
The grant will enable Rebecca and her team to rate Internet companies on how well they protect the privacy of their users, and publish a global ranking to help encourage companies to improve their practices.
"People are using social media platforms, telecommunications services, smartphones from these companies," Rebecca said.
"What are their policies and practices?"
Rebecca added that Ranking Digital Rights was inspired by a conversation that took place at the 2012 Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, Kenya.
"I was brainstorming with a bunch of people about how we hold companies accountable, and Mohamed ElGohary said, "I'd like to see a list."
And other people continued to tell me the same thing."
Jillian C. York's Knight News Challenge-winning project will collect data about censorship on online platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
The project from the other Global Voices laureate, Jillian C. York, also takes on private companies, though from a different angle.
Jillian, who joined Global Voices in 2007 and serves on the board as volunteers' representative, was awarded $250,000 for OnlineCensorship.org, a platform she'll develop with colleagues at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where she's Director for International Freedom of Expression.
Currently in alpha, the platform will collect data about incidents of censorship on online platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, with the aim of helping society better understand and manage censorship and free expression issues.
"Many of us have experienced the phenomenon of social media companies taking down our content or deactivating accounts," Jillian said.
"It's really a global phenomenon.
I hope the Global Voices community will contribute to the data, which will enable us to show companies and the world the real impact of private organisations on regulating online speech."
44,000 Malagasy Children Die Every Year for Lack of Care.
Madagascan children by Yves Picq - CC-BY-SA-3.0
In Madagascar, 44,000 children under the age of five die each year, according to the latest UNICEF figures.
That number is the same as the population of all children five and under in the entire Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region of France.
It’s also the number of victims in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 15 times over.
The tragedy behind the number - losing a child - most often affects families of limited means.
Two groups in Madagascar are particularly vulnerable in terms of public health: children younger than five, and pregnant women.
According to the World Bank, half of all children under five experience delayed growth, "a larger proportion than in any other country in Africa."
The maternal mortality rate is estimated at approximately 498 per 100,000 live births, and the causes of death are many, including limited access to skilled staff during delivery, poor prenatal care, and lack of emergency care.
The health record is appalling, yet there is no shortage of initiatives to change the situation.
In Toliara in southern Madagascar, a school lunch project is helping to fight the problems of chronic malnutrition.
The organization Les Enfants du Soleil (Children of the Sun) houses and educates street children and children from needy families.
The children also receive a noontime meal in the school cafeteria.
Take a look at photos of children who benefit in this French-language YouTube video:
Other programs target specific problems such as sickle-cell anemia or malaria.
The organization LCDMF (the initials stand for Fight Against Sickle-Cell Anemia in Madagascar) works to make the population more aware of this genetic disease affecting 2 percent of the Madagascan people.
In the following video, the team leaders of LCDMF describe the past activities of the NGO and its objectives for the next three years.
Two of their objectives for the upcoming years are to give better access to antibiotics for sickle-cell anemia patients and to convince Malagasy political leaders that sickle-cell anemia ought to be included in the nation's public health priorities:
In an open letter to Prime Minister Malgache Kolo Roger, LCDMF stressed the importance of treating this problem, especially in isolated regions without modern health facilities:
This is a critical public health problem that has a dramatic impact on the neediest inhabitants in a region with nearly a 20 percent disease rate and where one out of five children with major sickle-cell anemia is not likely to survive past the age of five.
The problem can no longer be handled with half measures.
Because sickle-cell anemia is cross-disciplinary and involves all medical specialties, this disease alone illustrates how essential it is for you to immediately take stock of the healthcare situation in our backyard.
Much remains to be done
Another area with a pressing need for action is maternal health, due to rapid population growth in Madagascar.
For example, one out of five married women who wishes to space out or limit pregnancies has no access to family planning services (19 percent), and the abortion rate is estimated at one out of every 10 live births, according to the Madagascar National Institute of Statistics (INSAT) and the United Nations Fund for Population (UNFPA).
Despite these efforts, Madagascar is faced with certain weaknesses that hinder improvement in health indicators.
The source of poor and uneven health outcomes lies in the disparities in household incomes and physical access to health services.
Consequently, nearly one in four people (23 percent) with an illness did not seek care at a health center because they could not pay for it.
Availability of medication is also a real problem because the systematic failures in drug management and inventory tracking as well as distribution logistics hamper proper distribution of medications.
As a result, the wealthy use health services four times more often than the poor: 40.9 percent of total expenses in this sector were attributed to the wealthiest fifth, whereas 10.1 percent were paid by the poorest fifth, according to the World Bank.
Strengthen nutrition programs targeting the most vulnerable groups, and their access to adequate nutrition; Enhance efficiency of budgetary expenses; Improve management of healthcare human resources; Introduce risk-free delivery kits; Bring doctors back to health centers in rural areas.
The situation is dire but not desperate, at least not yet.
The proposed policies can be readily implemented if given the political will.
The Malagasy children have waited 50 years for their collective health to be at the top of the national agenda.
It is high time authorities are reminded that no respectable country would tolerate the obliteration of its future in such a manner, 44,000 times a year.
Even before the national team defeated the Netherlands to advance to the World Cup final, Argentina was celebrating.
July 9 is the country's Independence Day, and the day before archrival Brazil was knocked out of the tournament after suffering a brutal 7-1 loss to Germany.
The delight was especially palpable in Tucumán, a city that played a leading role in the Argentinian independence and was an important witness to the events of 1816.
There, the Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band played a taunting song called "Brasil, decime qué se siente" (roughly translated as, how about that, Brazil!) that has become popular this World Cup.
The lyrics, set to the melody of Creedence Clearwater Rival's "Bad Moon Rising," refer to Argentina's win over Brazil in the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
That match remained goalless until the final minutes when Diego Maradona passed the ball to Claudio Caniggia, who managed to score on Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel.
Argentina went on to lose to West Germany in the final:
Brazil, tell me how it feels to have your daddy home / I swear that even though time passes by we won't forget it / that Diego dribbled past you and Cani scored on you / you have been crying since Italy / you'll see Messi bring us the cup / Maradona is greater than Pelé.
News and video of the military band's musical jab spread quickly on Twitter.
The blog Acordes 21 posted the chords for anyone who would like to play the song.
The fans behind the song are Ignacio Harraca and Patricio Scordo.
Harraca explained to Argentinian newspaper Clarín that after confirming that they had tickets to see Argentina play, him and a group of friends wanted to do something different to celebrate.
Once they finalized the lyrics, they circulated them on social media and distributed them on paper.
They debuted the song in front of the team's hotel the night before the Bosnia match:
We distributed the leaflets, and when there was a bit of silence we began to sing it.
A while later, everyone had caught on and for like 40 minutes you could hear non-stop.

The last time that Argentina reached the final of the World Cup was 1990, when the tournament took place in Italy and West Germany was crowned the champion.
After winning against the Netherlands in a penalty shootout 4-2 on July 9, Argentina will advance to the final once again and dual Germany for the title on Sunday, July 13 in the Estádio Jornalista Mário Filho, better known as the Maracanã.
Esteban Blog summarised the match like this:
A match with a rich tradition of finals approaches, with Germany demolishing the host 7-1, during which Brazil lacked the heart that the Argentines and the Dutch had in excess.
The most iconic locations in Argentina were transformed into party venues and, unsurprisingly, the Argentines at Brazil's Copacabana Beach also celebrated:

In the city of Buenos Aires, the meeting point was the Obelisk, where the celebrations extended into the night:

In the city of Rosario, where Lionel Messi, Ángel di María and Maxi Rodríguez, three players from the Argentinian squad, were born, residents celebrated like this:

And this is how everyone celebrated in Villaguay, in the province of Entre Ríos:
Photo from the Facebook account of José Luis Raota.
There was a variety of trending hashtags on Twitter in the aftermath, such as #ArgentinaALaFinal (Argentina to the final), #EstamosEnLaFinal (We're finalists), #AlaFinal (To the final) and #SiElDomingoGanamos (If we win on Sunday):
#IfWeWinOnSunday The Country will be Partying again!
#IfWeWinOnSunday I'll stop missing school, I've missed loads of days
And an optimistic tweet:
#IfWeWinOnSunday get rid of the 'if' because it should be "WE (WILL) WIN ON SUNDAY
The Argentines want revenge, and now they only need to wait until Sunday:
Germany, look at your videos, notes, but you know what? there's unfinished business between us!
IP addresses inside the Russian government continue to be active on Wikipedia, where a computer at the Russian Secret Service, the FSO, revised the German entry for Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, changing the word "separatists" into "rebels."
The Twitter bot @RuGovEdits, which automatically logs all Wikipedia edits made from Russian government IP addresses, caught five separate attempts by an FSO computer this morning to make the "rebels" language stick.
The effort failed.
German Wikipedia editors reverted the article's language to the original text, every time.

A group of Ghanaians rallied near the president's office as part of a campaign dubbed #OccupyFlagStaffHouse to protest corruption and the country's poor economic situation and press the government to do something about it.
The peaceful march, organized in less than five days, happened on July 1, 2014, a public holiday that marked the 54th year since Ghana became a republic following British colonial rule.
The movement was launched on Facebook as OccupyGhana on June 28, and by July 1 it had over 3,000 followers in support of the protest.
It now has more than 6,000.
This comes in the wake of a series of backlashes against the government for the fast depreciation of the cedi since it tightened the country's foreign currency rules and eased them last month, and the shortage of fuel that led to long queues at petrol stations for about a week.
The tipping point was when the government allegedly delivered 3 million US dollars appearance fee in cash to the Ghana Black Stars ahead of their World Cup match against Portugal, a match that was lost.
The players had threatened to strike if they did not receive their money before the match.
The general sentiment after this incident was that government did not care for the people, escalating to outrage on radio, TV and social media platforms.
In the days leading up to the protest, the group OccupyGhana posted messages that explained their dissatisfaction with government and the state of things in the country.
On June 29, the group wrote on Facebook:
This evening I saw police pickups even loading and stockpiling fuel.
I saw the faces of taxi drivers who are doing work and pay and need to pay off loans struggling for fuel.
I saw anxious workers who leave for work at 5am and return at 8pm but get paid pittance for their Labour anxiously waiting in queues with gallons.
Then I saw the elderly couple with kids abroad who need fuel for daddy to go for the checkup, wondering where it all went wrong,
The bread sellers, beans sellers, kofi broke man sellers who couldn't get taxis to carry their wares, those who need every present they make to survive, Then I saw people like you and I, the Facebookers, the tooknown young middle classers, who greet our poor neighbors every morning with a wave and a condescending how are you?
Now anxious about how you can buy fuel, or pay for that mortgage, or service that car loan...
US-based Ghanaian rapper @BlitzAmbassador who has a following of over 19,000 fans, tweeted:

I have not forgotten that one of the greatest virtues of leadership is the ability to listen. — John Dramani Mahama (@JDMahama) July 2, 2014

In the days since the latest Israeli offensive against Gaza, protests have sprung up in numerous cities around the world to support Palestine and call for an end to the ongoing attacks.
Recognizing the need to demonstrate solidarity, a Tumblr has been created to document these protests.
The account, which is anonymous, states its purpose is to collect "Photos, videos, and reports from demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine during Israel's ongoing attacks and collective punishment."
These are images from just a few of the demonstrations that have taken place in countries around the world.

In Sagua La Grande
Activists in Cuba are "putting the revolution in a kiss" in support of LGBT rights.
The "Second Kissing Sit-In for Diversity and Equality," which was organized by Proyecto Arcoiris (Rainbow Project), an anti-capitalist and independent project, gathered about 60 people for the besada in one of the main plazas in Havana and about 15 people in own of Sagua La Grande in Villa Clara Province on June 28.
At the event, activists read the letter that Arcoiris recently sent to Esteban Lazo, chairman of the country's legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power, in protest of the exclusion of gender identity and HIV status as motives of discrimination in the work environment in the New Cuban Labor Code.
They also collected signatures at the besada.
Historically the LGBT community in Cuba has suffered discrimination and persecution, but they have made tremendous strides in terms of acquiring rights in recent years.
Still, much remains to be done.

"Summer reading" from Nipmuc media center.
Public domain
Summer is upon us.
It seems that in what has now become a worldwide tradition, a reading list is de rigueur before you step away from all your online devices and return to a more slow-paced type of readings.
If one of your goals for this summer was to get (re)acquainted with Francophone authors, look no further.
Without further ado, here are a few book suggestions from our GV Francophone contributors.
Andrew Kowalczuksuggested the following top ten of books originally written in French.
The list is a collection of some of the most outstanding opus from (mostly) contemporary Francophone authors.
Most of them are also available in English (see links for translations):
Voltaire - "Candide" (I keep going back to this!)
Laurent Binet - "HHhH" (stunning in so many ways) Zola - "Thérèse Raquin" (macabre and ahead of its time as is Candide!).
Yet Francophone literature is also enriched by authors from outside France.
Thalia Rahme pointed towards a book from Lebanese-born French author Amine Maalouf.
She also takes the opportunity to recommend books on her current reading list that are not from Francophone authors such as, Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Iran's Khaled Hosseini:
Amine Maalouf - "Identites Meurtrieres" (for his take on dual culture); "Samarcande" (on Iranian literature and poetry), Gabriel Garcia Marquez - "100 Years of Solitude" Khaled Hosseini - "The Kite Runner"; "1000 Splendid Suns"; "And the Mountains Echoed"
Building on Thalia's list, Alison Mcmillan recommends a few remarkable novels from Asian authors: Vikram Seth - "A Suitable Boy"
Kiran Desai - "The Inheritance of Loss" Front cover art for the book "A Suitable Boy."
Oh, "A Suitable Boy" is one of my favorite! I am in my "poetry" phase and I cannot let go of Paul Eluard lately.
I am also re-reading the biography of Gabriel Garcia Marquez , "Living to Tell the Tale"
And for what it's worth, here is my own list of French books to read this summer:
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandes launched the program "Desarrollemos Honduras" (Let's Develop Honduras) alongside civil servants and community members.
Hernandes explained that if a house has a damaged or a dirt floor, it should be replaced with a cement floor; or prioritize according to the family needs, and:
Replacing traditional stoves for ecologic stoves.
I am aware that in many places, maybe not here, it's sad to ask people how much do they pay for firewood and they don't know, we have to explain them (...).
Sometimes, people pay more for firewood than for food.
Twitter users posted pictures and their opinions:
LET'S DEVELOP HONDURAS started today at El Reparto community.
Painting my neighborhood program will create 150 positions for young people from the community.
This is definitely worthwhile, let's all collaborate so it all might look better.
Let's Develop Honduras.
Indonesia's President-elect Joko Widodo or Jokowi delivered a victory speech recognizing the spirit of voluntarism among citizens:
This presidential election has sparked new optimism for us, for this nation.
Free souls and political responsibilities blossom within the souls of the new generation.
The long-lost voluntarism is now back with a new spirit.
And in the spirit of promoting "volunteer participation", Jokowi asked Facebook users to vote and choose the 34 Cabinet ministers he should include in his government.

Can a Hug Help Unite Generations?
A HUG Campaign Poster.
Image courtesy HelpAge India
For centuries, the joint family tradition in India meant that several generations from grandparents to grandchildren lived under the same roof.
With India's rapid development, however, the country's social fabric is changing.
More and more Indians are living in smaller family units, and younger people are migrating in search of better opportunities.
This has led to an increasing number of senior citizens being forced to live alone.
Many of them face isolation, neglect and loneliness.
One heartwarming campaign is trying to help.
HelpAge India's HUG - Help Unite Generations encourages India's youth to befriend an elder and share a hug with the hope of building "inter-generational bonding and to increase the empathy of young adults towards elders".
HelpAge India, a non-governmental organization that works for the cause and care of the elderly, explains on their advocacy page how young people can make a difference:
Whenever you see an elder person sitting all alone, look again!
He or she may be in your family or neighborhood or someone you’ve seen many times and is always alone.
This person has one need that you can fulfill.
With just one word, one smile, one HUG!
Just give them a little bit of your time.
These are the gestures that an elder seeks but often does not receive.
The HUG Campaign encourages you to simply give a call, listen to experiences, ask how the day was and share your stories with your elder friend.
The campaign posted a tear-jerking video showing what sharing a hug might look like:
Indians are living longer, and the number of silver citizens is increasing. According to a 2011 Government of India report , India's "grey population" (defined as 60 years old and up) is likely to increase its share of the total population from 7.4 percent in 2001 to 10 percent by 2026.
Manjira Khurana (@KhuranaManjira), Country Head, Advocacy & Communications at HelpAge India, believes that efforts like this could help sensitize young people to the needs of the elderly.
In an email interview with Global Voices, she spoke about her aspirations for the HUG campaign:
An occasional coffee, an outing once in a while and a phone call changes lives.
The Elder is happy and the Younger maybe finds that the Elder can be Cool as well!
That will maybe influence this youngster to be more sensitive and kinder to elders in his later life.
The HUG campaign asks young adults to also share their experiences and photos.
Shreya Misra, a fellow at Teach for India, shared a photo on HelpAge India's Facebook page, which shows her hugging her grandfather.
"I am sharing a hug with my grandfather.
Its such a wonderful feeling to see him smile."

They say that no man is an island.
Certainly, the elderly do not deserve to be marooned on the island of loneliness and abandonment in their silver years.
Today, 50 percent of India's population is below 25.
Is this young population listening?
And more importantly, will they take action now so that the elderly feel cared for, loved and wanted in the sunset years of their lives?
I, for one, sincerely hope so.
Never worry about numbers.

After news broke out about the Malaysian Airlines MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine, Singapore Airlines posted this message on Facebook and Twitter:
Customers may wish to note that Singapore Airlines flights are not using Ukraine airspace. — Singapore Airlines (@SingaporeAir) July 17, 2014
Many netizens accused the airline of being insensitive.
Sophie Chang commented on Facebook that "a better way for the airline to do is to express condolences first."
But Stephen Chapman believes that the statement "was intended to bring calm in a general sense."
Ryan Ik appreciated the clarification but he also felt that "without any words of sympathy, the update feels very cold."
Insensitive or not, this short update has since then become a viral message in a matter of hours.

Email Self-Defense, a beginner's guide to email encryption by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), was released in six new languages on June 30, 2014.
More languages are underway.
Even if you have nothing to hide, using encryption helps protect the privacy of people you communicate with, and makes life difficult for bulk surveillance systems.
If you do have something important to hide, you're in good company; these are the same tools that Edward Snowden used to share his famous secrets about the NSA.
Edward, a friendly email bot, helps Email Self-Defense users test their new encryption systems.
"Email Self-Defense is only one important piece of the solution to bulk surveillance," FSF states:
While we learn email encryption tools, we also need to push politically to reign in surveillance, build a safer Internet, and force governments and companies to reduce the amount of data they collect about us in the first place.
We hope translated versions of Email Self-Defense can be the entry into this multifaceted movement for people all around the world.
Leila Dee Dougan shares a music video from the latest album by the South African artist Umlilo:
Umlilo (previously profiled on Africa is a Country here) continues to push societal boundaries, crushing the norms of sexuality and gender roles with ‘Magic Man’, a track from his latest album, which will be released in July 2014.
Watch the making of the music video and hear his thoughts on circus troops, being an outcast and how his music has become his freedom.
Sada Tangara, a photographer and blogger based in Dakar, Senegal posted a photoreport on the rise of vigilante justice on the streets of Dakar, capital city of Senegal.
He explains the genesis of his project and why this type of popular justice is prominent in Dakar :
In Dakar, when an angry crowd manages to catch a delinquent that has just committed an infraction or a crime, he is systematically beaten, and is often seriously injured and may even die.
I wanted to understand this cycle of violence and to show the disproportionate violence that some of these delinquents suffer as a result of their actions For the people of Dakar, this type of popular justice is a way to scare potential perpetrators and to deter them from coming back to their homes.
Palestinian Al Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, unveiled three models of unmanned drones today, which it said it flew into Israeli skies.

Young man play the music of love,
Bride flirt a little more,
Dance your happy moves because it is wedding day,
We will sing our wedding song, Today we are celebrating.
Weddings are incredibly important to Turkmen.
Marrying off sons and daughters symbolizes the continuation of community life and the supremacy of the family in society.
Traditionally Turkmen have big families and a wedding is a chance to see even the furthest-flung relatives, as well as display your status to the neighbours.
A number of must-do rituals and traditions apply to a Turkmen wedding day.
Here is a short summary of things to observe:
1
You have to have a famous singer!
You are going to dance in the streets, da!
If you have near-exclusive access to the country's national gas wealth, you can hire J-Lo, but even if you don't your crooner has to get the people up and on their feet.
Below is an example of some top notch wedding singing from local star Kakysh:
The wind blows gently flirting,
The flower blooms gently flirting,
My beloved you will gently smile, My beloved today is our wedding day
On one of Turkmenistan's most popular chat forums, Ertir.com, users discussed the lyrics of the song.
NitrogeN praises Kakysh, and poses a question about a muse that appears regularly in his songs:
Kakysh sings well.
In many of his songs he uses the name Läle.
Maybe she broke his heart.
Meka MerGenius is also curious about the man behind the voice:
Right before the marriage they say all kinds of words, but don't talk too much after
NitrogeN continues, joking :
When they get married, they become fat, and the wind can't take them away anymore
2
A wedding dress should show the bride off because later she will wear a headscarf and close her mouth in front of husband's parents.
Wedding dresses in Turkmenistan are highly diverse, coming in different colors and patterns, and at different prices.
3
Turkmen families rarely fit into a single shot.
Screenshot from a YouTube video uploaded by Turkmen Owazy.

Also, make sure you take a photo in front of President Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov's portrait.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) has inquired whether this tradition is an official order or an unofficial practice.
The service quotes witnesses who confirm that the photo is an integral part of any official wedding ceremony.
This does not seem to create any problem for netizens, however.
Alex comments :
It's alright.
I would take a photo there too!
5
The most exciting part is always the build up to the ceremony itself.
The groom comes to take the bride from her house.
She is duty-bound to show her sadness because she is leaving her parents forever.
This is the most touching part of the wedding as the bride's relatives come to say goodbye to her.
A sad and happy moment all in one.
Unfortunately, this is the quote of the day.
2
Does it matter who did it?
Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy representative to the Russian parliamentary committee on international affairs, told TV Rain it didn't really matter who was to blame for the downing of the aircraft:
"What, will it make you feel better if you find out who shot down the plane?"
3
The sinister fifth column.
Bothered that Russian liberals and Ukrainian "propagandists" echoed many of the same sentiments (i.e., they criticized Russian policy in Ukraine), Konstantin Rykov of Russia's ruling political party had this to say:
In these moments it's very clear who is hoping for what and what they really want.. our liberals and Ukrainian propagandists striving for the same..
4
It's simple: blame nobody.
Russia Today's chief Margarita Simonyan chalked up the tragedy to good ole Soviet absent-mindedness:
I've been working at the very heart of various breaking news for so long, that I absolutely do not believe in conspiracy theories.
But I do believe in simple Soviet chaos.
5
Rebels?
What rebels?
Last but not least is the reaction of Vladimir Putin himself, who told ITAR-TASS that Kyiv is accountable for the skies over Ukraine's rebel-controlled east.
"Certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this terrible tragedy. This tragedy would not have occurred if there were peace in this land, if the fighting had not renewed in the South-East of Ukraine."

@Shahdan_shosh shares this photograph of 11 young men arrested for having Suhoor - a latenight meal to prepare them to fast the next day during the Muslim month of Ramadan (Source: Twitter)
A year has passed since the ousting of Egypt's president Mohamed Morsi and the new regime has already received a lot of criticism for the declining human rights condition which arbitrary arrest is a big part of.
In particular, the new gatherings law of Egypt has raised anger among Egyptians, many of whom have tried to challenge that law only to find themselves arrested, including some prominent activists such as Alaa Abd El Fattah, sentenced to 15 years in prison last month, for organizing a protest without a permit.
With the early days of the month of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Muslims, police forces raided a house where a group of 11 young men were having a sahoor (an end of night meal Muslims take before fasting for the day) party, apparently for violating the laws of gathering as some speculate.
Netizens started the hashtag #معتقلي_السحور , which translates to Sahoor detainees.
Ahmad Abd Allah posted on his Facebook wall the following :
Eleven people were having sahoor in one of their homes.
The Ministry of Interior arrested them for illegal gathering... free the sahoor detainees
Twitter user Mohamed Hazem, from Damnhour, tweeted in support of his friends:
I don't know if I should cry on the massacre committed by the republican guards or on my 11 detained friends
He sarcastically tweeted later on:
Will the Public Prosecutor consider the evidence as cheese and olives or will it make it as Molotov
And Shahdan-shosh tweeted a photograph of the 11 detainees and noted:
Their crime: a group suhoor.
They were arrested with foul (beans), falafel and yoghurt in their possession.
Activist Wael Abbas tweeted to his 265k followers:
I'll probably cancel my yearly Iftar party in respect to the new protests law :)
Anyway, half of those who I invited for Iftar last year are either in jail, in exile or are on the run :)
Last year, Morsi's regime was about to impose a similar law which prohibits gatherings which did not see light after an outcry from international organisations.
The Egyptian blog WikiThawra , which is run by the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights alleges that at least 80 people have died in custody over the past year and more than 40,000 people were detained or indicted between July 2013 (ousting of Morsi's government) and mid-May 2014.

In the wake of the tragic crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine, condolences have poured in for the families of the 298 passengers and crew members who were on board.
MH17 was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam when it was shot down by a BUK missile.
Many reports have pointed to pro-Russian insurgents mistakenly shooting down the passenger jet, but rebel leaders have denied this.
This is the second tragedy to hit Malaysia Airlines in a matter of months.
It lost flight MH370, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew on March 8 when it vanished from radar.
Reeling from the twin tragedies, Malaysian netizens are using the Twitter hashtag #PrayForMH17 to talk about the crash.
A Malaysia Airlines flight attendant highlighted the loss of lives on MH17 as well as MH370, sharing a picture on Twitter and Instagram:
Within 4month i lost almost 30 frends ... Sad but true we live in hostile world #mh17 #malaysia… http://t.co/n1aQ7ohPGp — HJB ® (@HJB__) July 18, 2014
Image shared from a Malaysia Airlines flight attendant's Instagram
Many politicians used Twitter to express their shock and explain what they think are the next steps forward.
Prime Minister Najib Razak extended his sympathies to the victims and their families:
My prayers today went out to the passengers and crew of MH17 as well as their families.
This is an extremely tough time for us all.
Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's minister of defence, tweeted the Malaysian government's priorities:
#MH17 @1MinDef : Our immediate priority - 1) Was d plane brought down? If so 2) How ? 3) Who ?
All our intel agensies have been activated . — Hishammuddin Hussein (@HishammuddinH2O) July 18, 2014
Malaysian Minister for Youth and Sports Khairy Jamaluddin stressed that blame should not be put on Malaysia Airlines for flying over a conflict zone:
We must oppose narrative blaming route selection.
FACT: many other planes were traversing same route.
FACT: ICAO approved the route. #MH17 — Khairy Jamaluddin (@Khairykj) July 18, 2014
Several renowned Malaysians also tweeted sympathies and shock.
Malaysian badminton player Lee Chong Wei was one of them:
My heart aches to see the family members and loved ones of #MH17 going through such a tragic and devastating loss. pic.twitter.com/2TJyMIB9LL — Dato' Lee Chong Wei (@lee_c_wei) July 18, 2014
Television presenter and radio host Xandria Ooi said that blaming will not help the cause:
Listening to the PC was painful.
So much implication that MAS flying the route was a mistake.
It's a TRAGEDY.
Blame doesn't help. — Xandria Ooi (@xandriaooi) July 18, 2014
Pang Khee Teik, organiser for Seksualiti Merdeka (Malaysia's sexuality rights festival), sent his sympathies:
In a senseless universe, senseless tragedies make sense.
In a senseless universe, senseless loving is my only salvation.
Hugs to all. #MH17 — Pang Khee Teik (@PangKheeTeik) July 18, 2014
Conspiracies about the crash are circulating in cyberspace, but for many Malaysians this is the time to grieve the loss of innocent lives and to help their loved ones recover from the tragedy.
A copy of the order to more than double the cost of fuel in Egypt.
Photo source: @AhmedKheir on Twitter
Egyptian netizens are fuming over a price hike in fuel prices, which they say will lead to an increase in transportation, food and services costs.
According to Ahmed Kheir, a Twitter user from Cairo, who has 2,200 followers:
92 Octane gasoline, up by 40 per cent
80 Octane gasoline, up by 78pc
Diesel, used by microbuses and transportation, up by 63pc
95 Octane gasoline, used by the richest segment in society, up by 7pc #social_justice
Those figures are echoed in this Reuters report, which states that the prices have been increased as the Egyptian government "tries to cut energy subsidies to ease the burden on its swelling budget deficit."
In another tweet, Kheir notes:
They have increased the price of fuel by more than half, in the absence of a Parliament.
They took the decision in secret on a day off.
All these actions are that of thieves.
Peter Ramez, who has 500 followers on Twitter, blames Egypt's new president Abdelfattah El Sisi, for the increase, saying:
A more than 40pc increase in gasoline prices you infidels?
May God's justice be met on you.
You deserve all the curses you will get
And Ahmed Fathi El Badry adds:
Do you think that people's love for you will mean anything after this decision?
This is truly a political and social suicide
Others have taken to humour to express their frustration.
Shay Sokar Bara, a pseudonym with around 83,000 followers, says:
I did not rebel against Morsi for the subsidies to be lifted or for the electricity to be cut or to donate .
I don't have anything and I don't want to go to jail if I say no
In another tweet, he notes:
Egyptians are lined up at petrol stations and everyone is saying they will fill up their tanks before gasoline prices go up.
We are a smart nation.
It is as if the fuel in their tanks will never finish
And Hesham Mansour jokes:
The increase in gasoline prices is a tactical increase.
After increasing the prices of fuel and electricity, the government wants to guarantee that citizens will not find any money to set themselves on fire
This tweet brings back to our memories the spark which ignited the Arab revolutions, in December 2010, when Tunisian fruit vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire.
Meanwhile, this video from Mansoura shows long queues of cars at a petrol station, which had run out of gasoline:
What does the future hold for Egyptians?
Abidjan and other regions of Côte d'Ivoire have been plagued by heavy downpour and floods for the past weeks .
Local residents got organized on social networks to bring relief to stranded citizens.
On twitter and facebook, #CIVSOCIAL is the hashtag for emergency humanitarian reliefs.
It was created in 2011 in the aftermath of the post-electoral crisis. The hashtag was revived again as floods marred Abidjan and the rest of the country.
The facebook page CIVSOCIAL has collected images, videos and testimonies as well as calls for donations for each afflicted borough.
Here is a video of one of the flooded borough :

The communications issue in Cuba is without a doubt one of the most followed and present topics in everyday Cuban life.
The improbability of having fast and affordable access to new global telecommunication services has become a popular theme amongst not only those on the island, but anywhere Cubans reside, because of the impact it has on relationships with family members and friends.
Various articles on Cuba's internet problems are circulating on Cuban networks recently.
Here are three of them:
ETECSA provides an explanation
Last Thursday, June 16th, officials from the Cuban Telecommunications Company (Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba, ETECSA), the only one in the country, participated in an online forum which was hosted by Cubasi.cu magazine.
In the presentation, ETECSA acknowledges:
The state of our services is frequently compared with the affordability and convenience with communication carriers from other countries, including those from Latin American regions.
As the necessary investments unfold, our company will reach more comparable measures in regards to quality and development, and the telecommunication's infrastructure will expand, making it possible to reduce costs and assimilate a stronger rate of growth and diversification of services.
In the forum, netizens' questions focused on national mobile telephonic services, cost and access to the internet, highlighting the impossibility of connecting to the Internet from Cuban homes.
In this respect, Yosiel, questioned:
Why is it not yet possible to make the internet accessible in the homes of Cuban residents at affordable prices?, and I am not referring to the typical infrastructure of the disastrous Modem into 56 Kb with the investments that it needs, in addition to what we already know is not good quality.
What I am referring to is why not put one or four good wireless network adapters so anyone can have access from home with a Smartphone, PC, Laptop, etc. to the web with similar speed to those in ETECSA centers.
ETECSA responded:
ETECSA's strategy foresees access to these services from homes; however the company's initial priority has been to broaden the collective centers in order to guarantee access to a greater number of people.
During these times, given the technical limitations, the immediate mainstream access to the internet is not possible.
Nonetheless, ETECSA is working on investments that will facilitate the implementation of these services with the required technical conditions and at lower cost than the current ones.
Restricted sites: Access today, perhaps not tomorrow
On June 19th, several individuals and the media confirmed that restricted sites were now accessible from the island, amongst them the popular Skype.
Other digital spaces like 14ymedio.com magazine by blogger Yoani Sánchez, which upon its inauguration was redirected to yoanilandia.com, and therefore impossible to visit from the island (raising considerable criticism) was now accessible from Cuban servers.
Revolico.com, a Cuban e-commerce portal similar to craigslist, was also accessible from the island.
Nevertheless, on June 20th, several individuals alerted on Facebook that these sites had been shut down again.
In Cuba, a popular phrase explains that "joy in the home of the poor doesn't last long."
Free access to the internet
Reasonably priced Internet access for the Cuban people is what Telecommunications engineer Norges Rodriguez, manager of the blog Salir a la manigua, is petitioning for on Change.org, addressing Cuban authorities, especially the Minister of Communications, Maimir Mesa Ramos.
Amongst the reasons for the request is:
New social practices brought by the internet are key and can only be compared with those that were offered, at their time, by the emergence of writing, the press, radio, telephonic services, and denying this would equate to the denial of development.
In this particular case, the novelty resides in the fact a blogger from the island has initiated an online campaign.
Previously, a petition with a similar purpose had been promoted In Cuba, we ask for reasonable prices for internet access from our mobile phones, but from Florida, United States, on the website Cubanet.
Gas extraction in Tanzania, as seen by cartoonist by Masoud Kipanya.
Originally published in Mwananchi.
Used with permission.
No one knows for sure how much gas there is in Tanzania, though estimates put the amount at around 51 trillion cubic feet (TCF).
But expectations surrounding gas exploration in Tanzania are soaringly high.
Across Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, both traffic and new construction are burgeoning.
The African Development Bank's (AfDB) designation of Dar es Salaam as the fastest growing city in East Africa is almost literally palpable.
The AfDB report, "Tracking Africa's Progress", predicts that the city’s population will increase from 4 million to 6.2 million over the next 10 years.
Predictions regarding the country’s economic growth are based on future income from natural resources, like gas from the region of Mtwara.
AfDB's forecast, for instance, makes reference to the potential jobs this activity will create.
Protests in January and May 2013, however, by residents in the port city of Mtwara, signal a lack of confidence that the future envisioned by the AfDB will also materialise for remote rural areas of Tanzania such as Mtwara Region.
The catalyst for the protests was the announcement of a decision by the government to construct a gas pipeline from Mtwara to Dar es Salaam instead of a gas processing plant in Mtwara.
The latter would have fed into an industrialisation strategy that would boost local development.
An incident in early July 2014 involving a production sharing agreement (PSA) between the Tanzanian Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and the Norwegian multinational Statoil, along with Exxon Mobil, highlights how fraught the question of revenues from Tanzania’s gasfields—and who will benefit from them—has become.
Though not directly linked to the protests in Mtwara, the TPDC-Statoil affair underlines a growing awareness among Tanzanians of the issues surrounding oil and gas, and an increasing dissatisfaction with the way the government handles natural resources contracts and communicates this information to citizens.
At the center of the matter is an addendum to Statoil’s original contract with the Tanzanian government for gas extraction in Mtwara Region that was leaked, then brought to the attention of the Tanzanian press in early July 2014.
According to media reports, under the terms of the agreement as outlined in the leaked document, the government stands to lose US$1 billion annually.
On social media Tanzanians wondered how the two multinationals had managed to strike such a good deal.
A cartoon by Masoud Kipanya published in the Tanzanian daily Mwananchi depicts a white man with a tank labelled "GESI" (Swahili for "gas") on his back, extracting gas from the ground while handing out pennies to a Tanzanian.
Another Kipanya cartoon shows a mouse saying in Swahili: “I wish that we would let our gas remain underground till our country reaches adolescence.”
Statoil's gas extraction project in Tanzania is one of the largest investments ever in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Writing on Africa Arguments, the analyst and blogger Ben Taylor claimed that the potential revenue from natural gas is on a scale that could release Tanzania from its heavy dependence on development aid.
“Another indication of the scale involved here,” wrote Taylor, “is that since the Norwegian government is Statoil’s majority shareholder, the extra revenue to the Norwegian government from this deal could be worth more than double the total of all Norwegian aid to Tanzania since independence.”
Zitto Kabwe, a member of parliament and Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, highlighted some of the leaked document’s key points in a Q&A on his blog, and critiqued the fact that the PSA was not made publicly available.
In a July 6 article in the Daily News the TPDC responded to Kabwe, asserting that claims that the country risked losing US$1 billion per year were unfounded.
Kabwe and others countered the TPDC’s comments on Twitter, and Kabwe called on the TPDC to clarify the terms of the deal.
According to a July 19 article in The Citizen, the TPCD confirmed its position in a press conference on July 16: "Outgoing TPDC managing director Yona Killagane strongly refuted the claims that the country would incur a loss of $1 billion annually if the pact is fully implemented as agreed.
Instead, he insisted that the government was likely to earn more money and that it stood a higher chance to benefit from the contract."
Tanzanians are not particularly pampered with regard to transparency around natural resources contracts, but this latest affair gives rise to even further mistrust.
Nor does it help when the likes of Patrick Rutabanzibwa, chairman of PanAfrican Energy, the company that runs the Songo Songo Gas and gas-fueled power plant in Ubungo in Dar es Salaam (also the former Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals), minimise the matter.
"We are failing to enter into resource contracts as it was in mining and currently in oil and gas because our capacity is very low,” said Rutabanzibwa.
“But if Tanzanians will be empowered then, contracts will be balanced. . . .
We should let bygones be bygones and start by legally making investment contracts in the natural gas sector public; I am sure there will come a day where all investment contracts are public.”
For stakeholders with particular interests in business and investments in Tanzania, criticism makes a challenging investment area like gas even more difficult, and some will even argue that it will result in less money going to neglected areas.
Others might say that regardless of Tanzania’s share of the revenue, there will still be benefits in the form of jobs and local growth in Mtwara.
Analyst Ben Taylor is less optimistic.
“One of the big political risks with oil and gas,” wrote Taylor, “is that it can be seen by politicians and senior officials as ‘easy’ money that doesn’t come with the kind of scrutiny that taxpayers demand when they pay their taxes and donors demand when they provide aid.
"Unless somebody – the media, politicians, civil society – steps up to fill the gap, decision makers in government will be left free to make whatever decisions they choose, unencumbered by any need to protect the public interest.
The Statoil PSA may well have cost Tanzania several billion dollars – yet it appears no-one is trying to hold those responsible to account.”
Palestinians say it is raining fire in Gaza, after Israel started ground operations into the besieged enclave tonight.
Home to about 1.7 million Palestinians, Gaza is bordered by Israel on one side and Egypt on another.
Both borders are heavily controlled, leaving residents with nowhere to run.
Critics of Israel's occupation have described Gaza as an open-air prison. On Twitter, Jehan Alfarra, with 8K followers, says:

Today is the 11th day of the start of “Operation Defensive Edge,” which has left more than 230 Palestinians dead, including women and children, and more than 1,500 injured.
From Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled the strip since 2007, has fired missiles into Israel.
Most of the rockets coming into Israel have caused no serious damage, due in part to the US-funded Iron Dome aerial defense system, which has intercepted at least 70 projectiles so far, according to the Guardian.
With the group operations, the casualties are expected to rise.
The Bahrain Ministry of Interior announced the arrest of yet another netizen, who reportedly faces accusations of "inciting hatred against the regime."
The satirist mirco-blogger, nicknamed Takrooz, was arrested at the Bahrain International Airport, while on his way back from Thailand, said the ministry in a statement on June 18, 2014, without disclosing his name.
A day later, many Bahrainis were fuming on Twitter, saying the arrest was futile and served no purpose other than to further demonstrate the government's true colours in stifling opposition voices online.
Scores of netizens have been arrested by the regime since anti-government protests started in Bahrain on February 14, 2011.
Among them are Mahmood Al-Yousif, Mohamed Almaskati and Global Voices author Mohamed Hassan.
Bahrain is regarded as an enemy of the Internet according to the Reporters without Borders' 2014 report and is ranked second in the number of detained journalists per capita in 2013 according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
With nearly 18,000 Twitter followers and 100,000 tweets, Takrooz has been an active voice in charting the government crackdown on activists.
Bahrain Watch, a research and transparency group, reported that Takrooz' Twitter account was repeatedly targeted for surveillance by the Bahraini government.
His tweets, in Arabic, cover abuse by law enforcement personnel, anti-corruption content and everyday concerns of the average Bahraini.
The next day Twitter user @M_Alshaikh published an image of an Arabic daily's coverage of Takrooz's arrest:
Government newspaper published an article about of the arrest of Takrooz in the first page #Bahrain @Takrooz
Lawyer Hanan Alaradi ‏@hananalaradi tweeted questioning his arrest status:
Will the owner of the account @Takrooz be released on bail like other pro-government tweeters @mnarfezhom
Bahrain had earlier arrested pro-government Twitter user, Mnarfezhom, who was released on bail, pending trial.
Mnarfezhom is accused of four separate counts of insulting and slandering people, attacking their honour and reputation and offending Bahraini families using indecent expressions through social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram under the names Al Raqeeb, Ahfad Al Waleed, Ahfad Omar and Mnarfezhom.
Many angry Twitter users have be inspired to tweet after Takrooz's arrest saying that such arrests are futile. @Lair_Vulnerable noted:
#Bahrain when you arrest .. a rebel, a tweeter, a photographer etc .. you're making a symbol out of him you fools and he will be stronger.
I'm the next Takrooz
Official sources say Takrooz has already confessed to running the account and that he will be put on trial for inciting hatred against the regime.
Ivory Coast-based Koaci.com has learned that a young Ivorian woman was found dead after having been reportedly pushed off the 6th floor of an apartment following a suspected feud with her sponsor concerning her salary payment.
Carolle Feby reports on Koaci.com that :
A young Ivorian woman of around 20 years old was found dead after having been reportedly pushed off the 6th floor of a building for demanding her salary in Beirut, Lebanon.
This was reported to Koaci.com by a young Cameroonian woman, after the revelations by her sister, who is a neighbor of the victim.
According to her neighbor, whose name can’t be revealed, the young victim was pushed out of the 6th floor of a building in Asharfir – Note: She might have meant Achrafieh -, a neighborhood in the city of Beirut in Lebanon on Tuesday the 1st of July.
She was asking for her salary and the man, refusing, apparently pushed her out of anger.
This young expatriate reportedly left the Ivory Coast years ago to work as a domestic worker in Lebanon, a common scenario for many young Ivorian women.
Stories such as this one are unfortunately very common in Lebanon.
A few months ago, after a revelation by Koaci.com that a group of African women were being tortured, they were successfully repatriated from Lebanon.
This unfortunately is a common occurrence in Lebanon and other Arab countries that employ the Kafala, or 'Sponsorship' system.
As explained by Human Rights Watch in its 2014 report on Lebanon:
Migrant domestic workers are excluded from the labor law and subject to restrictive immigration rules based on employer-specific sponsorship—the kafala system—which put workers at risk of exploitation and abuse.
While outgoing Labor Minister Charbel Nahhas announced in January 2012 that he would look at abolishing the kafala system, in 2013 Labor Minister Salim Jreissati failed to do so or to put forward legislation that would protect the estimated 200,000 migrant domestic workers in the country.
In July, a criminal court sentenced an employer to two months in prison, imposed a fine, and required her to pay damages and compensation to a migrant domestic worker whose wages she had not paid for years.
Migrant domestic workers suing their employers for abuse continue, however, to face legal obstacles and risk imprisonment and deportation due to the restrictive visa system.

Panamanian Joel Silva Díaz elaborates what many people wonder, especially men: how to be a good father.
On his personal blog he describes his challenges with his own father and his goals as a father:
I remember I considered a game to look for something to talk about, due to my lack of interest in sports we never had a conversation longer than five lines (rightfully registered for over ten years), but knowing other cases and stories, I at least had a father.
And that's what I want to improve,I want to be a father that does things without noticing it, I want to hug, kiss my children, present them the best option to make the best decisions and support them when they don't make the good ones, never hesitate in demonstrating my love and care, let alone when they earn a smack on the head.
As for me, I don't want a last name to last, nor a check every two weeks, my part has to be present, decisive and I want my child to have at least on only nice memory in their heart, as Salsa and the scent of recently trimmed off grass on Sundays at home.
Are you, or plan to be a good father?

2014 elections logo, via the Facebook page of the independent election commission As elections near in Tunisia, netizens are debating whether it is worth casting their votes in the upcoming legislative and presidential polls.
Tunisia' parliamentary elections will be held on October 26 while the first round of presidential poll is scheduled for November 23.
However, not everyone is as excited about heading to the polls later this year.
Those unwilling to vote often cite their dissatisfaction with the performance of the political class during the past three years, arguing that the 2011 elections 'did not bring any change'.
In October 2011, Tunisians elected a National Constituent Assembly (NCA) tasked with drafting a new constitution after the ousting of dictator Zeine el Abidin Ben Ali.
The Islamist party Ennahdha gained 40 per cent of the votes.
Like many, Nymeria wondered: What am I to do in #TnElec ?
On June 24, Twitter user Papillon, who has around 13,000 followers, posted the following question:
None those of who are encouraging to vote can answer this, yet very simple question: how was voting on 23 October useful?
Blogger Saber Arabasta, who has around 12,000 followers, answered :
Knowing the balance of the political forces in the country, changing the government, changing the president, drafting a constitution
He added in another tweet :
Debating laws, debating a budget, deciding on an electoral process and transitional justice and changing diplomacy.
User Chikh Magon asked :
I return the question to you: what would boycotting the elections be useful for?
On Facebook, Journalist and blogger Haythem El Mekki wrote :
So, those who are in favor of boycotting and abstaining, I would have loved to follow and support you but you need to tell me what have you concretely and permanently planned...What is the result you wish to see by urging boycott?
Apart from depriving us from the votes of those who wish to see a change more than anyone else...I am as unsatisfied by the political class as you, even more.
But I only see nihilism in your approach which I find destructive and childish...Could you convince me of the opposite?
Bechir Bizertino commented :
First of all, you explain to us, how taking part in the elections to choose any of the dirty parties imposed on us will change anything in the country.
For me, I am boycotting because my vote to any of the existent dirty parties is of no use and value since the entire political class only listens to foreign ambassadors and not the people who elect ...by boycotting, at least I'm not giving them any legitimacy and deputizing them so they cannot pretend
Zenova Gamha Fehmi posted this comment :
In my opinion, it is an obligation to vote for any party.
In five years' time, if we are still unsatisfied, we can vote to a different party and so on, this is the game.
Voting is an obligation towards those who died to grant us this right.
Do not expect a miracle after the elections, Tunisians tend to want to have everything immediately, which is impossible
In the meantime, the country's independent electoral commission (ISIE) launched a campaign urging Tunisians to register before July 22, if they wish to cast their votes.
Those who do not register will not be able to do so.
The campaign targets some 4 million eligible voters who did not register for the October 2011 constituent assembly election.
With a high abstention rate estimated at 50pc in 2011, the electoral commission and civil-society groups are concerned that this year's turnout rate will be lower in the face of a growing popular disappointment with political parties.
Abdoulaye Bah, Global Voices contributor and author of the Konakry Express blog has launched a petition to ask Pope Francis to take action against African dictators.
Bah, who previously wrote about his admiration for some of the Pope's political stance, denounces the credit granted by the Papacy to five African leaders by officially receiving them at Vatican City.
The petition asked for the same punishment for the dictators as what was recently bestowed on members of the Mafia when Pope Francis visited Calabria.
Your Holiness recently received President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, President Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, and President Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo.
These five presidents broke world records for longevity in power.
To do this, they have built oligarchies which pillage resources, kill innocents, rape women, torture opponents and defenders of human rights.
These oligarchies also corrupt institutions, pervert their people wishes during rigged elections, and divide populations by sowing hate and provoking uprising..

The first footage of the plane crash are now available thanks to a Burkinabe soldier present on the site of the wreck near Gossi, in Northern Mali.
There are no survivors among the 118 people on board, including more than 50 French nationals.
Algerian website Algérie Focus reports in French that:
The video shows scattered and crushed debris.
The sand at the site was blackened by the crash.
In the video, it is virtually impossible to identify the key components of the aircraft amid the debris.
This post is part of our campaign #FreeAlexSodiqov: GV Author Detained in Tajikistan.
Three weeks to the day since Global Voices author Alexander Sodiqov was arrested in Khorog, Tajikistan, his wife, Musharraf, has seen him only once.
Alex is an academic, not a spy.
Igor Shoikhedbrod speaks at the event for Alexander Sodiqov.
Photo taken from freesodiqov.org, a website set up by Sodiqov's colleagues at the University of Toronto.
Global Voices has been covering, where possible, the academic meetings held in support of Alex Sodiqov.
They are here, here, here and here.
Overall there were twelve meetings held for Alex.
On June 27 there was a meeting held at the University of Toronto in Canada, where Alex is a PhD student and Teaching Assistant.
Alex knows so much about Tajikistan’s history its culture and its institutions.
And he knows these things not as someone looking from the outside in, but as someone that has experienced those institutions, that history and that culture.
Aside from being a rising star in academia Alex is first and foremost a family man.
I remember one time asking him how he was on a morning when we had to hand in assignments and he said that he hadn’t slept because he had had to take his wife and his baby daughter Erica to the hospital because she was teething.
Alex did not spend that much time in the department because he wanted to spend all the time available with his wife and daughter.
One of the reasons Alexander was in Tajikistan aside from his scholarly interest in the region, was because like all TAs his contract ran out in April and he had to provide income for his family over the summer.
Last time I spoke with Alex and his family he cooked me authentic Tajik plov and promised to bring me a kazan (cooking pot) as a souvenir from Tajikistan.
It is my sincere hope that he can be released without delay and that he can be reunited with his family.
We need more scholars on Tajikistan like Alex.
The rest of the meeting can be watched here:
Zambia's President Tried to Prove That He's Hard at Work With These Facebook Photos.
President Michael Sata reportedly addressing a cabinet meeting upon his return from Israel where he was admitted to a hospital.
This is one of the photos that was sent to media houses and also appeared on the president's Facebook page.
When Zambia's President Michael Sata's team released photos of a supposed cabinet meeting to local media and published them on Facebook, it was meant to put to bed allegations that the leader isn't well nor working.
Instead, the images have further fanned the criticism, and some are doubting the authenticity of the meeting because there is no audio or video footage to back it up.
It began when Sata left the country unannounced on June 20, 2014.
The website Zambian Watchdog exposed the trip, reporting that the president had arrived in Israel and was admitted to a hospital.
The chief government spokesman then confirmed the trip, but said Sata was on a working holiday in Israel.
The secrecy surrounding the trip led to a protocol faux pas which was quickly picked by citizens.
A couple of days after Sata’s journey, the ceremonial guard and the presidential standard, an orange flag embossed with the coat of arms, both of which are supposed to be removed in his absence, were still in place at the presidential palace in the central district of the capital.
Nearly a month later, Zambians were in the dark if their president, who had in previous months appeared unwell, was back in the country or not.
The Zambia Reports wrote about the break in Facebook posts:
It seems everyone has abandoned their posts and is ducking responsibility.
Is it not ironic that after hyping up facebook updates coming almost by the hour daily basis on the President’s facebook page there has been no update from June, 6?
On Sata’s Facebook hiatus, Sikota observed with a touch of sarcasm:
There are certain things in life which are so sweet that you can never ever get enough of them.
I guess we all remember our first taste of honey and other delights.
One such sweet thing or delight is the regular diet we were fed on and became accustomed to is that of the lovely and affable Mr. president Michael Sata.
And who can forget those regular warm and very person+able updates on His Excellency's Facebook page? Most sounded like the one, which kept us updated on his movements, posted on the 4th April this year which read, "Good Morning Dear Friends, I have now started off my journey back home after a successful European Union - Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium.
I have left Brussels for Lusaka via Amsterdam.
Keep well and enjoy your Weekend.
Two days later, photos of a supposed cabinet meeting held on July 14 were sent to media houses and also posted on Facebook in a publication about ongoing country-wide projects.
A local TV station, Muvi, and the BBC doubted the meeting.
Blogger Chola Mukanga, on his Zambian Economist, refused to use the photos, saying:
Unfortunately, the Zambian Economist is not able to verify the authenticity of these three photos, which we understand are available at other websites.
We simply do not have visual or audio footage to go with the photos.
Therefore it would be irresponsible of us to share such photos and label them "official" as it may inadvertently mislead the public.
On Twitter, citizens weighed in on Sata’s absence:
So it seems despite publication of pics of "Pres Sata chairing a cabinet meeting" yesterday #Zambia is still asking #whereisthepresident? — Laura Miti (@LauraMiti) July 15, 2014
Another user wondered why no information was forthcoming:
To what extent should the Presidency be shrouded in mystery? #Zambia http://t.co/nvm5yv5ntN — Tchiyiwe T Chihana (@AfriWoman) July 12, 2014
The anger is culpable:
@AfriWoman This government is taking voters for granted.
Sata and his cabal are accountable to the people of Zambia not other way round. — David Mwanambuyu (@mbuyujr) July 12, 2014
In Sata’s absence, activist Brebner Changala petitioned the High Court to compel the cabinet to put together a medical board to examine Sata and determine his suitability to continue as head of state.
The matter was thrown out but Changala resubmitted his petition.
A few days before the supposed cabinet meeting, South Africa’s Business Day chronicled some of Sata’s unannounced international travels, which are euphemistically called working holidays by the president's office and other government officials.
Taking a quick glance at the criticism on social media, it doesn't seem that the euphemism is working.

On her blog Historias de una mujer lobo (Stories of a female werewolf), Natalia Cartolini reflects on the reasons why a trip can be beneficial as, in her opinion, "the fact of visiting new places or meeting new people from another perspective is important at any moment.
It doesn't matter if you go out within your own city or its surroundings, just open your eyes to a new point of view.
Do something different.
But as the further from what you are familiar with, the more you will be able to find yourself, as you are aware you are the only one needed to survive."
She ends up her reflections saying:
So, just imagine you listen to your favorite instrumental music as you walk down the streets.
Everything gets transformed.
Now you are the leading character.
For a while, you are a Gatsby, some other times, a cowboy or a mountaineer.
Who can stop imagination?
Just you.
Get out from your place and take the most out of what you have next to you.
Because it's all yours.

The war in Ukraine moves to Wikipedia.
Images mixed by author.
A day after a horrific plane crash in eastern Ukraine claimed the lives of nearly 300 people, speculation about who is to blame for shooting down the aircraft is in full swing.
Leaders of Ukraine, Russia, and even the separatists in Donetsk have all placed responsibility on each other.
In Kyiv, President Poroshenko blamed rebels in the east and criticized Russia for destabilizing the border.
In Moscow, Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv is accountable for anything that happens in Ukraine.
Donetsk’s putative leader denies any role in the attack on Malaysian Flight MH17, saying it must have been the Ukrainian Air Force.
Unsurprisingly, the blame game is now playing out on Wikipedia, where editors battle to record the polemics that best reflect their side of the story.
Earlier this morning, the Russian-language Wikipedia entry for commercial aviation accidents hosted one such skirmish, when someone with an IP address based in Kyiv edited the MH17 record to say that the plane was shot down “by terrorists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic with Buk system missiles, which the terrorists received from the Russian Federation.”
Less than an hour later, someone with a Moscow IP address replaced this text with the sentence, “The plane was shot down by Ukrainian soldiers.”
Thanks to a Twitter bot that tracks anonymous Wikipedia edits made from IP addresses used by the Russian government, we know that the second edit to the MH17 article came from a computer at VGTRK, the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company.
A Wikipedia article about commercial aviation catastrophes was edited by VGTRK.
VGTRK is the home of Dmitri Kiselyov, who is known informally as the Kremlin’s chief propagandist.
Kiselyov is notorious for his strong criticisms of the governments in Kyiv and Washington.
During the Crimean crisis, Kiselyov once boasted on television that Russia remains “the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust.”
In June, two VGTRK journalists were killed near Luhansk after coming under mortar fire while embedded with local rebels.
Nadiya Savchenko, the helicopter pilot whom separatists captured in Ukraine and transferred to Voronezh earlier this month, now sits in a Russian detention center, accused of participating in the attack that killed the VGTRK reporters.
The Twitter account that discovered VGTRK’s Internet activity, @RuGovEdits, is modeled on another bot, @CongressEdits, which tracks Wikipedia edits made from IP addresses in the US Congress.
The code for CongressEdits, created by programmer Ed Summers, is open-source software and can be configured easily to watch for anonymous edits from any IP ranges.

It also identified how travel and tourism “comprised another risk factor contributing to children’s vulnerability.”
The study covered Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.

Sixteen international authors who participated at the Palestine Festival of Literature, held from in several Palestinian cities from May 31 to June 5, released a statement condemning Israel's continued settlement construction and applauding the efforts of the Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) campaign.
The statement, shared on Facebook, reads:
"Having personally witnessed the injustice visited upon the Palestinian people in the territories occupied by Israel, it is with the utmost sadness and dismay that we - the undersigned international authors and artists - note Benjamin Netanyahu's approval this week of yet another 1,500 new illegal settlements units in the West Bank.
This is particularly unfortunate at a moment when the Palestinians have formed a unity government that has been recognized by the international community.
Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories have long since been pronounced illegal by international law.
The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories is itself illegal, and declared so by the international community through various UN resolutions.
Additional settlements can be seen only as an act of aggression, showing utter disregard not just for the human and civil rights of the Palestinian people, but for international law.
We applaud the non-violent efforts of the BDS campaign (www.bdsmovement.net) and express our solidarity with its demand that Israel should comply with the precepts of international law by:
1
Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab land and dismantling the Wall
2
Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and
3
Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.
We thus call for the Israeli Government to respect international law and reverse the approval of the thousand plus additional settlements units in the West Bank.
We furthermore call on the International Community to work to induce Israel to uphold basic principles of international law.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, crashed in eastern Ukraine Thursday evening, killing all 298 passengers and crew members aboard.
Most reports indicate that the plane was shot down by a missile approximately 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
The Ukraine government is accusing pro-Russian insurgents of using a BUK surface-to-air missile system to shoot down the plane but rebel leaders have denied this.
This infographic shows the flight path and crash site of MH17:

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak assured his constituents that those who shot down the plane will be brought to justice:
This is a tragic day, in what has already been a tragic year, for Malaysia.
If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.
The flight’s passengers and crew came from many different countries.
But today, regardless of nationality, we are all united in grief.
He also clarified that the aircraft’s flight route, even if it passed directly above a conflict zone, was declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

The MH17 crash was the second time that a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 aircraft went down this year.
On March 8, a Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane carrying 237 people went missing just an hour after it left Kuala Lumpur during its flight to Beijing.
The MH370 plane and its passengers have yet to be found.
A daughter of an MH370 flight attendant tweeted her message of support to the families and friends of MH17 passengers:
As the family member of the crew MH370, and on behalf of all them, we pray for MH17.
Josie Fernandez of Transparency International Malaysia urged a complete probe of the incident:
What has happened is unprecedented – Malaysia is the only country where the same carrier, the same type of planes have been involved in tragedies with loss of many lives within months.
MH370 has not been found.
Malaysia must demand for international action on this unprecedented tragedy.
This is a passenger plane.
We are not at war with any nations.
Writing for The Ant Daily, Alyaa Alhadjri described the shooting down of MH17 as a ‘mass murder’:
Why are commercial passenger jets still flying over a conflict area where airplanes have been shot down and warned to steer clear of the airspace.
Whatever the causes for another MAS Boeing 777 for going down a second time in 133 days, losing 537 people in two air disasters does not help lift passengers' confidence in the national airline.
As Malaysia grieves over another tragic crash, it seems inevitable that many citizens will again press the government to explain the mysterious disappearance of MH370.

Nine bloggers and journalists, four of them Global Voices members, were charged with terrorism and related activities before Ethiopia’s Lideta High Court yesterday.
Arrested and detained in Addis Ababa on April 25 and 26, they since have been behind bars on informal accusations of “working with foreign organizations that claim to be human rights activists and…receiving finance to incite public violence through social media.”
The defendants’ attorneys and families were not given prior notice about the hearing, and they thus had no legal representation present when the charges were issued.
The Zone9 Trial Tracker blog, run by sources close to the defendants, reported that the charges included working with organizations branded as “terrorist” by the Ethiopian government; participating in an email encryption training; and “underground organization.”
The bloggers' attorney told AFP that the charges have no "credible substance."
Supporters around the world expressed outrage over the charges on Twitter, under the #FreeZone9Bloggers hashtag.
Yoseph Mulugeta, a former Human Rights Watch representative in Ethiopia who has been following the case closely, tweeted:
19page fabricated charges but no mention of Zone9 by name.Not even once.The brand surely terrifies enemies of free speech #FreeZone9Bloggers
— Yoseph Mulugeta (@YosephMulugeta) July 18, 2014
Enacted in 2009, Ethiopia’s controversial anti-terrorism law is unfortunately familiar for political journalists in the country.
Journalists Eskinder Nega and Reeyot Alemu faced the same charge and have been held in Addis Ababa’s Kalaity prison since 2011.
Prosecutors reportedly issued the charge based on accusations that the bloggers had received training and financial support from two Ethiopian political groups based in Europe and the US.
Trial Tracker notes that the two groups are ideologically dissimilar.
According to news reports, the bloggers and journalists were also accused of organizing themselves clandestinely as the Zone9 blogging collective, a puzzling charge, given the public nature of the Zone9 blog and activities undertaken by the group.
The group has been given a trial date of August 8.

Like me, you may have pinched yourself to see if you were dreaming after watching Brazil's humiliating 7-1 defeat by Germany in the World Cup semifinals.
But it happened.
Bloggers from the Middle East and North Africa expressed their sympathy, with one Bahraini Twitter user wryly noting that the "tear gas" team was leaving in a "scandalous manner."
He was referring to the government of Bahrain's use of Brazilian tear gas to violently stop protests (warning, link contains graphic content).
Brazil will receive a minimum of $20 million for its semifinal run in the World Cup, but the team still has an opportunity to win an extra $2 million if it defeats the Netherlands, who lost to Argentina, in the third-place game.
This money may be sorely needed to make changes to its soccer association.
Protests continued in the country, but not at the same scale as the lead-up to the tournament.
Some 300 protesters in the city of Sao Paulo turned out to demand the release of previous demonstrators, yet the police responded by arresting six more.
Most fans traveling to Brazil will not have heard any baile funk (dance funk) because it has been banned for its popularity in favelas and for its racy sounds, which feature police sirens and gunshots.
Argentina fans, meanwhile, can rejoice because they will have an opportunity to watch their team play against Germany in the final as Lionel Messi, one of the all time greats, plays with heartthrob Ezekiel Lavezzi beside him in attack.
Lavezzi has attracted a few more fans after stripping off his shirt in a victory celebration.
With racism, it seems more is less.
The global soccer body FIFA has revealed internal divisions about cracking down on racism at the tournament.
FIFA's task force against racism disagreed with the ruling of its disciplinary panel to decline to punish national federations for racist and homophobic chants by fans because the fans were not targeting one player in particular, but entire teams.
Preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have already been marred by reports of as many as 400 Nepalese and 700 Indian construction workers dying in conditions that can approach 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).
However, one journalism professor in the country argues that the tournament should still be staged because it will allow for sustained pressure on Qatar to improve its human rights record.
He is also the co-author of one of the most comprehensive studies on social attitudes towards media in the Middle East, which you can read here in this fascinating interactive website.
His study was funded by the Qatar Foundation, the same organization that sponsors FC Barcelona, home of Lionel Messi.
The foundation is itself funded in part by the government of Qatar.
Still following?
You be the referee.
Sports pundits often talk about how they love to watch free-flowing soccer.
We're going to cheer for the free flow of ideas in the final.
May the best team win.

In view of widespread rumors regarding the health of Zambia's president, Michael Sata, Gershom Ndhlovu argues that the constitution mandates the cabinet to probe his health:
The last time Zambia’s President Michael Sata was seen publicly was on or around June 20 when he hosted a Chinese government delegation led by Vice President Li Yuanchao at the Presidential Palace.
At that time, Sata’s appearance was that of an ailing man, a confirmation of his scraggy appearance at the High Court a couple of weeks earlier.
When pictures of a seemingly sick Sata went viral on social media, one online publication, the Zambian Watchdog, reported that the President had been evacuated to Israel for treatment.
Obviously, the expose did not go down very well with government whose senior officials at the level of vice president and ministers issued all manner of statements ranging from the president being on a working holiday to wooing investors and meeting that country’s President Shimon Perez.
Upon his return to Lusaka, the president’s office tried to show him as working normally and even posted pictures of him chairing a Cabinet meeting.
The people were not convinced and called of the bluff, alleging that the pictures were photoshopped.
However, the most disastrous public relations stunt that spectacularly backfired was the picture of President Sata swearing in then Solicitor General Musa Mwenye who had been ratified by parliament for the position of Attorney-General but had been unsworn for weeks on end.
There had been concerns that Mwenye would not perform in his new role without being sworn in.
The picture which was published on the Presidential Palace Facebook page, supposedly with the aim of showing that Mwenye had been sworn in as Attorney-General, had in it a deceased individual and another one who had been posted to the diplomatic service two years earlier.
Blogger Antarik Anwesan recalls an alarming experience at Goregaon train Station in Mumbai, India.
A local train started from the platform without notice and the crowd hurried to get on board.
As the train gathered speed quickly, some people fell from the door and two persons were miraculously saved from death.
This was not reported in any media.
The blogger highlights that although the casualties in the local trains are much higher each year, the government is not making provisions for safety for the ever-increasing demand on the local trains.
The "Knock Knock" video was shot in one take and uses 14 different screens to tell its story.
Image from YouTube.
A little-known Ukrainian indie rock collective has captured the hearts of YouTube users—and Apple fans—with a cleverly shot music video that now has over half a million views.
The video must have taken a lot of preparation, since the authors say it was shot in real time, in one take, using only one camera, and did not involve any post-editing.
The result is an endearing love story set to an equally romantic soundtrack.
What it conceals, most likely, is hours of design and animation work, as well as careful choreographing of the gadgets on the table.
And, well, perfect timing.
As users continue to share the Ukrainian band's video masterpiece on the Web, some are jokingly speculating the video might secretly be an Apple promotion, since the devices play such a prominent part.
We wonder if Apple might take note: the song—and the video—would make a for great Apple advert.

Compared to a decade ago, before Facebook, Twitter and other social media took over, there aren't as many Japan blogs are there used to be.
A few gems still remain.
If you're interested in developing a more in-depth understanding of Japan, these blogs, many written by expert expats, are a great place to start.
SNA - Shingestu News Agency
More than a blog, Shingetsu is an independent news agency that has frequent updates and analysis about current events in Japan.
Headed by journalist Michael Penn, a frequent contributor to Al-Jazeera, the SNA Twitter feed is a good way to stay on top of breaking news in Japan.
Shisaku
If you want to truly get a good understanding of Japanese politics, Shisaku is a good place to start.
Written by scholar and commentator Michael Cucek, a resident of the Tokyo Metropolitan District since 1994, the Shisaku blog tries to identify the personalities and factions that power Japanese politics, and often provides an informed, sardonic take on current events.
A great place to start is this blog post describing the absurdities behind Japan's pro-whaling stance.
Tokyo Reporter
Taking up where the late, great (and now-banned) Tokyo Confidential left off, Tokyo Reporter provides a regular round-up of the sleazy, sensational stories of Japan's tawdry weekly tabloids.

Right to Report campaign image by Committee to Protect Journalists.
Free for reuse.
Global Voices is joining more than 60 other media and press freedom organizations in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists’ campaign for the Right to Report in the Digital Age, targeting the Obama administration.
Revelations about surveillance, intimidation, and exploitation of the press have raised unsettling questions about the rights and safety of journalists’ ability to report in the digital age.
The revelations also give ammunition to governments seeking to tighten restrictions on media and the Internet.
Although the petition is directed at Obama, journalists around the world are affected, both directly and indirectly.
Reports that the NSA and allied spy agencies surveilled journalists-including a report that the NSA hacked Al-Jazeera-create a chilling effect on the press.
Border crossing has long posed a risk for journalists, especially with respect to the search of electronic devices.
Recent revelations about mass surveillance of online platforms in Egypt and the UK, surveillance of journalists in Ethiopia, and harassment of journalists and whistleblowers around the world (often under the auspices of anti-state charges) underscore the fact that the issues raised in the Right to Report campaign are borderless.
From Azerbaijan to Zambia, governments are targeting journalists with communications surveillance and need little excuse to continue doing so.
The NSA spying revelations unquestionably undercut the US government’s legitimacy in arguing to the contrary.
“In Pakistan, where freedom of expression is largely perceived as a Western notion, the Snowden revelations have had a damaging effect,” Sana Saleem, director of the Pakistani digital rights group Bolo Bhi and an author for Global Voices, wrote in a recent blog post for CPJ.
“From the policy landscape to the public narrative regarding free speech and privacy, the Snowden revelations have strengthened the state's argument for surveillance.”
The first stage in the campaign is an open petition.
The campaign seeks three key commitments from the Obama administration: Issue a presidential policy directive prohibiting the hacking and surveillance of journalists and media organizations.
Limit aggressive prosecutions that ensnare journalists and intimidate whistleblowers.
Prevent the harassment of journalists at the U.S. border.
Dozens of leading media outlets from the Associated Press to Huffington Post to Vice News, along with professional journalist associations such as the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and the Society of Professional Journalists, and global and national rights groups like Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and IFEX are all lending their support to the campaign.
Prominent journalists from around the world including Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington, Xiao Qiang and Ahmed Rashid have also signed on to show their support, as well as hundreds of other journalists, bloggers and citizens who recognize that US surveillance and harassment of journalists has an impact beyond national borders.

Efforts in the tiny West African state of the Gambia, which hasn't been affected by the devastating Ebola outbreak, are being intensified to protect the country from the deadly virus.
As of 31 August, nearly 1,900 people in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone have died, according to the World Health Organisation.
Following the confirmation of the first Ebola case in Senegal, the Gambia's immediate neighbour, concerns soared over the country's preparedness and public awareness about the disease.
The confirmation created widespread fear among the Gambians because of the closeness of Senegal to Gambia and porous borders between the two countries.
A coalition of civil society in the Gambia have launched Ebola Free Gambia to try and keep the country Ebola free.
Its Facebook page, created on the 30 August, has over 2,900 likes.
A description of the coalition on its website says:
In light of the proximity of Gambia to the Ebola infected areas, there is a pressing need for immediate action to arrest the possible spread of Ebola into The Gambia by sensitizing the population about the nature of the disease, how it is spread and how to avoid being infected.
The Government of the Gambia from the onset of the outbreak in West Africa has taken some steps to protect our country from Ebola.
The impact of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa already having dire economic consequences to the Gambia not to mention the potential health implications if the disease were to spread into the Gambia.
The campaign complements government's efforts by raising awareness about preparedness, prevention and response using their website, YouTube videos, Facebook and sensitization drives around the country.
Watch one of the campaign's YouTube video below:
Meanwhile, on 11 September the US Embassy in Banjul in collaboration with Gambian artists launched a song dedicated to the crusade against Ebola.
"The Ebola Song" features musicians Tra, Badibunka, Cess Ngum, Killa ACE, & Sandeng, and Amadou Sussocebook.
Listen to it below:
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Banjul has already established a 24-hour information hotline from any network within the country. #EbolaFreeGambia campaign is different from the efforts by the Ministry of Health to sensitize Gambians.
The news of first Ebola case in Senegal prompted Gambian Facebook user Arfang Jobe to suggest that mobile phone companies partner with the Ministry of Health to send text messages to raise awareness about the disease.
Commenting on the suggestion, Hassan Njie cautioned:
The last thing we want is to send fear into the minds of Gambians.
The messages must be tailor made for easy understanding.
People interpret and react to information differently.
Let us be on our guard!
Kb Bojang advised:
I think it will be great too, if they can send voice mails in the different languages we have, to their respective customers with regards to Ebola preventive measures, because I doubt everyone will be able to read the text messages
Mobile phone companies have started sending Ebola related messages to subscribers.
However, It is not clear whether this initiative is the direct result of the Ebola free campaign on social media.
In August, researchers at Oxford University announced that they will begin a trial of a potential vaccine on healthy UK volunteers once ethical approval is granted, which will eventually extend to the Gambia and Mali.
This announcement has since been received with mixed feelings in the Gambia with some being skeptical.
Commenting on the announcement, Mass Bajinka wrote on Facebook:
Why not Liberia, Nigeria and the countries that's already have the virus....why Gambia?????
We don't have single virus their so why Gambia ?
I hope the government say nope.
Eddie Baldeh advised:
The government should say no to this...why The Gambia? a Country that an Ebola has never been reported or diagnose...Do your trials somewhere n leave Gambia alone...in Peace!!
But some are more optimistic and would like the trial to go ahead in the Gambia:
One reason why everyone is worried about this outbreak is because there is no cure.
And now that a prospective vaccine is about to go through trials, here we go again with our conspiracy theories.
Every single drug in the market has a side effect and before they are progressed to clinical trial phase they have to pass safety tests in animals first and the vaccine is deactivated before administering, so it cannot cause disease.
And why Gambia? because vaccines have to be tested on healthy individuals to assess their effectiveness and MRC has years of experience in conducting such studies.
Let's just stop the pessimism people and just be thankful that there is active research being geared towards fighting the deadly disease.
Whatever the case may be, the fact is that many people in the country are worried about the deadly virus entering the country. Follow our in-depth coverage: The Struggle to #StopEbola in West Africa

The fight against the Ebola epidemic is increasingly turning into an international emergency.
The number of victims is growing rapidly in the three most severely affected countries in West Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Patients have also died in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria.
The World Health Organization reports that the most serious epidemic in the history of this hemorrhagic fever has already killed more than 2,800 people out of 5,833 cases as of 20 September.
The United Nations Security Council has adopted Resolution 2177 to deal with the public health crisis.
On 18 September, 131 countries co-sponsored the resolution, which recognizes "the unprecedented extent of the Ebola epidemic in Africa" and describes the creation of a special mission, the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).
US President Barack Obama has announced that he is sending 3,000 American troops to West Africa, in view of the worsening crisis, with the virus spreading exponentially.
Other countries in Africa are concerned about the possibility that the epidemic will spread to them as well, although their health facilities are not ready to deal with it.
A study states that 15 African countries are potentially at risk, due to having the same environmental conditions as the affected countries.
This is the case for Madagascar, where a boat from Liberia suspected of carrying the Ebola virus docked recently in the port of Toamasina.
An emergency meeting was held in Antananarivo on 5 August to look closely at the precautions that need to be taken.
Secretary General of the Madagascar Ministry of Health Philémon Tafangy recognized the risk:
A country such as ours isn't safe from the risks , despite our distance from the affected region
Prime Minister Kolo Roger, however, has stated that the health system is ready to deal with such an eventuality and has a contingency plan in place:
This plan incorporates the scenarios and steps required to tackle epidemics of viral hemorrhagic fevers such as the viral disease Ebola.
Hospital room in Mandritsara, Madagascar - CC BY 2.0
But it appears that the Malagasy health infrastructures will not be able to cope if the disease spreads dramatically.
The PM is choosing to ignore the warnings of scientists, relying instead on airport controls, noting that Madagascar’s public health environment is protected by the lack of flights from the areas affected by the virus.
Scientists point out that the virus can spread in a different way.
Indeed, a recent publication explains how the disease could be spread from the animal kingdom to humans: fruit bats can carry the disease without displaying any signs of it, and are able to migrate and transfer it to other animals, such as monkeys and rodents.
Monkeys are sometimes eaten as bushmeat in Madagascar.
Although consumption of meat may not necessarily cause Ebola, preparation of raw infected meat increases the risk of infection.
Ilaym, an Antananarivo-based blogger for the DailyMg, explains why Malagasy people are specifically vulnerable to an Ebola outbreak.
He lists a few reasons: Some Malagasy people hunt and eat bats and lemurs; and the practice of famadihana, a tradition that consists of exhuming the deceased from their tombs.
Léa Ratsiazo in Antananarivo questioned in a column for newspaper the Madagascar Tribune the country’s real ability to counteract the potential arrival of Ebola in Madagascar, in the light of a recent event in a hospital in the capital:
That takes some believing, because almost at the same time as he was issuing that press statement, a team of foreign surgeons engaging in humanitarian work inadvertenlty contradicted it.
This was a team made up of 11 surgeons, doing humanitarian work across several countries in the world, including Madagascar.
They carry out surgical procedures free of charge for patients that need them in the countries they visit, in partnership with local hospitals.
The HJRA hospital of Antananarivo, which is the largest health care centre in Madagascar, was chosen for this partnership, but the HJRA officials forgot to inform the public of this fact.
As a result, no patients turned up.
They ended up with just two HJRA patients instead of the 25 anticipated daily.
These surgeons were annoyed, stating that they had not come here for a holiday, but to help others, and that the least the hospital should have done was to inform the public and raise awareness.
They were also concerned that patients requiring an operation have to pay for all the drugs and other supplies needed for the procedure.
In addition, it was noted that the HJRA had an acute shortage of basic materials for surgical procedures.
Le Mouvement des Citoyens Malagasy de Paris MCM (The Coalition of Malagasy citizens in Paris) also wonders whom to believe regarding the risk of an Ebola outbreak in Madagascar: the Prime Minister Kolo who says the risks are minimal or the research scientists who included Madagascar in the nations at risk?
So, while a contingency plan exists, it remains to be seen if Madagascar has been able to put in place the resources needed to implement it.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has shared a second gruesome video which allegedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.
Photograaph shared widely on social media
A second video showing the beheading of an American journalist by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a spin-off of Al Qaeda that has come to control one-third of Syria and a quarter of Iraq, has emerged.
The three-minute video allegedly shows the beheading of Steven Sotloff, whose work in hotspots across the Middle East has taken him to Bahrain, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Turkey.
Sotloff disappeared in August last year while reporting in Syria.
This gruesome video follows the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria for 636 days, before a video showing his murder was released by the ISIS on August 19.
Sotloff was identified in the Foley video, with a warning that he would be next.
Now another hostage, David Haines, from the UK, is said to appear in this second video.
DC-based journalist Zaid Benjamin tweets to his 45.5K followers:
The same voice who appeared during the beheading of Foley says David Haines from UK will be next. — Zaid Benjamin (@zaidbenjamin) September 2, 2014
#ISIS says in Steven Sotloff beheading that nations should stay away from any alliance with the US — Zaid Benjamin (@zaidbenjamin) September 2, 2014
According to NBC News, Haines, a former British military, left the military to work for NGOs, where he provides security work.
Shock
The news came as a shock to many.
Kurdish-British blogger Ruwayda Mustafah, with 41K followers on Twitter, is speechless:
#ISIS reportedly beheads Steven Sotloff —What could anyone possibly say?
The strongest of condemnation seems pathetic in the face of #ISIS — Ruwayda Mustafah (@RuwaydaMustafah) September 2, 2014
Emile Hokayem, Mideast analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, explains to his 15K followers on Twitter saying the widespread of such horrific videos showcasing ISIS' crimes desensitize Middle Eastern societies:
Big danger hovering over Middle Eastern societies: desensitization as atrocities multiply, become part of daily 'normalcy.'
RIP Steven — Emile Hokayem (@emile_hokayem) September 2, 2014
He further explains that ISIS is keen on making such videos public as part of its "terror" strategy.
Difference btw ISIS/Assad atrocities not in scale/nature but in publicizing: for ISIS, terror is strategy; Assad needs ambiguity/deniability — Emile Hokayem (@emile_hokayem) September 2, 2014
Colleagues Pay Tribute
On Twitter, many describe Sotloff as a brave journalist.
Photojournalist Mazen Mahdi from Bahrain remarks:
I didn't want to say much earlier about Steven Sotloff but anyone who had worked with him would know he was a fearless reporter ..
RIP — Mazen Mahdi (@MazenMahdi) September 2, 2014
He adds:
Knowing, Steven Sotloff, had the idiots in #isil bothered to check they would have known he was all about real grievances of the people — Mazen Mahdi (@MazenMahdi) September 2, 2014
Journalist Portia Walker laments her loss:
Thinking of you Steven.
A great writer, brave reporter and good friend. — Portia Walker (@portia_walker) September 2, 2014
Lauren Bohn's last encounter with Sotloff was in Cairo.
The multi-media journalist, who is now in Istanbul, recalls:
At a smoky cafe in Cairo, tapping on his keyboard, sharing contacts + smiling widely.
The last time I saw Steven.
A wonderful soul.
RIP. — Lauren Bohn (@LaurenBohn) September 2, 2014
And Global Post journalist Jeb Boone met Sofloff in Yemen.
He remembers how people were confused between them:
I met Steven in Yemen.
People thought we were the same person because we were both fat and white.
Pretty funny.
RIP dude. — Jeb Boone (@JebBoone) September 2, 2014
#ISISmediaBlackout
Just like with the Foley video, many are calling for an ISIS media blackout.
Instead of sharing the ISIS beheading video, they are calling for remembering Sotloff in better times.
Among them is Zach Green, who says:
Don't share #ISIS's beheading video, that's what they want. #ISISmediaBlackout RIP Steven Sotloff. pic.twitter.com/c3gDLTbBar — Zach Green (@140elect) September 2, 2014
This tweet has been shared about 800 times at the time of writing this post.
From Libya, Ismael lends his support:
Can't believe this bears repeating but one should not empower ISIS by publishing their PR materials.
RIP Steven Sotloff. — Jeb Boone (@JebBoone) September 2, 2014
And from Lebanon, Elie Fares explains:
Don’t give them what they want: ears to listen & eyes to fear their brutality. #ISISMediaBlackout pic.twitter.com/9H7Zf9q6dQ — Elie Fares (@eliefares) September 2, 2014

Melody Sundberg analyses freedom of expression in Ethiopia after detained Ethiopian bloggers spent 100 days in prison:
Ethiopia is with its almost 94 million population the second most populated country in Africa.
Nevertheless, it does not according to an interview with Endalkhachew Chala by Global Voices, have an independent daily newspaper or independent media.
There was a need of an alternative voice and the Zone 9:ers therefore began blogging and using social media to write on subjects related to human rights.
The name of the group, Zone 9, refers to the zones of the notorious Ethiopian Kality prison, where political prisoners and journalists are being held.
The prison has eight zones, but the ninth "zone" refers to the rest of Ethiopia.
Even if being outside of the prison walls - you are never truly free; any freethinking individual may be arrested.
The bloggers wanted to be the voice of this ninth zone.
In the interview, Endalkachew says that the group had campaigns about respecting the constitution, stopping censorship and respecting the right to demonstrate.
The group also visited political prisoners, such as journalists Eskinder Nega and Reeyot Alemu.
They wanted to bring the publics' attention to them by using social media.

By Sami Shah
Oh Muslims, you so crazy.
But just how crazy?
That's the question everyone has these days.
As ISIS/ISIL/IS/FuckNutBuggerFucks continue their march across Iraq/Levant/Babylonia/Assyria, and enthusiastic nut-jobs around the world get inspired by YouTube calls-to-arms and begin cutting heads off on a freelance basis, things are going to get bad for the average Muslim.
Sami Shah.
Used with permission.
But Sami, I hear you ask, what is an "average Muslim"?
Is the guy in a balaclava carrying a Kalashnikov and a bag full of heads an "average Muslim"?
Or is it the sweet man who lives next door to me, with three kids and a friendly wife?
How do we identify them?
Classify them?
Defeat them in battle?
Prevent them from forming into a single, mega Kaiju-Muslim?
I can't provide all the answers, but I can help with some of your queries.
So, without further ado (and with much blatant and shameless self-promotion), let me present an excerpt from my book I, MIGRANT, which answers all your questions.
The Types of Muslims
(works best if read in British Broadcaster David Attenborough voice)
Good Muslim:
My parents are the perfect living example of this type of believer.
They believe fervently in Allah, the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad.
Both pray five times a day, give to the poor, have performed Hajj and end all praise with the grateful invocations of Allah’s grace.
Both my mother and father know certain passages of the Quran by heart, especially those that aid in searching for lost everyday items, and generally find pride in being a Muslim.
Mommy doesn't wear a hijab and Daddy doesn’t have a beard.
Nor do they think that the West was created by Satan and should be defeated in battle by inflicting maximum civilian casualties through random and creative acts of murderous suicide.
They do, however, think that America hates Muslims, that its support of Israel is evidence of this, further proven by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
These are their opinions and, by and large, are no more toxic or damaging to the environment than my mother’s belief that all men are inherently lazy and my father’s belief that all women give terrible advice.
Chances are, if you were to randomly pick one hundred Muslims from around the world, they would all be like my parents.
Islam is a part of their life, but it doesn't get in the way.
Bad Muslim:
Judged unfavourably by all other forms of Muslims, these are the second most common kind.
They are Muslims by birth and by name.
They may even go so far as to appreciate the sanctity of the Quran, Allah and his Prophet, but it ends there.
They have no patience for actually practising rituals and in general will be reluctant even to publicly identify themselves as Muslim.
Some of them drink, despite the prohibitions.
But none of them will ever eat pork.
Pork is the final frontier for the Muslim.
Sure, they may lustily eye a strip of bacon if they ever encounter one, maybe even pause to consider a side of ribs after seeing it on a television show, but on average the safest place for a pig is in a Muslim country.
For alcohol though, there are all kinds of ready justifications provided.
"The Quran only outlaws a specific type of booze," they may say, pointing to the literal prohibition against wine made from fermented dates.
Or "Islam is all about moderation," they may argue, just before passing out in a puddle of vodka and vomit.
In a Venn diagram of the beliefs shared between Good and Bad Muslims, the only overlap would be that they too think that America hates Muslims, that its support of Israel is evidence of this, further proven by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
Terrible Muslim:
Currently occupying every possible government job in any Muslim country you survey, another name for this breed of Muslim is "Hypocritical Bastards".
They are different from the Bad Muslims in that, while they may commit every sin and indulge every prohibition, they present themselves as symbols of Islamic virtue.
You can usually recognize them by the aggressively overt way they express their love for Islam.
The men will have long, pious beards, with which they demonstrate both their commitment and masculinity; they have permanently bruised foreheads, to provide evidence of a lifetime spent prostrating on a prayer mat.
Their women will wear the hijab—not wrapped tight, as is custom, but instead floating several inches above an immense hairstyle that defies both the laws of physics and style.
They will always have in their hands a string of prayer beads on an endless rotation through ceaseless fingers.
Every prayer is read by both genders and every Hajj attended.
Their commitment to the charade may even go so far as to shun alcohol and be completely loving and devoted husbands/wives.
But put a rupee in front of them and they will serve up a round of bacon and ham while marrying a Kafir and swearing an oath to Satan.
They can also be counted in the club of people who believe that America hates Muslims, that its support of Israel is evidence of this, further proven by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
The only difference here is that most of them tend to be quite willing to cozy up to their enemy if the price is right.
Actually, that's not true.
It's not if the price is right—it's if there is any price at all.
Frightening Muslim:
Tends to talk about "Jihad" a lot.
Your average mosque imam is a good example.
In appearances not that different from the "Terrible Muslim", only with a greater commitment to the lifestyle.
The men will not just sport beards, but have shaved upper lips as well.
This stylish look is rooted in the belief that the Prophet wore his beard in the same way, although there is no actual evidence to prove this.
Nor is there any to prove that his pyjamas ended several inches above his ankles, but that is also a popular sartorial choice amongst this lot.
Now I should also provide some clarification about my introduction to this class of Muslim.
The Frightening Muslim may say "jihad" a lot and talk about fighting the West and how the Muslim Ummah needs to rise up in revolt, but chances are you will never find one anywhere near a front line.
They are classified as Frightening, by the way, only by westerners who see the stuff of terroristic nightmares in their appearance.
For their fellow Muslims, this kind tends to be annoying at most and ridiculous at best.
We tolerate them because on average they are useful in teaching your children the Quran (as long as you strictly supervise that the education is limited to Arabic rote memorization and does not include any kind of opinion-forming rhetoric or casual molestation).
Their opinions range from far-fetched conspiracies—in which Islamic sects other than the one they belong to are plotting their downfall—to the belief that America hates Muslims, that its support of Israel is evidence of this, further proven by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
An example of the Frightening Muslim is the entire country of Saudi Arabia.
Downright Crazy Muslim:
They believe that America hates Muslims, that its support of Israel is evidence of this, further proven by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
The only difference is, they want to do something about it.
And that something includes killing Westerners, killing active supporters of the West, killing passive supporters of the West, killing anyone who is in the way of getting to the actives, passives and westerners and finally just killing everyone.
Examples of the Downright Crazy Muslim are Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al Zwahiri, all of Al Qaeda, the Taliban.

"No to sex tourist".
Screenshot from video posted on YouTube.
By mid July 2014, the Facebook page No to sex tourist was created, with the purpose of create awareness about sex tourism in Colombia.
Wikipedia lo define como:
Sex tourism is travel to engage in sexual activity, particularly with prostitutes.
The World Tourism Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, defines sex tourism as "trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination".
"When will Ebola news go 24/7?," asks a US/Canadian professor Crawford Kilian:
I have long been used to outbreak news dropping off on weekends.
The media, government agencies, and NGOs all knock off on Friday afternoon and show up again Monday morning.
But after the last few weeks of Ebola, I'm losing patience with the folks who make a living covering the outbreak.
Yes, good for them and the collective agreements that give them eight-hour days, weekends off, extended holidays, and excellent health benefits.
But if Ebola is as unprecedented as Dr. Chan says it is, how about finding the money to pay those folks overtime so Ebola news carries on over the weekend (not to mention statutory holidays)?
Can you imagine news about Pearl Harbor waiting until some reporter sauntered in on the morning of Monday, December 8, 1941?
Or JFK's death going unreported until the following Monday, November 25, 1963?
But the West African media, with a few exceptions, go into hibernation on Friday afternoons and revive sometime the following Monday.
So do WHO and the other major health agencies.

Protesters in Hong Kong are using umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas.
Photo from Twitter @15MBcn_int
Protesters demanding genuine democratic elections in Hong Kong were met with batons, tear gas and pepper spray during the second day of demonstrations in the city.
Following clashes between Hong Kong police and student protesters on September 27, pro-democracy group Occupy Central with Love and Peace kickstarted a massive sit-in at 1:30 a.m. the following day to pressure China's government into withdrawing its requirement that candidates for Hong Kong's top leader get majority support from a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee.
Riot police began attempting to disperse protesters wielding batons and deploying tear gas and pepper spray beginning at 6 p.m. on September 28.
Thousands of protesters were still in streets near the city's financial center confronting riot police by the time this article was published.
Unverified accounts of police using rubber bullets to shoot at protesters have circulated on social media.
Key protest organizers have urged protesters to retreat at around 10 p.m.
China has promised special administrative region Hong Kong, which enjoys certain autonomy from the mainland, a direct vote in the 2017 chief executive election, but pro-democracy activists maintain the nominating committee undermines the people's right to choose their leader.
Hong Kong police called the sit-in illegal and blocked roads and pathways leading to the government headquarters.
More and more people arrived and scattered around Admiralty and Central districts as they attempted to reach the government headquarters by walking pass the Harcourt and Connaught Highway.
Eventually the two main roads at the center of the financial district were blocked at around 3 p.m.
Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying held a press conference at 3:30 p.m. repeating his stand that election reform in Hong Kong has to be restricted by the framework set by Beijing and that the police would take action against illegal protests, in accordance with the law.
Thousands of protesters were surrounding the government headquarters at various spots in Admiralty and Central districts, blocking several roads.
Police raised an orange-colored warning sign, stating "disperse or we fire":

In addition, the police instructed the metro company to shut down the Admiralty station in order to deploy more riot police to back up the crackdown.
But protesters set up a barricade at the entrance of the subway to block police:

On September 5, the U.S. Department of Justice issued to the organization and Web hosting provider May First an inquiry about one of its members, Greece-based Center for Independent Media Athens, also known as Indymedia Athens.
Founded in 2005, May First is a non-profit organization dedicated to provide cooperative Internet services, such as Web hosting to individuals and organizations.
The data required by federal agents is specific information from the Indymedia Athens account, stored on May First servers.
In a statement, May First noted that the request could be interpreted as an attempt by the American government to help the Greek government.
For now, lawyers with Electronic Frontier Foundation, who are representing May First, are in touch with the U.S. Attorney General.
Upon publication of this piece, US officials had offered no explanation of their motives in requesting said data.
There are millions of them.
They live scattered across our continent, Europe.
They are all categorised as immigrants.
Despite this, none of them have the same story. Each one is different from the other.
Therefore, if we wanted to tell everyone's life story, it would take thousands of books.
However, there is an online project that helps to establish contact with these people who are generically labelled as migrants.
It helps to overcome prejudices and stereotypes and improve people's knowledge about them.
Surprising Europe belongs to them, an open book, written by many people and supported by pictures and videos.
Personal stories, successes, failures and hopes are "written" on this platform.
It is the immigrants who tell their story in first person.
It is surprising when you find out how much strength is necessary to overcome language barriers, bureaucracy, and relationships.
It is surprising when you find out how many would like to go home and cannot.
Many go back and tell their friends: it is better if we build our future here, in our land.
It is surprising when this message is sent: better poor but free.
It is surprising when you find out that even in Europe there are poor people and when someone admits that the old continent is not the paradise they dreamed of.
And it is surprising when, on the contrary, someone sees their dream come true, those who succeed through music, those who build a career in a factory, those who study and set up a freelance profession.
In this open space, the words are not abridged and experiences find a way of becoming a common, shared heritage.
This site highlights lives on the margins of society, but also successes.
You have to enter without preconceptions, without imagining what you will find, as when meeting friends, where one topic leads to another.
The idea—a non-profit project—aims to document the experiences of legal but also illegal migration.
It was created by Witfilm Amsterdam and Ssuuna Goloob, who arrived in Europe from Uganda to see with his own eyes if what he had heard about our countries and how we live here was true.
A project that many believe in, judging by the sponsors: from Al Jazeera, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, to the International Organisation for Migration and the European Union Fund for repatriation.
It is no coincidence that the idea was born in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, as it is regarded as one of the cities with the largest number of nationalities present: 176 out of a total of 811,000 inhabitants (the metropolitan area on the other hand has a population of 1.6 million inhabitants).
The website is divided into six categories: Leaving for Europe, Life in Europe, Short on luck, Getting down to work, Going back, Music.
A project within the project is some television series.
Each one different but related by some themes.
Stories of desperation, but also stories that are a source of inspiration, hope and creativity.
The dark side and the triumphant side.
The fight, sometimes defeat, often success.
The protagonists themselves worked on the television series, which has already been broadcast on Al Jazeera and on Dutch public television.
In this case as well they try to avoid filters, interpretations and judgments.
The project also has a hymn, "Surprising Europe".
It is sung by Annie, who was born in Italy, with Liberian origins.
And it is to Liberia that she would like to return.
To get to know her land and maybe live there.
Annie is now part of a "mixed" Afro band, Pepe Soup.
They want to convey a message to the world: UNITE!
Surprising Europe belongs to them, the immigrants, but it also belongs to anyone who wants to better understand and get to know these immigrants.
And to go a little deeper into their lives.
Protest March in UK demanding to eradicate the centuries-old caste system that exists on the Indian sub continent and amongst expatriate communities.

Karthik Shashidhar, a freelance management consultant and data scientist, shares interesting statistics from the National Family Health Survey.
Shashidhar discusses the percentage of women in India who are married to someone of their own caste. The caste system in India is based on an order of (predominantly) endogamous groups rendering marriage out of caste deplored by the society.
Most of the marriage out of caste is out of love and defying the socio-cultural norms.
The survey, which was carried out in all states in India, asked “ever-married” women whether they were married to someone from the same caste, or to someone from a higher caste, or to someone from a lower caste.
The result shows that the national average for the percentage of women who are married to someone of their own caste is 89%.

The body of a victim of Ebola virus is seen covered with a sheet at the back of a truck in Monrovia, Liberia -Public Domain
The Press Union of Liberia is concerned about the threat to freedom of information as a result of the actions taken by the government to limit the expansion of the Ebola virus.
The union wrote a letter to the Minister of Justice to draw his attention to the challenges media workers are currently facing.
Here is an excerpt of the letter:
The Press Union of Liberia’s attention is specifically drawn to several circumstances that do not only restrain journalists in their obligation to seek out and share useful news and information with the public, but significantly threaten even media participation in the global fight against Ebola.
By all accounts, the media space in Liberia has been a significant partner in the fight to strengthen awareness in our society about the impact and challenges of the epidemic.
Notwithstanding the loss of revenue due to the emergency nature of the epidemic and the effect on general life, the media has remained committed to this fight.
Unfortunately, several actions against media by government actors, especially during these times, have simply given room to growing skepticism about the disease, and further exacerbating the denials within the community. We think this is unfair and improper.

As the UN launchs its peace keeping mission with the arrival of 1,500 troops in the Central African Republic (CAR), a few observers were wondering why it took so long given the extent of the casualties.
Les Cercles nationaux de Réflexion sur la Jeunesse (CNRJ) is an NGO in Bangui, CAR that strives to build the foundation for sustainable peace in the country in partnership with the University of Bangui.
Here is a video that illustrates the work in process :
On September 19, 1985, the center, South and West regions of Mexico, in particular the Federal District, were struck by a powerful earthquake, considered the most lethal in Mexican written history.
Conmemorating the event 29 year later, the Secretary for Civil Protection of Federal District organized an earthquake drill, for the population to know how to act in these events.
The people participated massively, in the capital and in other cities of the country.
We carried out successfully the evacuation due to earthquake, remembering what happened in 1985 in Mexico City.
An estimated of 17,000 buildings were evacuated during the drill.
Rolando Zapata's Yucatán government has carried out historic drill in the Palace.
Tlalnepantla joins the megaearthquake driill organized in the State of Mexico.
The drill is not only to honor the victims of the earthquake, it's also about society vs bureaucracy.

Good news from war-torn Syria is rare these days.
Just last week, the United Nations revised its death toll for the bloody conflict between forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad and the factions that are opposed to his rule to more than 191,000.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay lamented that there is “no end in sight.”
With the situation so grim, let’s revisit one of those rare uplifting moments to come out of Syria in the last year.
To those who don't believe in miracles, here is one.
Ghina is alive again after she was pulled from under the rubble.
The warplanes shell the buildings, but human beings and children are the victims.
Ghina lost her mother when they were buried under the rubble due to shelling.
Ghina was lucky, but her mother wasn't.
Now Ghina lives with her father and six siblings in their displaced house that lacks the minimum necessities of life.
Ghina is one of thousands of Syrian children who are paying a heavy price in the civil war, now in its third year.
More than 191,000 people have died in the bloody conflict for control of Syria between forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad and the factions that are opposed to his rule, who first rose up during the wave of Arab Spring demonstrations across the region.
Ghina was a victim of the crude barrel bombs that the government has dropped on civilian areas despite international condemnation.

One person has been confirmed dead, nearly fifty climbers are severely injured, and ten people are missing after Mount Ontake (御嶽山, Ontake-san), a popular climbing spot in central Japan, erupted for the first time in five years.
News coverage shows billowing clouds of ash, and a large climbing lodge at the top of the mountain covered in grey cinder.
Search for Ontake on Twitter to keep updated on this developing story.
Massive eruption on Mount Ontake
AP was able to get pictures of terrified hikers hurrying down the mountain.
At 3,067 m, Mount Ontake is the second-tallest volcano in Japan after Mount Fuji.
It's located in Gifu, close to the large city of Nagoya in central Japan, and is a popular hiking destination in summer and early fall.
Due to the many missing and wounded, many people are looking for updates on the status and whereabouts of friends and loved ones caught on the mountain during the eruption.
One popular Tweet sketches out a rough map of the pyroclastic flow: I spent a nice day by myself hiking to the top of Mount Ontake
As of yet, her whereabouts are unknown.
Update Rescue efforts are ongoing to recover climbers trapped at the top of the mountain, which continues to erupt.
A still from Toni Zen's video clip "Under Control."
Toni Zen was once, not so long ago, Macedonia's biggest hip hop star, a media darling whose every move was followed.
Since releasing a song about freedom of speech, however, Zen seems to have been dropped by Macedonian media.
...Media pressure
bombardment with commercials
this is how you do it
"Do not think on your own!"
Freedom of speech
closed in a shaft
as justice
goes down the drain
They made us quarrel and fight among ourselves
they changed us from the root
and have fun regarding our misery
while building their empire...
...I know the things
are not as they say
this is not us
they keep us under control
It is known
Everything is under control...
Zen's song and the ambitious, well-executed video directly refer to the stifling of freedom of speech and social disparity in Macedonia, with audio and visual references to works by American comedian George Carlin and British author George Orwell.
The music video received critical acclaim and was selected the best video of 2013 by the jury of popular annual manifestation Zlatna Buba Mara.
Very few people have been able to see, however, as it has been completely absent from mainstream Macedonian media.
The artist's performing career has also come to a near stop and he now rarely appears at public events.
Protesters use umbrellas to shield themselves tear gas.
Photo taken by PH Yang.
Can an umbrella be used as a tool to fight for democracy?
Absolutely.
In Hong Kong, peaceful demonstrators demanding genuine democratic elections are using umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray and tear gas and to to keep them from getting wet if the police deploys water cannons.
A striking image taken during the massive sit-in near government headquarters on September 28 showed crowds upon crowds of protesters holding umbrellas in a variety of colors, contrasting sharply with the police's riot gear.
Carol Chan designed the poster for the "umbrella movement" in Hong Kong.
It said "Taiwan has sun flower movement, Hong Kong has sunshade movement".
Foreign media have dubbed the peaceful protest the "umbrella revolution".
The Facebook group "Hong Kong Democracy Now" rectified the title to "Umbrella Movement" and wrote a explanatory note on it:
Foreign media has titled this movement the "Umbrella Revolution."
This is hardly a revolution.
"Umbrella Movement" is a more suitable title in this context.
The only "weapons" we have, at most, are the umbrellas we always carry in our bags for the unpredictable weather.
Hongkongers wish for nothing but stability.
However, as much as we cannot see through the cloudy skies, we do not wish to be stormed upon.
"Umbrella Movement" represents a mellow but determined campaign: In the face of gale and storm, we will never back down!
The sit-in, called Occupy Central, demands that Beijing withdraw the framework it has imposed on the election of Hong Kong's top leader, called the chief executive, which requires those who want to run for the office to get majority support from a nominating committee stacked with pro-Beijing (and therefore pro-Chinese Communist Party) members.
The sit-in protests spread from the financial district in Admiralty to the commercial district in Causeway Bay and Mongkok.
Traffic in Hong Kong Island has remained paralyzed throughout the day of September 29.
Beijing mouthpiece Global Times ran an opinion piece on Occupy Central, which began on September 28, accusing the movement of ruining Hong Kong's image.
Are umbrellas really more damaging to the city's image than armed police holding huge tear gas cannons?

Someone sure wanted people to know that he was thankful for Togolese President Faure Gnassingbé generosity.
This week, a giant billboard was raised in Lomé, Togo that praised the president's action in favor of providing lunch for school children.
Togolese citizens were taken aback by the message and its exuberance.
They took to twitter to poke fun at the Billboard and create the hashtag #merciPapaFaure (Thank you Daddy Faure).
OK, how about some fun with the hashtag #mercipapaFaure ?
The photo above has been shared widely on twitter.
Adzima provides some background on the state of the affair for the Togolese children at school.
Flooding in Niamey in Niger - Public Domain
Heavy rains and flooding in Niger have killed 12 people and left thousands without homes.
Rivers in Niamey and the extended regions have risen and destroyed thousands of houses.
In the region, land degradation and cultivation of marginal land increase the risk that extreme events can develop into natural disasters.
Some solutions for flood preparedness were being implemented by national authorities :
ANADIA Niger aims to develop methodologies and tools to assess flood risk, to support planning at different decision making levels, to increase the resilience of local communities and to develop a greater capacity for forecasting and response.
In this context, the development of a floods database will contribute to a more effective decision-making.
Up until a few weeks ago, Maryam Al Khawajah and Alaa Abd El Fattah were on hunger strike and in jail.
Hashtags demanding their release from prison in Bahrain and Egypt were trending on Twitter.
These prominent activists join us on this episode of GV Face from the freedom of their homes, but their struggle is far from over.
Maryam is currently in Copenhagen, unable to see her father, a leading Bahrain activist who has been behind bars and on hunger strike twice since 2011.
In Egypt, Alaa was released on bail shortly after he ended his 40 days hunger strike in jail a few weeks ago.
He is currently awaiting a re-trial and is under a travel ban.
His 20-year-old younger sister is on her 47th day of hunger strike behind bars. Hundreds of political prisoners are currently on hunger strike in Egypt and Bahrain.
Maryam and Alaa have been tweeting their day-by-day struggles the last three years, ever since the 'Arab Spring' captured the imagination of hundreds of thousands around the world.
Alaa has more than 636 K Twitter followers and Maryam has close to 101K followers on the microblogging site.
In Egypt, some hunger strikers have been in jail since anti-regime protests broke out on January 25, 2011.
In Bahrain, which has been witnessing anti-regime protests since February 14, 2011, more than 600 political prisoners have gone on hunger strike to protest torture in jail.
In this episode we talk to Alaa and Maryam about their activism, the struggles they face in Bahrain and Egypt and the hopes that keeps them resilient about their country's future.
Alaa has been jailed or investigated under every Egyptian head of state who has served during his lifetime.
In 2006, he was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest.
In 2011, he spent two months in prison, missing the birth of his first child.
In 2013, he was arrested and detained for 115 days without trial.
And he now he faces 15 years in prison.
Maryam was arrested at the airport in late August, as she tried to enter Bahrain to meet her father a prominent human rights activist who has been behind bars since April 2011.
Her father was on the 27th day of his second hunger strike.
More than 600 political prisoners have gone on hunger strike in Bahrain to protest being tortured in prison, since February 14, 2011, when anti-regime protests started.
Maryam is the co-director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights
The Al Khawaja family has found itself at the forefront of protests in Bahrain, ever since the so-called Arab Spring made its way to the tiny island- kingdom on February 14, 2011.
Prominent human rights activist Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja is currently in prison, serving a life sentence for his role in the protests.
Turning to social media, his daughters Maryam, aged 27, and Zainab Al Khawaja, aged 31, became vocal on Twitter, sharing their story and what was happening in their country to thousands of followers across the world.
With 102K and 48.8K followers on Twitter respectively, Maryam and Zainab have been constantly badgered by the authorities for speaking up.
Zainab is currently in prison for tearing up the King's photograph in court.
Maryam had to leave Bahrain after being detained at the airport when she tried to visit her father.
After Maryam was arrested at the airport, she was accused of hitting a member of the police force.
Maryam denies the charges.
In detention, she started a hunger strike.
She was released from jail on September 19 and has since left the country.
Her father remains in prison.
Maryam is the co-director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights.
In this episode of GV Face, we speak to Maryam Al Khawaja.
Bahrain is now in the third year of its crackdown on a popular uprising.
International media reports the protests in Bahrain as a Shia-led revolution against a Sunni regime.
While many may see that there is nothing wrong with this description, it is simplistic and doesn’t capture what is happening on the ground.
It fails to acknowledge that Bahrainis who rose against the regime did not do so because they were Shia and the regime was Sunni.
We talk to Maryam Al Khawaja about the role sectarianism plays in Bahrain and how that affects the movement.
Who is the victim and who is the perpetrator of sectarianism?
How does systematic sectarian oppression work in Bahrain?
And why is the Bahrain uprising tainted as sectarian?
GV Face: To Vote or Not to Vote?
These general elections are the first under Tunisia's new constitution and the second since the 2011 uprisings that overthrew Ben Ali.
Tunisia served as the spark for the Arab Spring that rippled across the MENA region in 2011.
Uprisings in other countries have led to political stalemates, military takeovers or continued violence, but things have been different in Tunisia.
More than 9000 candidates from over a 100 parties are contesting in this election, and for the first time in the country's modern history, Tunisians cannot predict which parties will win.
Some Tunisians have made the deliberate choice of not voting, while others have decided to concentrate their votes on a few political forces and alliances that are deemed capable of amassing a majority of ballots.
In this episode of GV Face, our video hangout series, GV's MENA editor Amira talks to GV author Ahmed Medien and election observer Emir Sfaxi.
We talk to them about their hopes and expectations, the process of the elections and the changes that these elections might bring in the 5 next years.

A Just Sentence?
Too Lenient?
Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius in court.
May 5, 2014 by Ihsaan Haffejee.
Oscar Pistorius, the South African double-leg amputee runner who was found guilty of culpable homicide (manslaughter) after shooting his girlfriend last year, has been sentenced to five years in prison.
He also received a suspended sentence of three years for a firearm offence.
Pistorius says he thought Reeva Steenkamp was an intruder trying to break into the house through the bathroom window.
The state, according to Judge Thokozile Masipa, failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius intended to kill her.
The trial, the biggest social media event in South Africa, generated huge global interest and intense media scrutiny.
His conviction came on the heels of a 77-year sentence handed down to a rhino poacher in July, shocking and angering many Twitter users.
Others thought the judge was too lenient, a clear indication of a broken justice system in South Africa:
Utterly pathetic verdict.
Makes a mockery of human life to be sentenced to less for killing than for fraud.
#oscarpistorius 5 years?
He could be out in 2 years -NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!! — Dame Jana Hitchens-M (@offlinesometime) October 21, 2014
Under South African law, he will be eligible for release after 8 months.
Stefanie Ship asked:
What is wrong with this world in that you kill someone & only get 5 years imprisonment?!
Is somebody only worth 5 years?! #OscarPistorius — Stefanie Ship (@stefanieshipman) October 21, 2014
Remember - 5 year sentence means he could be free after not much more than 2 years. #OscarPistorius — andrew harding (@BBCAndrewH) October 21, 2014

you are a disgrace #Masipa NO JUSTICE 4Steenkamps & a travesty to womens' rights /domestic abuse (which you deny in yr sentence)#OscarTrial — Ms Marwood Black (@Marwood20) October 21, 2014
I know it was not about satisfying the society, but I would have liked the years to be 10 at least! #OscarPistorius #OscarTrial — Sibusiso Mgidi (@SibusisoMgidi1) October 21, 2014
The trial was longer than how long Oscar will spend in jail. #OscarTrial — Prince Akeem (@tackyz) October 21, 2014
On Facebook, Thapelo Tips Seemise compared the sentence to the time that has passed since Steenkamp's killing:
It took 2years to get to a conclusion of 5years imprisonment!!!
Justice is a myth in our country ‪#‎OscarTrial‬
Others, however, were in favour of the sentence:
@ChrisWragge Agreed.
Still, 5 yrs is better than community service, which is where the Judge seemed headed. #OscarPistorius @CBSNewYork — KK Smith (@sassy_kk) October 21, 2014
So many people to quick to judge Oscar as if they're perfect, he got prison time so be happy and stop complaining. #OscarTrial — Nqobile (@Iam_nqobs) October 21, 2014
Regardless of what we think Judge Masipa really understands the purpose of #Judgment, its for #Reconciliation not #Condemnation #OscarTrial — Prosper Ntuli (@Proetic) October 21, 2014
Not everyone will agree w/ sentence. Light.
But #JudgeMasipa had well reasoned argument reaching sentence. #OscarSentence #OscarTrial. — Thebe Ikalafeng (@ThebeIkalafeng) October 21, 2014
People mustn't make conclusions here and insult and act pathetic towards our Law.
Some reacted with a sense of humor:
I expect a book trilogy release 'How To Get Away With Murder' #OscarPistorius — Jess Espin (@JessEspinX) October 21, 2014

Palestinians in Gaza celebrate Eid Al Adha under the hashtags #GazaEid and #غزة_بدها_تعيد (meaning, Gaza wants to celebrate Eid).
This photograph shared by the Palestinian Information Center shows children in a busy shopping street marketing the hashtag yesterday
With over 2,000 Palestinian deaths in the latest Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip, citizens still find reasons to commemorate the Islamic Eid Al-Adha, which begins across the Muslim world today.
Eid Al Adha or the Festival of Sacrifice culminates the Hajj season, which this year attracted 2 million pilgrims from around the world.
In Gaza, there is hope amidst rubble, destruction, and loss.
Twitter users began circulating images of crowded streets and markets, and shared positive messages using the hashtags #GazaEid and #غزة_بدها_تعيد (meaning, Gaza wants to celebrate Eid).
The 50-day offensive, which killed at least 2,137 Palestinians, a majority of whom were civilians, including 577 children, and wounded at least 10,870 others, may have destroyed the Strip's infrastructure but has failed to dent the morale of civilians, who shake off the rubble today to celebrate Eid.
The attack has had a noticeable effect on Gaza's economy, with hardly any civilian infrastructure left untouched: over 18,000 homes destroyed, as well as over 100 schools, 50 health-care centers and 17 hospitals damaged or 20 destroyed.
Twitter user Sana'a Mohammed shares an image of a young boy playing in a demolished playground:
And of course, Eid's spirit is always intensified by traditional, homemade ma'moul (date cookies):
Children, despite pain, will enjoy Eid, says Hiba in Gaza:
Despite the pain, the children of Gaza will commemorate Eid
More from Gaza's markets, where the spirits seem to be at a high:
Gaza wants to celebrate Eid
Nuseiba points out that despite the many sacrifices and losses Gaza endured those last few months, the city still wants to celebrate Eid:
This year the Feast of Sacrifice came early to Gaza, which sacrificed its children and property. Despite all this, Gaza wants to celebrate Eid
Farah joins Nuseiba, and the hundreds of other Twitter users when noting how just last Eid, Gaza was still under attack:
Indeed they do:

Zambia's National Freedom Day last year in Lusaka.
October 24, 2013, photo by Owen Miyanza.
Demotix.
Zambia celebrated its golden jubilee last week, on October 24.
This year's anniversary marked the first time in 50 years of independence that Zambia's sitting head of state was absent at the festivities, as President Michael Sata was abroad for what his staff called a “medical check up.”
While Zambians all over the world celebrated the holiday with food, the national colours, and anything else they could lay their hands on, some observations have raised serious questions about the country's past and future.
Zambia's official golden jubilee logo.
The most high-profile criticism came from the opposition: United Party for National Development (UPND) leader Hakainde Hichilema called on people to wear black to commemorate and not celebrate the occasion:
What did the freedom fighters envisage this country will be 50 years down the road?
Is it what it is today?
Since the PF came to power on a platform of lies and deceit the country has witnessed repression, the country has witnessed violation of fundamental human rights, freedoms and liberties, bias public media coverage, police brutality, political violence of unprecedented levels I never thought I would live post 1991 to see a country that has so much political violence.
Some Zambian social media users didn't agree with Hichilema, who spent the day comforting the bereaved and distributing bags of corn meal and cooking oil, but it was Canicius Banda, one of UPND's two vice presidents, who attracted the most attention on Zambia's golden jubilee with a question posed on Facebook.
Banda challenged the public to think harder about the holiday, asking if independence day celebrates the mere passage of time, or the country's achievements since that hot summer night 50 years ago, when Northern Rhodesia transformed itself into the Republic of Zambia.
He wrote:
ON ZAMBIA'S GOLDEN JUBILEE : Vernon Mwaanga, one of Zambia's own freedom fighters and political authorities, in his book, The Long Sunset, observes as follows: '...the colonialists left more than 40 years ago and in the case of many African countries we can no longer blame them for our woes.
Slavery belongs to our painful past.
Now we must transform our countries and move towards modernity, correcting our past mistakes, but moving forward all the time...' The Republican Vice President Dr Guy Scott, fifty years post-independence, only one week ago, commenting on the 2015 National Budget said this: 'Our priorities as a nation are wrong.
Instead of fighting unemployment we are focusing on single-digit inflation; meanwhile citizens in the Lukanga swamps are surviving on scorpions.
This is not right.'
Mr Alexander Chikwanda, Minister of Finance, a few weeks ago stated as follows: 'We have failed to progress in this country because of leadership failure.'
Mr Chikwanda is spot on with his diagnosis.
As we start another 50 years, we need a new breed of youthful, patriotic, nationalistic, knowledgeable, wise and God-fearing leaders.
This is our prayer.
Lord hear us!
And we are sure that He will answer our prayer.
These 'Belinda Times', times of deception must surely end!
Michael Chishala, in a contribution to the online news website Zambian Watchdog, wrote:
After 50 years of self-rule, it is shameful that our economic statistics are equivalent to war-torn countries, some of which are now doing better than us in many areas.
Every Zambian government has blamed something other than themselves for the mess we are in.
They are elected to bring change but they fail, while we the citizens are not putting enough pressure on them.
It is time we the new generation make a change.
Chishala then posed some ways forward for Zambia:
I believe there has to be a change of ideas and attitudes.
Zambians should firstly realize that they should take their vote seriously and not be swept off their feet by smooth talking politicians.
They should adopt a skeptical disposition and thoroughly question prospective candidates ... Civil Society, the Church, political parties and all of us must press for a drastic reduction in the powers of the Executive, arguably the greatest single problem.
In a joint pastoral letter on Independence Day Eve, Zambia's three "mother" body churches—the Zambia Episcopal Conference, Christian Council of Zambia, and Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia—stressed the need for poverty reduction as a top priority:
The challenge though still remains for Zambia to put in place better redistributive policies so that the majority poor and the most vulnerable in our society are not left to be mere spectators in the current economic activities.
In other words, the country’s economic boom would only be meaningful if it significantly reduces poverty among the people of Zambia and allows the active participation of the majority citizenry.
Unfortunately, what we see being achieved is the ever widening gap between the rich and the poor and marginalization of rural areas in terms of infrastructure development and economic activities.

The Ebola epidemic is raging, causing hysteria worldwide.
The people of West Africa, where the epidemic began, are under surveillance by international health authorities.
Guinée, which was already in the throes of severe socioeconomic problems before the virus' outbreak, has suffered the brunt of the epidemic.
Guinée's population, however, is coping valiantly with life's daily challenges, despite the risks, the sorrows, and the suspicion from the rest of the world.
The two bloggers quoted below illustrate Guinée's determination to survive.
Alimou Sow, a Guinean blogger, decided to eat some pizza with his wife and some friends at a small restaurant in the upper suburbs of Conakry, Guinée's capital.
He describes this experience of daily life in the capital with a distinct sense of humor:
From the inside perspective, it's as if our country has been ostracized.
The roar of airplanes passing overhead in Conakry has diminished considerably.
Foreigners have packed their bags, deserting the mining areas, hotels, and restaurants ... and bandwidth has increased on the Internet!
For some time now, the connection has become amazingly fluid.
Downloads are running smoothly. Meanwhile, seen from the outside world, through the prism of both new and traditional media, it's as if Guinée were nothing but an ocean of Ebola virus.
Many have barricaded themselves indoors, out of fear of being contaminated.
Friendship, solidarity, and conviviality have given way to suspicion and stigma.
Ebola will certainly find a place in training courses on international relations.
In fact, the epidemic has written a new chapter for the textbooks of that discipline.
Yet, we live on.
The heart of Conakry is still beating.
Always the same chaos on the two main roads: the same unscrupulous yellow taxis, the same human bodies packed like sardines into magbana taxi-buses, the same familiar noise that animates the life of my capital.
With horns that keep growing louder, the shouting of curses, and the barking of the coxeur touts, who are finishing up their day of petty larceny committed on passengers.
Markets are crowded, cafés are bustling.
The rumors and gossip, which are the very essence of Conakry, keep going strong.
Cireass, another blogger who writes about Guinée, chose a more direct approach to explaining both the epidemic and the challenges of informing the public:
Although it's not only Guineans who have done so, one big mistake made by our countrymen in the fight against Ebola Fever was to have politicized a situation which has nothing to do with politics.
Ever since the announcement of that epidemic, people denied its existence, without even trying to understand what it was.
The result: the Doctors Without Borders centers in the city of Macenta were vandalized by people who claimed that the disease was a lie (ed's note: the facility has resumed its activity). , even though no one could possibly benefit from having invented it as a myth.
Neither the Guinean authorities nor the international non-governmental organizations could profit by inventing a terrifying epidemic like that.
We shouldn't be looking for a hidden political motive behind everything.
And now, in the case of Ebola, Guinée has become completely isolated on the international stage.
The only way out of this unfortunate situation will be to work together, to combat Ebola, which is our true enemy.
It is also important to note that, in the race to cure Ebola, certain metropolitan areas such as the city of Télimélé, have been more resistant to the virus than others—a hopeful sign that could prove crucial to the medical research now underway.

In an image resonant of a Hollywood movie, attendees at the cremation of former deputy House speaker Apiwan Wiriyachai held up the three-finger salute to the former Prime Minister of the country Yingluck Shinawatra, in what could be seen as a silent message of hope for Thailand.
Please know : there are still many anti-coup Thais who refuse to be oppressed by the military
The image, which was originally posted on the BBC Thailand Facebook page has been shared on that platform over 650 times and shared on Twitter over 70 times, including re-tweets from Thais with large followings such as @toyubomm.
The BBC set up this Facebook page in an effort to avoid the systematic attack on the rule of law and liberties which followed May’s coup, including the banning of political gatherings and arresting and detaining hundreds of politicians and anti-coup activists.
The raised armed salute, inspired by the fantasy blockbuster "The Hunger Games," has been appropriated as the unofficial symbol of anti-coup activists and supporters of the pro-democracy movement.
This activity on Facebook and Twitter occurs at a time of increasing tension in the country, as the military junta continues its massive crackdown of online speech and personal expression in the country.
Having taken measures to censor citizens on social media and block hundreds of offensive websites, including the UK’s Daily Mail website, in the past week one of the major political blogs in Thailand on the Asian Correspondent website, Bangkok Pundit, announced that it is going on hiatus as a result of "the constrained environment of commenting publicly about Thai politics in the immediate aftermath of the coup."
Whilst the closure of the anonymous blog is another set-back for the freedom of expression of the Thai people, images such as the three-fingered salute being shared on social media provide a small glimmer of hope for the future of this once open and democratic country.

A scene from the first TMSummit in London in 2013.
All this week in Washington, DC, the Transformational Media Institute will convene a summit that brings together “changemakers, storytellers, and media professionals” from all over the world “to collaborate for good.”
This year’s TMSummit is the Institute’s second annual conference, running from October 26 until November 2, 2014.
During the week, associated events are taking place throughout the city, leading up to flagship events, including a workshop at the UN Foundation, on October 31, and the main summit day at George Washington University on November 1.
Participants at the TMSummit will discuss storytelling, collaborative creativity, new technology, sustainable business and living, wellbeing and health, photography, film and music, and journalism, among other issues.
According to its organizers:
The TMSummit will focus on how stories and media can create positive change by changing attitudes, bringing new technology solutions, awareness raising, inspiring action, or simply spreading happiness.
It brings together leading experts in their fields drawing people from a diverse range of organizations such as: the UN Foundation, Discovery Channel, MTV, and the Jane Goodall Institute.
Global Voices spoke to Jeremy Wickremer, who heads the TMSummit, to learn a bit more about the conference.
“It’s about creating a better world,” he says.
“It’s all interrelated: equality, property, the environment, health and wellbeing—they’re all connected.
You can’t tackle something in a silo,” he warns.
The Transformational Media Institute hopes to attract as broad an audience as possible for this year’s summit in Washington.
Wickremer expects a diverse group to attend, from high school students to artists to senior managers.
“It’s about seeing the big picture, so we should see a diverse group.”
The TMSummit's theme for 2014.
One of the summit’s main goals is to bring together people who otherwise might never cross paths, to promote new perspectives and build connections that lead to collaborations “for scaling up the social impact of what these people do.”
Readers wishing to know more about the TMSummit and the Transformational Media Institute can visit the summit’s website and the Institute’s website, Facebook page, and Twitter account.
Zainab Al Khawaja is once again in prison.
This photograph taken by Rebellious Feb14 is of a protest in Budaiya, Bahrain, on 18th May 2012 calling for her release.
Copyright: Demotix
This headline must be one of the worst things a journalist could write, and this topic must be one of the least written-about, but for the subject I'm writing about I felt it necessary to abandon everything I've been taught and write primitively.
This article was going to be about the arrest of Zainab Alkhawaja, a prominent activist in Bahrain.
I was going to start with the background, which is that she was arrested for a speech tweeted by her sister Maryam:
Urgent: Zainab Alkhawaja walked into court, asked to speak.
She said to judge: " I'm the daughter of a proud & free man..." CONT'D #Bahrain — Maryam Alkhawaja (@MARYAMALKHAWAJA) October 14, 2014
#PT " my mother brought me into this world free and i will give birth to a free baby boy even if it is inside ur prisons." CONT'D #Bahrain — Maryam Alkhawaja (@MARYAMALKHAWAJA) October 14, 2014
#PT " It is my right... and my responsibility.. as a free person.. to protest against oppression and oppressors."
CONT'D # Bahrain — Maryam Alkhawaja (@MARYAMALKHAWAJA) October 14, 2014 #PT She then ripped a picture of the king and placed it in front of the judge.
Zainab is at risk of arrest now; 8 months pregnant #Bahrain — Maryam Alkhawaja (@MARYAMALKHAWAJA) October 14, 2014
I would then have shared some of the reactions Maryam inspired, like how many started doing the same to the picture of the king, in solidarity with her:
Zainab was not posing on podiums, she didn't travel to stand in front of mics and take pictures with the elites among the politicians. For her, defiance was a lifestyle.
Oh brothers crossing the square while looking down
Defeated by the end of day
Be not ashamed and look up at me Because you are hanged by my side on the gallows of the cesar
Raise your eyes and look at me, for if your eyes met the death in mine
The desolation in you will smile for you have raised your head for once in your life
Atlas has thrown his burdens
now it's on those born in slavery
The sea is just like the desert, fills no thirst
Because the thirst of the rebels is only filled with tears
Behold the hanged rebel
Tomorrow you will end up like him
And kiss your wives here in the mid of the road
because here is where you will end
for kneeling is bitter
and the spider spinning a curse over the shoulder of men
Kiss your wives .. I left my wife without a kiss
And if you see my kid who I left on her arm missing an arm
Teach him how to kneel
God didn't forgive Satan when he said no
The meek
They inherit the earth
Because they don't get hanged
So teach him how to kneel
I would continue writing my clearly biased/inspired/unorthodox article, but the list of dead people and dead dreams, killed because they declared defiance, doesn't fit within the 1,000-word limit.
For now I leave you with one name: the unborn Abdulhadi, who will be born free, whether in prison or out.
Join us on October 21, Tuesday, for a conversation with Zainab's sister Maryam Al Khawaja about the arrest and the state of activism and protest in Bahrain, on our Hangout series GV Face.

As the confirmed Ebola death toll nears 5,000, with at least 10,000 reported cases, many in West Africa are utilizing the power of new media in the fight against the disease.
One such initiative is Ebola Alert in Nigeria:
EbolaAlert is an evidence-driven group of volunteer professionals working on Ebola Virus Disease Interventions.
It was created by Doctors but also involves active participation of other professionals from different walks of life.
The initiative uses Twitter to post daily Ebola-related news and to organise Ebola chat sessions between experts and the general public:
You can keep abreast of all the necessary information by following our activities on twitter.
From the daily #EbolaNews that is posted between 7AM and 8AM WAT to special activities like #EbolaScience where confusing Ebola issues are cracked and clarified.
The #EbolaChat Sessions are Twitter Events where Experts from around the world are available to discuss chosen topics with the general public.
There have been #EbolaChat Sessions on as many issues as you can imagine

Staff from Apple Daily News showed their determination to keep the newsroom operating after a mob attack on October 13.
Photo from Chan Pui Man's Facebook page.
Journalists working in Hong Kong have come under tremendous pressure in recent weeks for covering news on the Umbrella Revolution, the pro-democracy protests demanding free and fair elections.
Not only have they exposed themselves to violence while covering clashes between police and protesters, when they return to the office from the field, some of them have to endure the push for self-censorship from the newsroom or even harassment from pro-Beijing thugs.
Since police began removing barricades set up by protesters at the sites of the massive sit-in dubbed Occupy Central, confrontations between protesters and police officers have happened almost every day.
Standing between the police and protesters, photojournalists have become vulnerable to injuries themselves.
It is not uncommon to see TV station cameramen being pepper sprayed or pushed away by police officers during the news report.
In some cases, the police do not differentiate between protesters and reporters and assault them when they take photos of the front-line.
At 3 a.m., when covering the clearing of Tamar Park, a reporter from SocREC was pulled into the side of the riot police's line and beat up for about 30 seconds.
Later, two police officers dragged him along the road for 30 seconds and threw him into a police detention van.
The wounded reporter repeatedly displayed his press badge during the ordinal, but it did not stop them.
Instead, they abused him verbally.
Only after a police press officer confirmed his identity inside the van was he allowed to leave.
The reporter sought treatment at the Queen Mary Hospital and the clinical report found obvious injures on his face, forehead, nose, mouth, neck and left arm.
Similarly, a reporter from inmediahk.net covering the news inside a tunnel on Lung Wo Road was suddenly threatened by a police officer with pepper spray.
He followed the officer's instruction and backed off, but was sprayed in his face without warning; although he showed his press badge many times, he was arrested and handcuffed.
In the process, the police officer yelled: "Reporter?
So what?" "Even reporters cannot take photos from the front."
He was released after his identity was clarified.
Another inmediahk.net reporter was hit in the head by a riot police officer with his shield while he was backing off.
Even if reporters at the front-line risk physical injuries to cover the news, their stories might not be published because of self-censorship practices in the newsroom.
Many news organizations in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, were already fearful of losing advertising revenue from their business ties in the mainland or angering the Beijing government.
This trend has only increased with the recent protests calling for an open nomination system of candidates for the city's chief executive, which goes against the mainland's wish for a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee.
On October 15, the chief news executive of TVB, the city's most popular television station, ordered the news team to edit a voice-over describing a video report on alleged police brutality.
The footage clearly showed a handcuffed protester punched and kicked by several police officers in a dark corner for four minutes.
The next day, 28 staff members from the newsroom issued a joint statement expressing regret over the management's decision.
So far more than 100 staffs from the station's news branch have co-signed it.
A former TVB reporter Au Ka Lun explained how the TVB newsroom operates after he read the joint statement:
Every word in this plain statement is written in blood and sweat.
I read it and remembered the endless humiliation and struggle our generation of reporters has faced.
The huge gap between ideal and reality and whether one should stay or leave is always a struggle.
Most of the time, the reporters on the front-line are only responsible for interviews and recording what happens onsite.
They are like the workers in the sweatshop, responsible for a part of the news making.
After they have done their work, the footage would be sent back to the newsroom.
They won't be responsible for the script.
The content and the focus cannot be decided by the reporters.
In the newsroom, there are many news and assignment editors, and above them there is one more person in charge.
Above that person are even greater forces.
Reporters are not free and autonomous; they are only free when that single person is asleep, but he sleeps very little.
The "greater forces" referred to by Au are the different forms of political pressure coming from Beijing, such as smears or even violent threats.
Most media outlets in Hong Kong have compromised by incorporating self-censorship into their newsroom management like TVB.
For those who refused to comply, the threats are more explicit.
Since October 12, pro-Beijing mobs were mobilized to surround pro-democracy Apple Daily's headquarters and stop the media outlet from distributing their papers.
They blocked the entrance of Apple Daily on October 13 and obstructed the papers from being loading onto the trucks.
In addition, Apple Daily's website has suffered from cyber attacks that knocked the site offline and the telephone lines of its office were jammed with abusive phone calls. Despite the fact that the media outlet quickly obtained a restraining order from the court, the mobs continued roaming outside the entrance.

About 70,000 people attended Taiwan's LGBT pride parade on October 25 to celebrate the diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity and encourage the public to do the same.
The number of participants was one of the largest that the parade has seen since the first was held in 2003.
In recent years, it has become the biggest pride parade in Asia and attracted many overseas attendees.
The theme of the 2014 parade was ‘Walk in Queers’ Shoes,’ featuring voices from marginalized LGBT communities such as physically disabled people, HIV-positive people and sex workers.
Most of the participants in the parade voiced their support for the legalization of same-sex marriage.
A marriage equality bill was presented to the Legislative Yuan by the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights in 2012.
The legislature passed the first reading on October 25, 2013, but the legislative process was suspended in reaction to a massive mobilization of opponents of same-sex marriage.
Gay rights activists began pushing legislators to resume their work in early October this year and a public hearing for the bill was held on October 16.
Many couples in the LGBT communities took the opportunity of this year's pride parade to share their stories and hope with others.
Below are some photos from the parade.

Lusaka, Zambia.
Demotix.
Left in the dark about their leader's illness, Zambians were angry more than shocked to learn this week that the country's fifth president, Michael Sata, fondly known as King Cobra, died in London on October 28.
The government only recently acknowledged that the president was sick, waiting until October 20, four days before Zambia's 50th Independence Day, when Sata needed to be evacuated to Britain for emergency medical treatment.
At the time, the presidential palace stated simply:
His Excellency, Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, President of the Republic of Zambia, last night left for a medical check- up abroad First Lady Dr Christine Kaseba, some family members and his press aide have accompanied the Head of State.
This wasn't the president's first trip abroad to meet with foreign doctors, but it was the first time state officials admitted to Sata's medical needs.
In the past, his administration has denied rumors by cabinet members about his declining health, maintaining that Sata was fine and busy at work.
Earlier this year, the government told journalists that Sata spent a working holiday in Israel, though the Israeli media later reported that he was there to receive medical treatment.
The Zambian government's curious public relations hasn't gone unnoticed on social media.
On Facebook, B.M. Jermaine Sikombe reproduced the presidential palace's vague statement announcing Sata's passing.
Sikombe scoffed at the wording, calling on officials to take responsibility for leaving the public woefully misinformed.
AS YOU ARE AWARE, HIS EXCELLENCY MR. MICHAEL CHILUFYA SATA, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA HAS BEEN RECEIVING MEDICAL ATTENTION IN LONDON, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
HE LEFT ZAMBIA WITH THE FIRST LADY AND OTHER CLOSE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ON OCTOBER 20, 2014.
HOWEVER, IT IS WITH A VERY HEAVY HEART THAT I ADDRESSYOU TODAY, TO INFORM THE NATION THAT OUR BELOVED PRESIDENT AND LEADER, HIS EXCELLENCY, MR MICHAEL CHILUFYA SATA HAS PASSED ON.
Sikombe writes:
On his Facebook page, Emmanuel Mwamba, the former spokesman of Zambia’s second president, the late Frederick Chiluba, wrote:
When Zambians were confronted with sad pictures of a frail and clearly unwell President in April 2014, which immediately evoked feelings of concern and anxiety, government officials played down the concerns.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Harry Kalaba regularly issued ridiculous statements to Radio Phoenix such as “the Opposition leaders questioning the health of President Sata are malicious”.
“Sata will outlive his enemies that wish him dead”, President Sata is enjoying the best of his health”.
Of concern was the manner President Sata was carted around to; South Africa, India, United Kingdom and Israel in a secretive and hushed manner.
Recently the nation held with bated breath when President Sata opened the fourth session of Parliament on September 19th 2014. He looked seriously unwell.
Sata disappeared from the public eye last June, after he met a delegation of senior Chinese officials.
He briefly reappeared at the official opening of the 2014-2015 parliamentary session, where he failed to read his prepared speech.
He later traveled to New York to appear before the United Nations General Assembly, but he missed his allotted time slot to deliver his speech.
Zambian officials's public statements were equally misleading about the health of Levy Mwanawasa, the country's third president, who died in-office from a stroke in 2008.
While Mwanawasa was in a hospital bed, his vice president, Lupando Mwape, famously told the media that the president was jogging in London.
In June 2008, President Mwanawasa collapsed at a meeting of the African Union in Egypt.
He was rushed to France, where he died several weeks later.
Aécio Neves has filed suit against Twitter demanding it discloses information on 66 users; now bloggers claim he's using fake accounts to deal with negative YouTube videos.

Ten days ago, web documentary “Helicoca – The 60 Million Reais Helicopter” was removed from YouTube thanks to a copyright claim by a person named "Jorge Scalvini".
Local netizens have begun to suspect that the video's removal was set in motion by presidential candidate Aécio Neves.
The documentary investigates one of the largest drug seizures by police in Brazil’s history, in which half a ton of cocaine was found in a helicopter belonging to the powerful Perrella family.
The Perellas are key political allies of Aécio Neves, the Brazilian Social-Democratic Party (PSDB) presidential candidate and former governor of Minas Gerais, which borders both São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
The pilot and staff who helped maintain the helicopter were charged with the crime, while police rapidly dismissed the possibility of any involvement by the Perrella family.
The strange absence of information about the Perrellas' role in the incident motivated local journalists to further investigate the story.
Developed and commissioned via crowdfunding by Diário do Centro do Mundo, an independent, left-leaning news site, the documentary was directed by Joaquim de Carvalho, a seasoned journalist who has worked for major Brazilian news outlets such as O Estado de S. Paulo and TV Globo.
Diário do Centro do Mundo representatives say that the Scalvini account, which requested that YouTube remove Helicoca, is a fake:
We tried to find out who Scalvini is.
His email is zerobeta000@gmail.com.
We sent him a message to this address and received no reply.
It seems to be a fake profile after all.
Scalvini has a Twitter account, opened in 2012, with no tweets.
His profile on Facebook is empty, with a few likes on pages like "TV Revolta", "Mensaleiros na TV" e "Chega de Corrupção".
He has also an account on YouTube with his name.
He last logged in three months ago.
In order to avoid copyright infringement suits, the general practice at Google (owner of YouTube) is to remove such videos.
It is incumbent on the video's creator, and not the complainant, to prove that he or she has the right to present the video.
Diário do Centro do Mundo has appealed the case with Google and has been told to expect an official reply within 10 days' time.
Freitas wrote:
The video, as you can see, was taken down.
Some George Scalvini guy claimed intellectual ownership of the video.
It's needless to comment on the similarity between the two names.
Apparently, Aécio's campaign has a team specialized on not only taking down videos with accusations that could harm his candidacy, but also little jokes like this, that among all the examples of activist humor is one the most good-natured and inoffensive.
Although the documentary contains some footage of Neves taken by TV news stations, and thus potentially vulnerable to copyright violation claims, the spoof video includes no content of this sort.
What concerns netizens following the story is that both videos had their property rights challenged by the same person — who may not be a real person at all.
The only discernible connection between the two videos is the mentioning of Aécio Neves..
Suspicions have also been fueled by Neves' various past attempts to quiet criticism of his leadership on social media.
In late August, Neves filed a lawsuit against Twitter after the company refused to disclose information and IP addresses for 66 Twitter users.
The former governor claimed the accounts were all fake profiles orchestrated by a specific group to disseminate lies and criticism about him and his campaign.
Official documentation of the suit can be seen here.
Magazine Revista Fórum interviewed owners of a few of the accounts among the 66 named in the suit.
Among them is famous film critic Pablo Villaça, founder of Cinema em Cena, the oldest movie website in Brazil.
Villaça has publicly voiced his support for Neves' rival, current president Dilma Rousseff.
He told Revista Fórum about the accusations:
I think this is great, now he must prove actually exists.
I have been a political activist since I was 18 years old.
My mother fought against the dictatorship, my aunt went to jail and was tortured.
And he insinuates I am paid to be an activist.
In the previous week, senior executives in the US received letters with harsh considerations and serious criticism of the movie.
Letters were sent by PSDB of Minas Gerais. PSDB said my film was of a "political-partisan" nature and didn't represent the reality in the state, besides questioning the ethics of my conduct during the production of the film.
According to Florêncio, during an internal investigation at Current TV he had to prove to his journalism director Andrew Fitzgerald every statement he used in the movie and that the accusations made by PSDB were false.
A month later, Fitzgerald agreed to put the documentary back on the air.
In sum, these incidents have left bloggers concerned that the recent video removals are more than just coincidence.
And Neves' past behaviors suggest there may be more to come.

350.org's Pacific climate warriors paddled out into the Port of Newcastle, followed by hundreds of Australians and came head to head with gigantic coal ships on 17 October.
It truly was David versus Goliath.
The courage of the warriors was on full display as they faced off with the fossil fuel industry, which is threatening their homes.
Using hand carved canoes, they, along with dozens of Australians in kayaks, were able to prevent 10 scheduled ships from passing through the Newcastle coal port.
But most importantly, the warriors stood tall and their message was heard loud and clear: they are not drowning, they are fighting.
They will continue to fight, but they can not do it alone.
Here’s how it looked:

Guinea medical personnel are fearful following the death of 28 of their number and the hospitalization of 50 additional staff since September 17.
Compounding this situation, the lack of protective equipment is so serious that medical gloves are being sold on the black market.
Highlighting the atmosphere among care personnel, Amadou Tham Camara wrote the following on Guinea News:

According to data backed up by Amenisty International, 41 million girls can't even access elementary education.
Illiteracy, child marriage, teen pregnancy are part of a vicious cycle that especially affects our girls.
Thus, Latina America isn't exempted from this global issue, mainly about teen pregnancy:
Venezuela is top of the list in South America and third place in Latin America with the highest rate of early pregnancy.
Out of 100 Venezuelan women that get pregnant each year, 25 are teenagers, according to Telemedicine program at the Central University of Venezuela.
Among the causes of teen pregnancy, it's worth mentioning that one-third of unwanted pregnancies are a result of not using protection, and half of the girls affected didn't receive proper sexual and reproductive education before getting pregnant.
So, education is the only way.
By educating our girls today, we are empowering women of tomorrow, and therefore, their families and communities.

A comment about whether the population values the researches carried out from the universities, triggers member of academic community César Viloria to shed a light about this on his blog.
About research, we have to know it's divided in two branches: basic research and applied research.
The former increases or creates knowledge as well as develops and modificies what already exists.
On the other hand, applied research focuses in the application and usefulness of these knowledges on the population.
We can also find differences about times, the former has long term results and the latter shows medium term results.
You might be thinking now, what about all those formulas with impossible numbers?
The blog has also an answer to this question:
We find several elements in these items that can make difficult its reading, if we want to know “what is it about”, but they will be very useful if we are researches involved with the topic and what we want to know is “how they did it”.
Usually, however, on the introduction and conclusions of these texts, it's possible to understand a general idea of “what is this for".
For further information, Uninorte has launched a program called Science within reach, to make us feel part of the scientific community.

Screenshots of some of the participant videos from the Indigenous Language Challenge
Love it or hate it, the online buzz surrounding the Ice Bucket Challenge earlier this year brought more awareness to the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Participants filmed themselves dumping cold water on their heads and challenging another person to do the same or donate money toward research for a cure.
Now a similar concept aimed at awareness for indigenous languages is making its way around the internet.
In the Indigenous Language Challenge, the one who accepts the challenge must record a video speaking an indigenous language and tap someone else to do the same.
The outcome has been a wide range of people around the world who are producing videos, some for the first time, as a way to proudly share their language online and encouraging more to do the same.
A Facebook group was created to collect links to the videos, where people could share their motivations and connect with others taking part in the Challenge.
Many chose to upload their videos directly to Facebook where one can hear North American languages like Kwak'wala and Lakota, as well as the Miriwoong language from Australia, for example.
Efforts to pinpoint the origin of this challenge are ongoing, but according to the group administrator, one of the first participants was James Gensaw, speaking words in the Yurok language.
Who are some of the participants?
And why is this activity so important?
Colleen Fitzgerald, Director of the Native American Languages Lab at The University of Texas at Arlington, shares her thoughts on her blog post at the Huffington Post:
Many of these videos come from adults who are second language learners.
For many years, government-run boarding schools in both the U.S. and Canada took children from Native families.
This had an immense effect on Native language acquisition.
Children lost priceless years of daily home environments with parents and grandparents communicating to them in their language.
Home is where children's language development thrives and grows, and where children acquire the many different speech forms that express the human experience.
What gets lost?
So much, from the everyday language of instructions, telling jokes, or a recipe, to the ritual language of prayers, ceremonial speeches, or sharing stories of the ancestors.
Here are two examples of participants in this Challenge, who uploaded their videos to YouTube.
Jackelyn Seitcher speaking in the Nuu-chah-nulth language shares words after accepting the challenge.
Monica Peters takes the opportunity for the challenge to show the translations of works in Kanienkeha.
She then goes onto challenge members of the "Keeping the Kanienkeha Language Strong" Facebook group, community leaders and teachers, and students that are just starting out to speak the language.
There are other videos collected on the blog News From Native California.
Konwennenhon Marion Delaronde also posted her video in the group speaking Kanien'keha (Mohawk).
After being challenged by Kehte Deer, she enthusiastically took part and shared her reflections after uploading her video:
Already I think I heard all the languages from different nations.
I have to tell you all that all your languages are so beautiful.
Always speak your own languages if you can.
It’s hopeful.
I want to encourage all of you to continue to learn, continue to teach other and to really put your life into it, speaking.
I’m so happy that I can speak Mohawk.
I’m not fluent, a lot is still missing, but I want to thank everyone who has recorded themselves for this challenge, because you inspired me.
Pan African Vision's Ajong Mbapndah talks to Gershom Ndhlovu about the politics around the sickness and death of Zambia's president Michael Sata:
President Michael Sata recently passed away in London and it appears his health and medical condition where shrouded in secrecy, why were Zambians not notified of the Presidents failing health?
: An online publication, Zambian Watchdog, alerted the nation to President Michael Sata’s failing health more than two years before he passed on.
It is the same publication that could expose the secretive treatments abroad that he used to take.
Both senior government officials and ruling party cadres were not happy with the publication for keenly following and exposing Mr Sata’s condition and there were many attempts to shut down the online publication which was at times blocked for access to people in Zambia.
On the question of why, obviously the government and the party wanted to show that the President was healthy and discharging his functions.
They probably did not want to admit the fact because of a constitutional clause which calls for the removal of the office holder, once declared unfit by a medical board if called by Cabinet.
In fact, one citizen attempted to compel Cabinet to call for such a board through the High Court but his application was dismissed.

#DistrictThai demonstration in London, via the District Thai Facebook page.
A group of Thai citizens gathered outside London's Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square on Monday, November 10, as the theater hosted the international premiere of "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1," to draw attention to the real-life threats to democracy, the freedom of expression, and the rule of law in Thailand.
The film is significant for many Thais.
Indeed, opponents of Thailand's recent coup, which displaced the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, have even adopted the movie's famous three-finger salute.
The gesture has become so popular that the country's military junta actually banned it, along with several other forms of political dissent.
Hundreds of Thais recently used the salute at the cremation ceremony for former Deputy House Speaker Apiwan Wiriyachai, greeting Yingluck Shinawatra with the three fingers, when she arrived to pay her respects.
Many of the activists in London this week wore masks, for fear of reprisals against their friends and families still in Thailand.
The activists set up a Facebook page and a Twitter account to coordinate their efforts, using the hashtag #DistrictThai.
"District" is a reference to the plot of "The Hunger Games," where a centralized, authoritarian dictatorship rules different geographic areas ("districts").
Most of the districts are impoverished and enslaved to the "Capital."
Activists' social media accounts are maintained in Thai and in English, serving audiences both at home in Thailand and around the world.
The group's Facebook page was popular, attracting more than 1,000 "likes" in a single weekend.
The first message appeared on Friday, November 7:
The staff at London's Odeon Cinema noticed the #DistrictThai demonstration right away, tweeting:
#DistrictThai are in town and they look awesome.
A for effort! #mockingjay pic.twitter.com/DlSlDokSgO — ODEON (@ODEONCinemas) November 10, 2014

Thai politics became even more chaotic today when the country's former prime minister was impeached by a legislative body, which was appointed by a military-backed government.
The National Legislative Assembly (NLA) went through the motions of a secret ballot to impeach former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra over corruption related to a rice pledging scheme intended for small farmers that she supervised.
The program involved the government buying the rice output of local farmers at high a price before reselling the rice to the global market.
But critics saw the rice subsidy program as a disastrous populist policy that was implemented to benefit the support base of Yingluck's party in the north part of the country.
Yingluck is the first female prime minister of the kingdom, and whose Pheu Thai party-led coalition won the election in 2011.
However the military has ruled Thailand since May 2014.
The military has drafted a new constitution and appointed several bodies to rule the country and implement electoral and political reforms as part of the normalization process.
The NLA is one of the institutions created by the military to oversee the country's transition.
The impeachment reflected the desire of the military to block Yingluck's return to politics.
Security forces were on a state of alert around the parliament during the assembly.

NCPO & police at SC Park Hotel.
A translated copy of her statement, as reported on by the Pheu Thai party website, highlights:
I would like to reaffirm that I am innocent.
I would like to thank the minority that voted against the impeachment.
I praise you for your strength in upholding the principle of justice.
Despite the fact that the process to impeach me was rushed and due process was ignored to the extent it stripped me my basic rights which every Thai citizen is entitled to, I believed that I did my best to present my case.
I insist that the Rice Pledging Scheme is beneficial for the farmers and the country, and the scheme did not incur losses as alleged.
Any figures on the losses from the scheme have all been manipulated with bias towards me and with a hidden agenda used to eliminate a political opponent.
Worst of all, the rice farmers’ lives have become a political tool.
In the matter of the charges filed by the Attorney General, the former prime minister also said,
It is regrettable that the many so called coincidences that I spoke of yesterday happened once again today.
Just an hour before the NLA vote on impeachment, the Office of the Attorney General decided to file criminal charges against me for negligence of duty.
This is in conflict with the comments made by the head of prosecuting team that there is not yet enough probable cause.
The Office of the Attorney General is an institution that has long played a key role in ensuring justice.
Yet their actions on this issue are deemed to be questionable.
In her statement, she decried what she called the absence of democracy and the rule of law, particularly for the farmers.
While the impeachment did not come as a surprise, some provided their analysis of the situation.

Troubled times are brewing, and as long as the country is under martial law, without public participation in governance and accountability, the purge of political opponents will continue.
Kolinda Grabar Kitarović: "Hahaha, everybody is saying that we don't get along, and in the meantime, we're treating ourselves.”Ivo Jospović's reply: "Thank you!
Here, have a cookie!”Cartoon by Nik Titanik, republished with permission.
Former NATO Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy Kolinda Grabar Kitarović has been elected Croatia's first woman president, defeating the incumbent president in the first presidential elections since the small southeastern European country joined the European Union last year.
Grabar Kitarović won in a tight race against incumbent President Ivo Jospović in the runoff in January 2015, netting 50.74% of the votes, according to preliminary results.
She will be inaugurated on February 18, 2015.
As Croatia's first woman president, and the country's fourth elected president since independence, she will undoubtedly leave her mark on both the country and region.
But despite her historic win, many citizens who would have preferred a different political representative are worried as to how their views and needs will be represented with her at the helm.
"Teacher, the test is over, but Bosnia is still writing!"This meme has widely circulated following Croatia's presidential runoff.
The diaspora is often called out for favoring right-wing political parties, while not living and paying taxes in Croatia.
A member of the Croatian Democratic Union, the party instrumental in Croatia gaining independence in 1992, Grabar Kitarović is eager to bring what she has called "the Croatian spirit" back, as well as re-enforce "traditional" values.
The country is highly divided between the available center-left and center-right political options, and she only defeated Josipović by only a few thousand votes.
Josipović becomes the first Croatian president since the country's independence who didn't win reelection for a second term, as both Franjo Tuđman, Croatia's first president, and Stjepan Mesić were both reelected for two full terms each.
In the eyes of many voters, Josipović hasn't done much for Croatians during his mandate as president.
The road to a runoff
The race seems to have been dirty and expensive.
The first round of elections was held on December 28, 2014, with four candidates for its presidency: Ivan Vilibor Sinčić, a young political activist, who was the biggest surprise and managed to take 16.42% of the vote; Milan Kujundžić, a right-wing politician, who won only 6.30% votes; Grabar Kitarović, representing the center-right Croatian Democratic Union, who took 37.88%; and incumbent President Josipović, who won 38.48% votes.
The president can't be elected unless he or she secures more than 50% of the votes.
Because none of the four managed to surpass the 50% threshold (only 47.14% of the total electorate voted in first round), Grabar Kitarović and Josipović went head to head on January 11.
During the campaign, the candidates offered up many plans for the country, still struggling with a troubled economy, high unemployment, low GDP and corruption.
However, despite the amount of money poured into the elections, presidential power is actually very limited within the Croatian government, with the president mainly acting as a representative within the country and abroad and performing ceremonial duties such as awarding important individuals.
No matter how divided we are in these or future electoral percentages, the bad economical percentages are the same for everyone #izboriprh (#electionscroatia)
Nevertheless, candidates sought votes through television debates, which often left the average voter wanting for a concrete reason to give either candidate their vote.
Debates did, however generate some humorous tweets from Croatian social media users under the hashtags #izboriprh (#electionscroatia), #izbori2014 (#elections2014), #debataRTL (#debateRTL), and #HRTizbori (#HRTelections).
Between Ivo Josipovića and Kolinda Grabar Kitarović I can only choose an invalid voting ballot. #izboriprh #izbori2014
One tweet summed up the general sentiment: What is saddest is that this historical event, in a patriarchal state, is probably not seen as a victory by any feminist. #izboriprh
Libela.org, an independent portal on gender, sex and democracy in Croatia, asked whether Grabar Kitarović is capable of uniting the nation and working in favor of women's rights, despite the fact she did not play the "female card" during the elections.
A nation is made of people, and the people of Croatia have chosen Kolinda Grabar Kitarović to be their next president, as is supposed to happen in a democracy.
Time will tell how much good the people's choice will bring the country.
Human rights groups were blocked by the police from getting near the pope motorcade.

Not everyone in the Philippines was able to see Pope Francis when he began his current visit to the Philippines.
A group activists carrying signs for social justice says the police prevented it from staging a demonstration in sight of the Pope's motorcade.
There are also reports that law enforcement officers detained several street children during the Pope's public procession.
Pope Francis will tour the Philippines from January 15 to January 19.
The visit, themed "mercy and compassion," takes Pope Francis to the largest Catholic-dominated nation in Asia.
Some 2,000 activists gathered in Manila to greet the Pope by unfurling banners that highlight some of the issues that affect the nation's poor, such as hunger, landlessness, and injustice.
Police blocked the march from getting near the motorcade, however.
Activist leader Nato Reyes criticized the government for stopping various groups from trying to tell the Pope about the Philippines' "real situation":
From Day 1, there has been a conscious effort to regulate what the Pope can see and hear.
It is monumentally ironic since the Pope did not come here to see only ” true, the good and the beautiful”.
The Pope came here to hear about the problems of the poor and marginalized.
Police barred a group of activists from marching near the Pope's motorcade.

Some political prisoners were able to hang a banner outside their cell.
They urged the Pope to look into the worsening human rights situation in the country.

In addition to interfering with protesters, the government also reportedly “detained” and “caged” street children a few days before the Pope's arrival.
Manila Standard Today, a major daily newspaper, questioned the wisdom of this policy, saying it amounts to a Potemkin-Village approach.
The government has denied detaining street children during the Pope’s visit.
Meanwhile, officials erected a green wall along the Pope's motorcade route, preventing him and other motorists from seeing the urban poor who live beyond the barrier.
Another “barrier” separating the Pope from the people was the heavy security.
Many said the deployment of police and placement of metal barriers throughout the city was excessive, making it difficult for people even to glimpse the nation's special guest.
Several disgruntled Filipino Internet users pointed to the Pope’s recent visit to Sri Lanka, where he was seen touching and blessing the hands of the faithful along the road.
Overkill police deployment?

The government says the strict security detail is a necessary precaution.
Still, many continue to urge authorities to respect the wishes of the faithful and let them closer to the Pope:
Sure it's for security purposes but I think the Pope would really like to reach out to the people hidden by hundreds of security personnel. — Kat De Castro⭐♎ (@KatDeCastro) January 16, 2015
Nonoy Oplas criticized the “militarized security system” adopted by the government:
Seeing him on the road is the closest thing (the people) can get and see the Pope.
And the paranoid security system tried hard to make the public's view of the Pope as short as possible, as far as possible.
Many are hoping the government will rethink its security arrangements in the days ahead, to allow more people to lay eyes on Pope Francis, before he departs on January 19.
Nigerian pastor Esther Ibanga joined with Muslim leaders in the city of Jos to call for the return of Chibok girls who were kidnapped by the extremist group Boko Haram.

Published with PRI's permission
This article and a radio report by Joyce Hackel for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on January 14, 2015 and is republished as part of a content-sharing agreement.
With all eyes turned on France last week, a massacre perpetrated by religious extremists in a northeastern Nigerian town called Baga barely registered around the globe.
That disparity in news coverage jumps out, especially to Nigerians.
Esther Ibanga, a pastor in the town of Jos and a founder of a group called Women Without Walls, says she would have hoped the world would have paid more attention to the Boko Haram assault that took hundreds, perhaps thousands of Nigerian lives.
"I was angry in my heart.
But my anger was toward my government," says Ibanga, the pastor of Jos Christian Missions.
"Because my government and my rulers have to value their own people.
If you don't value your own people first, why would you expect someone else to value them?"
Jos is the capital of Plateau State in Nigeria's Middle Belt.
It lies hundreds of miles south of Boko Haram strongholds in Borno State in Nigeria's northeast.
Religious tensions in the Middle Belt pre-date Boko Haram and began most recently in the mid-1990s.
"It's unfortunate, but over the years we sort of got used to it, that Christians and Muslims don't get on well together," Ibanga says.
Even after the tensions had become commonplace, the severity of a 2010 massacre in the town of Dogo-Nahawa turned Ibanga and other local women into vocal activists.
"The war was taken into the bedrooms," she says.
"The village that was attacked, they actually went right into their bedroom at night when they were sleeping and started killing them."
In response, Ibgana organized 100,000 women, mainly Christians, in a march through Jos.
The idea, she recalls, was "to let the government know the women on the plateau were not going to keep quiet any more."
But in the weeks that followed, Ibanga and others discovered that the extremist violence in Dogo-Nahawa was in fact a reprisal attack — in response to an earlier assault in the region by Christian militants.
"The Muslim women now reacted and said, 'Hey, wait a minute, our own people were killed as well,'" she recalls.
So Muslim women in Jos held their own, separate rally.
But even after the Christian and the Muslim demonstrations, the violent clashes continued.
At that point, Ibanga reached out to a local Muslim religious leader, Khadija Hawaja.
"That's when I realized the issue is really not religion, the issue was politics.
But religion was used as a very powerful tool," she says.
"I reached out to her and I said, 'Hey listen, you know we're not each other's problems.
It's not about you being a Muslim and me being a Christian.
These politicians are knocking our heads together.
And it's all about them maintaining power.'"
Because Jos was so politically polarized, the women met on "neutral ground" — in a restaurant.
"She could have been killed," Ibanga says.
"And I could have been killed also, going into a Muslim community."
After months of collaboration, Ibanga and Hawaja founded the Women Without Walls Initiative.
"We want to do away with the walls that divide and separate us, whether it's the walls of social class or the wall of ethnicity or the walls of religion," she says.
"We really cannot join the politicians in this fight.
We are mothers.
We are life givers and we are solution bearers.
And we think that we should bring solutions to the table, rather than dwell on the problem."
On January 19, Congolese police in Kinshasa violently dispersed protesters opposed to the revision of the electoral law that would allow Joseph Kabila to remain in power.
35 protesters, most of them students, and 1 policeman were killed.
The city of Goma was also affected by clashes that saw the arrest of many among the thousands of protesters.
Kabila seeks to indirectly extend his term, which is coming to an end next year, by organizing a census that would take 3 years to complete.
Kabila is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term, however his term would be automatically prolonged until the census is completed.
Shortly after the protests, mobile internet and texting were shut down briefly as well as most schools in the city.
Some dormitories were set ablaze during the clashes.
The Kabila administration argues that a census is necessary prior to issuing the electoral lists for the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2016.
The very influential Catholic Church has backed the opposition request to forego any revision to the planned electoral calendar.
The proposed revision is currently under review at the Senate.
The following citizen video taken by Kininfos on January 19 depicts a chaotic scene in the capital city as protesters try to block the streets:
Paul Nsapu, secretary general for Africa of the International Federation for Human Rights in Kinshasa, is appalled by the excessive measures taken by the government:
For the most part these people were killed while they were advancing to protest.
We didn't expect the government to act in the same way as a rebel group.
The following video provides a recap of the events over the past week :
Ida Sawyer, DR Congo Researcher for Human Rights Watch, adds that the repression is in contradiction with the rights of citizens to express themselves:
Congolese security forces have fired into crowds of demonstrators with deadly results.
People should be allowed to express their views and peacefully protest without the fear of being killed or arrested
CPJ's Africa Program Coordinator, Sue Valentine argues that shutting down internet and SMS communication in the country is an infringement on basic Congolese rights:
By shutting down internet and messaging services and blocking websites, Congolese authorities are denying citizens their fundamental right to communicate and to receive and impart information
Jason Stearns explains why these protests have a different feel on his Congo Siasa blog:
Students are now playing a much more important role than in 2011.
The epicenter of the protests has been at the University of Kinshasa (UNIKIN), which has been stormed by presidential guards and police.
There are over 30,000 students at the university, and hundreds of thousands of students across the country.
In Bukavu, too, university students were at the forefront of demonstrations organized yesterday.
In the past, the political fervor of university campuses has often been tempered when student bodies have been co-opted by political elites.
This time that seems to be different.
Joseph Kabila took power in 2001 following the assassination of his father Laurent Kabila.
Under Congolese law, the Congolese National Police are responsible for providing security and ensuring public order during demonstrations.
The national police chief can call on the regular Congolese army to provide assistance if police forces are overwhelmed.
Wekesa Sylvanus hopes that 2015 will be a year of free and fair elections in Africa:
https://wekesasylvanus.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/will-2015-be-a-year-of-free-and-fair-elections-in-africa/
Since the advent of multi party democracy in Africa, electoral contests have become a do or die affair in majority of African countries.
Elections in Africa are a high risk affair and in the recent times, they have been a trigger of conflicts.
Kenya and Ivory Coast are good examples of how mismanaged elections can plunge a country into a conflict.
Half a century after gaining independence, majority of African states have not got it right in terms of conducting and managing free and fair elections.
The year 2015 will see a host of African countries go through elections.
Presidential elections and/or legislative elections will be held in Nigeria, Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, Togo, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Central Africa Republic, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea, Chad, and Egypt and may be South Sudan depending on the peace deal to be signed.
Most of these countries have struggled to institute the practice of democracy in recent times.
2015 therefore presents a great opportunity for them to show the world that they have matured democratically.

Ugandans are taking advantage of social media to bridge the gap between citizens and legislators, thanks to Parliament Watch Uganda, a virtual tracker that monitors the Parliament of Uganda on a regular basis and provides both relevant data and expert analysis.
On 26 February, 2015, the initiative organized the #MPsEngage Twitter chat with women members of Parliament (MPs) to discuss the topic 'Making Women Count in Legislative Processes'.
Three audiences participated in the chat in real time: the people of Gulu in Northern Uganda, female members of parliament and Uganda's social media audience.
Gulu is a post conflict district in Northern Uganda.
It was the center of conflict between the government of Uganda and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).
Women in the area face many challenges inherited from the war and the general neglect of the central government.
Members of the audience in Gulu asked questions via microphones, which were tweeted to the MPs by a social media expert in the audience.
During the chat, the female MPs were tasked to take stock of their achievements and challenges that they've faced during their term in office.
Ugandan social media users took it upon themselves to comment, quote and direct the attention of their followers to #MPsEngage.

Uganda's president Yoweri Museveni.
Photo released under Creative Commons by Russell Watkins/Department for International Development UK).
Seventy percent of Ugandans are under the age of 29.
That means they have seen only one president since they were born.
On 26 January, 2015, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) celebrated 29 years in power.
This day was set apart as the liberation day to mark the day NRM took over power after a five-year armed struggle against repressive governments.
President Museveni is already seeking a sixth presidential term.
Billboards erected by his party supporting his intention to continue ruling the country are all over the capital city Kampala.
To gather public support for his intention to run again, Museveni has been seen handing out brown envelopes of money to poor people during public gatherings, something he has also done in the past.
He has come under public criticism for treating the national treasury as his Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).
For many Ugandans, the celebration of the liberation day was a moment to take stock of the governance of the NRM and the promises the the NRM made when they came into power.
George Ayittey, a Ghanaian economics professor and president of Free Africa Foundation in Washington, DC, reminded the rest of the world what Museveni said when he became president of Uganda in 1986:
In 1986, President Museveni told us, "No African president should be power for more than 10 years."
He himself is still there 29 years later — George Ayittey (@ayittey) January 4, 2015
Ugandan journalist Benjamin Rukwenge is tired of Twitter users complaining instead of doing something about the situation:
Whatever your sentiments, you can't argue with history. #NRM has lots of +ves to its 29yrs.
While Edgar Mwine, an unemployed graduate of economics, quoted lawyer, policy analyst and social entrepreneur Godber Tumushabe:
"It's insulting to the intelligence of Ugandans to say that 29 years of Museveni Rule is a success" @godbertumushabe #HotSeat — Mwine (@mwineedgar) January 28, 2015
Museveni said in a speech that he said he will never give power to the opposition, whom he called wolves, because he has the support of the army.
Commenting on an article about the speech on the Daily Monitor website, "Kabindist" wrote:
So its official.There is no democracy in Uganda.Its about Museveni and his Army.So,all these years when he said he needed more time to professionalize the Army,he meant brain wash it to do his bidding.Term limits,age limits and all the above are but play things for Kaguta.He believes his day will not come.With his NRM wolves the country is already torn apart and like a greedy wolf he wont let go.Who is he lying to?
Commenting on the same story, Bishanga Paul warned Museveni:
Gadafi had a strong Army and was csupported by the people who later got disgusted and dragged him through the city to see him off the country of Libya forever.
And to drive the point home, the Daily Monitor illustrated:
CARTOON: Today, marks 29 years since the NRM assumed power. @chrisatuk #NRM29 pic.twitter.com/Kf2ivmpDzz — Daily Monitor (@DailyMonitor) January 26, 2015
In his criticism of Museveni, Charles Onyango Obbo, Mail & Guardian Africa editor, compared Museveni to Lords Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony:
To begin with, Kony and Museveni are the longest serving post-1986 leaders of their respective organisations.
Counting from when he came to power, Museveni has been leader of NRM, president and commander-in-chief for 29 years.
Kony effectively became leader of the LRA in 1988, after cobbling it together from the remnants and other dregs of Alice Lakwena’s defeated Holy Spirit Movement.
Kony has, therefore, led LRA for 26 years, the only rebel leader of the Museveni era who comes close to The Chief.
When it comes to military and political survival, therefore, Museveni and Kony are in a class of their own.
I think Museveni will outlast Kony, but strange things happen in our neck of the woods so I wouldn’t place a bet on it.
In December last year, the Daily Monitor quoted Museveni saying that Ugandans do not want him to leave.
He blamed his clinging to power to Ugandans who keeps re-electing him.
Northern Cameroon border, where Boko Haram operates
On February 4, Boko Haram conducted a particularly gruesome attack on the town of Fotokol in Northern Cameroon, right across the Nigerian border.
Hundred of civilians are feared dead, 81 confirmed so far by the Minister of Defense.
Local Human Rights Organization believes that close to 370 civilians were killed.
Local testimonies mention scores of bodies in the streets with their throats slit.
The town of Fotokol has been subjected to battles between Boko Haram and Camerronian and Chadian armed forces recently: March 2014, August 2014 and October 2014.
Cameroonian Blogger Noelle Lafortune reports that the attack signals that Boko Haram might be losing ground in the region:
On the frontline, doubt might be switching sides.
The emergence of the Chadian army in support of the Cameroonian and Nigerian military appears to be decisive, given the panic moves that has seemingly gripped Boko Haram.
The firepower of the coalition forces routed Shekau (head of Boko Haram) and his gang.

This week The Intercept revealed a rating system that the US government encourages social workers, teachers and law enforcement workers to use to detect potential terrorists.
The ranking system is "supposed to alert US government officials to individuals at risk of turning to radical violence, and to families or communities at risk of incubating extremist ideologies."
The system detailed in a 36-page internal government document obtained by the digital magazine was put together by the National Counterterrorism Center and is part of a wider government strategy for Countering Violent Extremism, which calls for local community and religious leaders to work together with law enforcement and government agencies.
The White House is currently hosting an international 3-day summit on Countering Violent Extremism with representatives from over 60 countries.
Under categories like “Expressions of Hopelessness, Futility,” “Talk of Harming Self or Others,” and “Connection to Group Identity (Race, Nationality, Religion, Ethnicity)," the ranking system asks teachers, social workers and police officers to rank individuals from 1 to 5.
While reading the document at Global Voices, we couldn't help but laugh out loud because of the reductive approach of the survey.
We decided to make our own quiz based on the simplistic assumptions the National Counterterrorism Center made, in its ranking system.
Take our satirical quiz.

Yemen is in political limbo, without a president and government, since the Houthi militias took over government institutions and the presidential palace in capital city Sanaa.
On February 8, they released a document with a Ministry of Interior logo banning all protests in Yemen.

Déjà Vu?
President Edgar Lungu on a helicopter ride viewing the South Luangwa National Park during a holiday he took two weeks into office.
Picture used with permission of Salim Henry/SHENPA.
Just after winning the election to replace Sata, Lungu underwent medical tests at Lusaka Trust Hospital and Maina Soko Military Hospital, both of which are within a short distance from the presidential palace in the Woodlands district of the capital city.
Departing from his predecessor’s practice of not announcing his health-related matters, Lungu’s press aide Amos Chanda said in a statement:
His Excellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the Republic of Zambia has today undergone two medical examinations at Maina Soko Military Hospital and Lusaka Trust Hospital respectively.
President Lungu undertook a Baseline Health Parameters routine check-up at Maina Soko and attended the dentistry at Lusaka Trust Hospital.
Doctors have given him a clean bill of health.
Nevertheless, his holiday, which began after his first international assignment on a trip to the African Union (AU) summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, raised eyebrows.
Lawyer-turned-politician Lungu, who went to the South Luangwa National Park, one of Zambia’s prime tourist destinations, had not finished picking his Cabinet at the time.
President Lungu, quoted in The Post, defended his decision to go on what he called a retreat:
I told you that I will have no honeymoon.
There is a difference between a holiday and a retreat, I was looking at the dictionary this morning and I said, ‘do these people know?’
I am going for a retreat, I am not on holiday.
You don’t go on holiday with the full complement of office staff.
The Secretary to the Cabinet is going and some of my ministers and State House officials are not going to nurse me, but help me think through the appointments I am making.
He added:
I know my priorities; some cheeky fellows are saying ‘Lungu doesn’t know his priorities’.
My priority is the people of Zambia.
How I treat my work is not anybody’s prerogative, it is mine.
In the run-up to the January 20 election, Opposition United Party for National Development Vice President Canicius Banda, a medical doctor, said that the burden of proof lay with ruling Patriotic Front President Lungu to convince the nation that he was well because a medical report his party had seen indicated that the now head of state allegedly suffered from a kidney problem.
Banda later recanted his claim about seeing Lungu’s medical report.
Blogger Elias Munshya Munshya, in response to Banda’s claims of having seen Lungu’s medical report, wrote:
I do see why some Zambians should be concerned about the health of presidential candidates.
But demanding medicals for candidates is as ridiculous as demanding that candidates be of a certain level of education.
If indeed we should be caring about medical reports, then the next questions to deal with would be: where are we going to draw the line?
Does evidence of a disease of the lung affect a person’s ability to rule?
This is why our constitution only states that one should not lead if they are “incapacitated”.
It does not say that one must not rule if they are sick, for such a requirement would be impossible to meet by mere mortals.
It is understandable why Zambians are concerned with the health of their presidents or those aspiring to be presidents.
Former President Frederick Chiluba, who served as the country's second president, died in Zambia following a series of trips to South Africa for treatment and check-ups for heart-related complications.
Lungu beat 10 other candidates, scraping by just 1.66 per cent over the nearest rival, opposition UPND’s Hakainde Hichilema, to become Zambia’s sixth president since independence from Britain in 1964.

The Nigerian Independent National Election Commission (INEC) announced on February 7, 2015, that presidential election due on February 14 would be pushed back by six weeks because of security concerns in areas held by militant group Boko Haram.
The group has increased its campaign of violence in northern Nigeria.
Recently, it conducted what Amnesty International described as the group’s “deadliest massacre in recent history” in Baga, a town in the north-eastern state of Borno.
The chairman of the election commission Attahiru Jega said that security forces would be conducting a six-week special operation against Boko Haram so "they would rather not be distracted by the elections." The government has vowed to finish off the group in six weeks.
This is the first time in Nigeria’s history that the presidential election is being postponed.
However, this is not the first time a national election will postponed in Nigeria.
In 2011, we reported the reaction of Nigerian netizens to the rescheduling of the national parliamentary elections.
Since the announcement, there has been many speculations as to the real reasons for the postponement.
For example, 'Gbénga Sèsan, the director for Paradigm Initiative Nigeria, thinks that the electoral commission was forced to postpone the election:
1
It is clear that this postponement decision, by @inecnigeria, was forced.
This has a lot of implications regarding #NigeriaDecides — 'Gbénga Sèsan (@gbengasesan) February 7, 2015
Henrik Angerbrandt, a PhD candidate in political science and researcher at the Nordic Africa Institute, believes the postponement has more to do with politics than security.
He wonders why the offensive against an insurgency that has lasted for six years coincides with the date of the presidential election.
Less than three weeks ago, the national security advisor to the president called for the elections to be postponed.
However, this was not because the security agents were unprepared but because of slow distribution of voters’ cards.
INEC, the responsible authority, replied there was no reason for postponement.
Hence, it looks like a last resort has been to return to the security argument, first articulated in September by the PDP Senate President.
There are different theories on what PDP benefits from the postponement.
As the election has come closer, opinion polls have shown growing dissatisfaction with Jonathan’s government and Buhari has emerged as a possible winner of the election.
A postponement would provide an opportunity for Jonathan to recover some lost grounds.
As incumbent party, PDP is furthermore believed to benefit from more resources than APC, making an extended campaign phase seem preferable.
Another possible advantage is that despite long resistance from Jonathan, neighbouring countries are increasingly present in the combat of Boko Haram and some extra weeks may halt the loss of territory to the insurgents.
That would make Jonathan have something to show the many critics that have questioned both his capability and commitment to respond to Boko Haram.
He notes that the postponement has been met with widespread disappointment and suspicion.
He wonders what will happen if the objectives of the special operation are not met after six weeks:
The initial responses to the postponement express widespread disappointment and suspicion.
The opposition candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, and major actors in civil society have appealed for calm, but the decision triggers major discontent.
Ahead of the decision, Nigerians gathered for protests in the streets in Lagos and Abuja.
If there would be nationwide demonstrations, there are many places in which there is a high risk for violence.
The special operation that the military commences is scheduled for six weeks.
The record of the military’s operations in the north east in the last six years offers few indications that the situation will have improved significantly in these weeks.
The question is what will happen if the objectives of the operation are deemed not to have been accomplished at this time.
Will the military call for postponement for another month?
The end of April is the upper limit according to the constitutional requirements for when elections must hold.
Or, even worse, will there be a suggestion for an interim government?
Moyosore Ayodele also wonders how Boko Haram can be defeated in six weeks after terrorising the country for six years:
6yrs, Boko haram couldn't be won, but we want to win it within 6weeks because of election.
So glaring PDP=Boko haram. #nigeriaelection — Moyosore Ayodele (@mohyur) February 8, 2015
Ruggedman asks:
Plans for d 2015 elections did not start today,who fixed the February date for the millitary activity? #Nigeriadecides #NigeriaElection — Ruggedman (@RuggedyBaba) February 7, 2015
Twitter user President Obiang notes sarcastically:
After many years, it is good to hear that President #Goodluck Jonathan needs just 6 more weeks to deal with Boko Haram. #Nigeriadecides — President Obiang (@PresidentObiang) February 7, 2015
According to Alexander Osondu, the postponement is a violation of Nigeria’s constitution:
7
The election slated for March 28 is in flagrant breach of the provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria. @Nigeria_Law #NigeriaDecides — Alexander Osondu (@MovingLaw) February 11, 2015
1. @Nigeria_Law the provision of the Constitution is very clear on the postponement of the elections.
S.123(1) #NigeriaDecides — Alexander Osondu (@MovingLaw) February 11, 2015
Adaure Achumba, the West Africa correspondent for AriseTV, disagrees:
Constitution is clear #NigeriaElection must be held no earlier than 90 days & no later than 30 days before May 29.
April 29 last legal date — Adaure Achumba (@adaure) February 7, 2015
This is one of the reasons some are speculating that led to the postponement:
Start early, gather enough money so that we can out-spend them.
Just when it's close, postpone it.
They will run out of cash #NigeriaDecides — Akin Ibitoye (@aibitoye) February 11, 2015
Ryan Cummings, a South African security analyst, says postponing election because of Boko Haram is nonsensical:
It would've been an easier sell to postpone elections due to PVC distribution problems. #BokoHaram issue nonsensical #Nigeriadecides — Ryan Cummings (@Pol_Sec_Analyst) February 7, 2015
By the time of writing this, 316 Twitter users have retweeted and 16 favourited the following tweet after a call by Voice of America Hausa to its followers to express their opinion about the postponement:

The cover photo from Masih Alinejad's Facebook page "My Stealthy Freedom"
London based Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad won the 2015 Women's Rights Award at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy for her Facebook page "My Stealthy Freedom" this past week.
The page invites Iranian women to post pictures of themselves without a Hijab, in defiance of Iran's Islamic laws that enforce compulsory hijab.
With over 750, 000 followers, this page has been considered something of social media movement for Iranian women.
Below is a video from her acceptance speech at the Summit:
Organised by Africa is a Country blog, White History month 2015 is coming next month:
Last March was the inaugural White History Month here on Africa is a Country, and without tooting too loudly on our own vuvuzela, it was kind of brilliant.
So we’re going to do it again.
We featured stuff like Kathleen Bomani’s Leather from Human Skin in 1880s Philadelphia and pulled together a wide range of material, from Britain’s mass torture regime in 1950s Kenya to that time the South African government sent a delegation to the USA to find out how “reservations” worked.
If you would like to participate, you should:
Get in touch using editorial africasacountry com and let us know what you want to write about.
Take a look at what was featured last year to get an idea of what we’re looking for.
Perhaps we weren't visible from space, like the Great Wall of China.
But fortunately the drone-mounted camera that filmed us in front of Cebu City’s grand Provincial Capitol building on the afternoon of January 25, 2015 hovered only a few hundred feet above us, a fraction of the Global Voices community assembled into a very respectable-looking—considering how quickly we did it—column-and-circle formation representing the 10 years of our existence.
We turned 10 in December, so the sixth Global Media Citizen Summit in January in Cebu City, Philippines, was another moment to celebrate, our only regret being that we weren’t able to do it with the entire 800-plus active members of the community present.
As the only times our virtual community gets to meet face to face, our biennial Summits are extremely important for the development of the organisation.
The 2015 Summit included four days of internal meetings, and culminated in a public conference at the Cebu Provincial Capitol on the theme of The Open Internet: Local Perspectives, Global Rights.
The proceedings opened, movingly and appropriately, with a statement read by Global Voices members calling for the release of jailed online media workers and activists.
Also announced at the Summit were the winners of the essay competition supported by Google.
We have many to thank for helping making our 2015 Summit such a success:
Our speakers, for generously sharing your expertise during the Summit sessions (see reports and videos on the Summit site).
Our attendees, who came from near and far within the Philippines, and from other parts of the world, to be part of the event.
Our international sponsors: Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Google, Open Society Foundations, Knight Foundation, Yahoo! and Automattic.
And the Summit would not have been the success it was without the tremendous support we received from our host location.
Our heartfelt gratitude to our media sponsor SunStar Publishing, and our tech sponsors Globe Telecom and Smart Communications.
To the Province of Cebu for letting us have the run of their grand Provincial Capitol Building for two whole days.
To the Philippine Department of Tourism for the warm Filipino welcome and the epic closing party at the Museo Sugbo.
And to Doris Isubal-Mongaya and her team at PRWorks for their extraordinary organisational skills and expert touches that made our time in Cebu special in so many ways—and for the gift of the drone video.
And onward and upward we go.
Photo from Papuan Voices, used with permission.
Papuan Voices is a video-production advocacy initiative that allows West Papua activists to make their own short films that tell their stories and describe their everyday struggles.
The mainstream media rarely reports anything about life in West Papua, a province of Indonesia.
When reporters do turn to the region, it's usually to focus on the political conflict between the Indonesian government and West Papua's independence movement.
Papuan Voices introduces readers to other aspects of Papuan culture and history:
These stories are not just framed around West Papua’s political struggle for independence; they are not the stories of conflict that are more often circulated.
Rather, they are the stories behind the conflict: the struggles for education, the environment, equality and dignity.
Papuan Voices is a collaboration between EngageMedia and Justice, Peace, and the Integrity of Creation.
The project works with local organizations in Jayapura and Merauke in West Papua, where local activists attended multimedia workshops, and learned to narrate West Papua's complex story through videos.
The result was a two-volume video featuring various local filmmakers and unique stories about the social, cultural, and political situation in West Papua.
The project's organizers hope “these stories will inspire others to learn and act, so that the voices of West Papua are brought to the forefront.”
Some of the videos have been screened already in other parts of Indonesia.
One of the popular films is Mutiara Dalam Noken (Pearl in the Noken), which tells the story of Dr. Mia, “a Papuan woman who has devoted her life to treating the sick and tending to the disenfranchised in very remote areas in West Papua.”

In a testimony, Wetipo lamented that violence against women is not adequately reported.
Media mostly cover political and military violence.
And yet no one looks at the violence that occurs to women.
Wetipo's video is intended to expose the poor conditions of women in Papua:
I want to show the world the lives of Papuan women.
They work so hard and receive no help from their family members.
Their husbands don’t even help them carry goods to the market.
We hope that people will see these films and be inspired to bring change to their lives.
Screen capture from "Papuan Voices."
The name Wamena itself comes from the word ‘Wam’, which means swine, and ‘Ena’, which means to tame.
Every rite of passage is symbolized by the presenting of pigs, and a family’s wealth is measured by the number of pigs they own.
Pigs are also the symbol of peace among the tribes in the central highlands.
An epidemic of pig deaths would therefore present a serious economic setback for the people of Wamena.
The video shows the close relationship between the community's pigs and people, and the social impact of an epidemic that killed large numbers of pigs:
Screen capture from "Papuan Voices."
Papuan Voices helps the public gain a better understanding of the challenges Papuans face in Indonesia.
It's also a powerful reminder that we should do more to document and share the stories of ordinary Papuans, aside from articulating their political demands for justice and equality.

The Toronto native moved to Mogadishu recently. That's where her parents are from.
But to keep in touch with her friends and family back in Canada, she started posting pictures and short videos to Instagram.
And now, more than 47,000 people and counting are following her account.
"I would post things that we didn't have in Canada, like perspiring pitchers of fruit juice, watermelon and mango, freshly squeezed lemon — the longest coastline in Africa," she says.
"Just to show that it's very much normal to be out here and to live here and to work here and to be a young women in this country."

Her photos are beautiful.
But at first glance you don't notice the pictures also say a ton, especially ones showing a paved road or lights.
"It's unbelievable the small things that I was posting that were meaningless if you were in Canada," she says.
"Why would you take a picture of a light?
That's because we actually have lights here now.
The roads are paved.
We have buildings.
They fascinated people for whatever reason."
Her followers span continents and countries.
There's her hometown crowd in Toronto.
Others in Scandinavia.
More in Nigeria.
She wants people to have a positive connotation to the words, Somalia, Mogadishu, and East Africa.
She's in it for the long haul, too.
Magadishu is her home.
"Mogadishu has always been my home in my heart.
I was not in Mogadishu for 20-some-odd years, but Mogadishu has always been, and will always be my home."

From a video created by the popular site Kharabeesh to pay tribute to the fallen pilot, on their Facebook page.
Some protesters also called for the execution of Sajda Rishawi, a failed suicide bomber behind bars in Jordan.
ISIS had demanded Rishawi's release as part of a prisoner exchange deal with Jordanian authorities for Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbeh, who was captured by ISIS militants after his plane was shot down late December, 2014 in Syria.
Jordan's Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has called for a funeral prayer in absentia to be held in all of the kingdom's mosques on February 4, while Jordan's churches tolled their bells mourning their fallen hero.
In solidarity with the pilot, divided on revenge
Tweets linking to images from the purported execution video are geo-tagged to ISIS stronghold Ar-Raqqah city, in Syria’s war-torn Aleppo province.
Jordan State TV reported that Al-Kaseasbeh was allegedly killed on January 3, but the nature of today's video was a shock to many, who refused to let ISIS propaganda cast a shadow on his memory.
An Amman-based Twitter user explains:
It's what some Jordanians expect.
They expect hard hitting response.

Jordanian Blogger and Co-founder of 7iber, Naseem Tarawnah calls for a national conversation, fearing a dark road ahead of Jordan if concerns are not addressed appropriately:

Exiled activist Iyad El-Baghdadi says that in order for change to happen, the cycle needs to be broken from within:
We'll keep going from tyranny to terrorism to foreign intervention in a closed loop until we find our voice and break the cycle from within. — Iyad El-Baghdadi (@iyad_elbaghdadi) February 3, 2015
Don't share the video
The 22-minute execution video showing Al-Kaseasbeh being burned to death, while locked in a cage, is highly stylized and edited with graphics.
The video features ISIS logos, cutaways to an interview with the pilot, news broadcasts on the pilot’s capture and images of war.
Randa Habib of AFP reported its impact on those closest to the pilot:
Devastated, some relatives fell on the floor after being informed of the execution of pilot Moaz Kasabeh.
Women collapsed. Heartbreaking — Randa HABIB (@RandaHabib) February 3, 2015
The grotesque video, in the form of screen-grabs, quickly spread in social media.
Many discouraged others from spreading those scenes in an effort to respect the victim's family and honor his memory.
Jude Qattan, a Jordanian university student called for a blackout on the video:
Everyone has the right to bear witness.
I’m a strong believer in it.
But if someone wants to see a man burned alive, google it yourself. — Andy Carvin (@acarvin) February 3, 2015 Washington DC-based Bridget Johnson asked that Al-Kaseasbeh be remembered as a proud Jordanian pilot:
Sharing a photo of Al-Kaseasbeh while in Istanbul, BBC Journalist Faisal Irshaid said that "this is how we remember him" instead:
Don't share the #ISIS photos allegedly showing the burning of Moaz Kasasbeh.
This is how we remember him. #كلنا_معاذ pic.twitter.com/ye18wmO8Zj — Faisal Irshaid (@faisalirshaid) February 3, 2015
Those who watched the video, on the other hand, were taken aback by its content, dubbing the act of burning someone to death as barbarism. Tarawneh said that it was the worst 22 minutes of his life:
Just watched video.
Worst 22min of my life.
They beat him bad & made him play the role of victim in his own dramatic execution scene. (cont) — Naseem Tarawnah (@tarawnah) February 3, 2015
Egyptian Blogger, tweeting under the title of The Big Pharaoh, equated ISIS with Nazis:

Muath, the Hero
Yet many, using the hashtag #IamMuath and #كلنا_معاذ in Arabic, expressed their solidarity with the victim's family and remembered him for serving his country as its pilot.
Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations Dina Kawar dubbed Al-Kaseasbeh as Jordan's brave hero, and a symbol of courage:
Thoughts are with the family of Moath Kassabah, who campaigned so hard for his release. #كلنا_معاذ pic.twitter.com/wByKfhC6jc — Sheera Frenkel (@sheeraf) February 3, 2015
The group's latest act prompted a discussion on the depletion of humanity. Jordanian Photographer Amer Sweidan summed the views of many in his tweet:
We have reached the bottom of human depravity. RIP, Muath. #MuathalKaseasbeh #JO #كلنا_معاذ — Amer Sweidan (@AmerSweidan) February 3, 2015
Egypt-based Journalist Mohamed Abdelfattah was rendered wordless over the news:
No words suffice for the agony felt by the death of Moath.

A day before, Jordanians stood in solidarity with Japan after ISIS purportedly released a video beheading journalist Kenji Goto.
Muath Al-Kaseabeh, was believed to be in captivity along with Goto.

Almost 1,000 people in Macedonia have signed on to participate in a second protest of part-time workers and freelancers, scheduled for February 6.
In the first protest in December 2014, several thousand people took to the streets of Skopje, marching against additional taxes and fees imposed by new government regulations, effective as of January 1, 2015.
Due to ambiguities in the new regulation and lack of coordination between government agencies in implementing the new law, payment of fees for part-time and freelance work for certain categories of workers were blocked in the last days of January.
META.mk news agency recently reported:
In the longest month of the year, freelancers who have fees higher than 9,590 denars will be left without income.
Copyright agency “Berin” said that they received a notice from Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PIOM) asking them not to pay fees higher than 9,590 denars until information on how the calculations would be made is not published on the website.
As stated in the notice, the reason for this is the lack of coordination of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, PIOM and PRO regarding the new law, which provides freelancers to also pay pension and disability insurance.
What sets this new organized protest apart from others is that it uses innovative tactics: participants are preparing to ask the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy about the law's ambiguities using Freedom of Information Act (FOI) requests.
By submitting requests for access to information as to the reasons for the delay in payments, protesters aim to show the bureaucratic inefficiency of the ministry under what many say is an absurd pretext and absurd regulations.
Come on freelancers, let's go to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and demand the answers they owe us.
Many of us didn't receive pay during January, let's ask them why!
Some of us had our contracts discontinued, let's ask them why!
They didn't ask us when they decided to change five laws last summer, let us ask them now!
Friday, February 6 at 11:00 p.m.
Ministry for Labor and Social Policy.
Use the forms enclosed.
We have the right to answers.
EVENT DETAILS
Each freelancer will submit a FOI request to the ministry and then join the rest who will stand in front of the ministry.
The submission process will take about two hours.
The template for the request is enclosed within the comments of this event .
You can choose your own questions or copy some of the list which is also enclosed.
According to Macedonia's Law on Freedom of Access to Information of Public Character, state bodies are under obligation to respond to written FOI requests within 30 days.
Those who submit the request in person orally should receive responses within five days.
More information about the FOI law is available on the website of Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information and the informative civil society portal "Right to Know."
Several hundred, if not more, FOI requests are expected to be directed at Macedonia's government through this protest.

Photo from a drone flying above the massive December 10 student protests.
The Republic of Macedonia has issued a new regulation banning the use of drones up to 500 meters from government buildings, public gatherings and protests.
The pro-government Dnevnik daily wrote a report about the new regulation, which has been in effect since January 31, but has yet to be posted online on any relevant government website.
"It is not allowed to operate unmanned aircraft under 150 meters above any inhabited are, under 50 meters of distance from any person, ship, vehicle or infrastructure," the regulation reads.
It also forbids pointing the drone towards persons, animals or gatherings of people.
According to the regulation: "It is not allowed to fly unmanned aircraft in a radius of 500 meters from building related to security, buildings of state bodies and critical masses of people, such as the buildings of Ministry of Defense and the Army of Republic of Macedonia, buildings of the Ministry of Interior, the Government, the Assembly, the residence of the President of the state, embassies, sport competitions of high risk, and big gatherings of people (protests)."
Student Plenum, the organizers of the December 10 protest claim that a drone camera operator was detained by the police.
There is no public record for how long or on what charges.
The boy with the drone has been detained in the Karposh police station.
The pressure continues but they won't stop us.
This is just the beginning!
Two years ago, tens of thousands of Macedonians took to the streets to protest against poverty and corruption in their country of two-million.
Since then, different groups of people - students, teachers, residents and workers - have come out to protest, demanding better conditions and rights.
The government has used various tactics to discourage media coverage of protests, including intimidating journalists.

Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken around the world, only a small fraction are found on the Internet.
On the platform Twitter, 85% of the tweets are written in one of just eight languages, according to one study - not exactly an accurate reflection of the planet's cultural and linguistic diversity.
Even though more and more communities are beginning to discover the possibilities of sharing their language online, much more can be done to raise awareness and highlight these efforts.
For International Mother Language Day on February 21, Rising Voices, along with our organizing partners the Living Tongues Institute, Endangered Languages Project, and Indigenous Tweets, as well as a wide range of participating partners, are coming together to launch the campaign “Tweet in Your #MotherLanguage.”
Through this online campaign, we want to recognize and encourage Internet users who are sharing their language on Twitter with a special focus on indigenous, endangered and minority languages, all of which may not be as well represented online.
It's easy to get involved:
Step 1 – Tweet in Your Mother Language
Tweet using your mother language throughout the day Share “Why is it important to use your language on the Internet?”
Tweet greetings or your favorite words/phrases in your language Tweet a translation to encourage speakers of other indigenous and minority language communities
Step 2 – Add Hashtags
Add the hashtag #MotherLanguage Add the hashtag of the language (i.e. #Lakota, #Yoruba)
Step 3 – Join the Conversation!
Find others using the #MotherLanguage hashtag and retweet them Search for the hashtag of your mother language and follow others tweeting in it Connect with other people celebrating language diversity
For more details on how to take part, take a look at the campaign website.
Why Tweet in Your #MotherLanguage?
Despite the increase in the number of languages being used online, many communities still face ongoing challenges when trying to communicate through social media.
Some languages lack a keyboard that allows users to write in their language, and many parts of the world still lack adequate connectivity, excluding them from the online conversation.
However, Internet communication has proven to be an important part of language preservation and revitalization.
Easy-to-use digital tools allow for more people to create content in their language, and the Internet for speakers of these languages to connect, regardless of geographic distances.
This campaign will highlight the work of many individuals and groups committed to using their languages on the Internet, many of whom may be considered "language digital activists" for their role in bridging this divide and encouraging a new generation of speakers.
We are fortunate to count the participation of "ambassadors" such as Rodrigo Pérez (@ISF_MX) from Mexico, who regularly tweets in the Zapotec language and Ignacio Tomichá Chuve (@MonkoxBesiro) from Bolivia, who regularly tweets in the Bésiro (Chiquitano) language, who created these videos extending an invitation to participate in the campaign.
More ambassador videos are on their way and will be added to the playlist:
Thanks to help of many people around the world, the campaign website has already been translated in more than 25 languages, including Odia, Sena, and Lezgian.
Many of these translations came from members of the Global Voices' Lingua Project, a community of volunteer translators.
With your help, we can pave the way for a more multilingual Internet where different languages are celebrated, not excluded.
All it takes is a tweet or retweet!
Five companies are said to have misappropriated funds for fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone:
Here are the 5 companies who were awarded the biggest contracts to provide goods and services to Sierra Leone’s ebola response as listed in the Ebola Funds Audit Report covering the period from May – October 2014.
The following contracts did not meet the country’s procurement laws and policies and documentation to support the awarding of these contracts were missing, and unaccounted for.
This makes it possible for fraud, waste, and misappropriation of funds to occur therefore crippling the nation’s ability to quickly respond to the crisis.

Filipinos Ask 'Where Is the President?'
"RETWEET if you think PNoy should've attended the arrival of honors instead of that Car Plant event. #NasaanAngPangulo" tweets @BobOngWords.
The hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo, which means “where is the president” in Tagalog, became the top trending topic on Twitter worldwide as Filipinos expressed their outrage at President Noynoy Aquino for skipping the arrival honors for elite policemen killed in a special operation.
Aquino graced the opening of Mitsubishi Motor Corporation’s new car factory in Laguna (province south of Manila) rather than attend the police ceremony.
The coffins carrying the remains of the dead policemen arrived at Villamor Airbase after being flown all the way from the southern Philippine town of Mamasapano, Maguindanao.
Forty-four members of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF) were killed in a botched-up counter-terror operation which became an 11th-hour pitched battle between state forces and Moro secessionist rebels operating in the Mamasapano area.
They were part of a 400-member police operation sent to capture the alleged mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings who was said to be hiding in the area.
The US government has placed a $5-million bounty on suspect Zulkifli bin Hir alias Marwan.
A series of memes ridiculing President Aquino’s absence from the arrival ceremony were widely circulated on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.
Filipino netizens recalled how President Aquino was quick to looking after big corporations and attending celebrity events while being absent in many of the big tragedies that befell the nation.
When the bodies of the MH17 crash victims arrived in The Netherlands, the Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima, and the rest of the Dutch royal family, along with government officials sat and watched and cried and mourned with nation as the coffins were brought from planes to hearses.
Nothing was more important than that ritual for the dead.
President Aquino gave a speech during the necrological services for the slain policemen a day after their coffins arrived.
But the president was again put on the spot for being late and thus putting the rites on hold to wait for his arrival.
Aquino’s speech during the service also became the butt of online jokes for being more about himself than the fallen cops.
A meme pointed out how Aquino always begins his speech in the vein of George Lucas’ Star Wars.
From the Facebook page of Jason Valenzuela.
The president’s spokesman has defended his absence from the arrival honors for the dead policemen, saying this was not part of his schedule.
He also belittled criticisms by netizens in a Palace briefing, pointing out that this was not the majority view.
School children in Arusha, Tanzania.

Tanzania is set to make a historic shift away from English and replace it with Swahili as the language of instruction in the country’s schools.
The new education system launched by President Jakaya Kikwete on February 13, 2015, in line with National Vision 2025 will also extend basic education from seven years to 11 years, provide free education at primary and education levels and abolish national examinations for primary school levers.
This appears to be one of the first times that a country in Africa will teach students at all levels in an African language instead of a foreign language.
Commenting on the language shift, Atetaulwa Ngatara, the assistant director for policy at the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, said English will still be taught as a language, but for students to learn English it's not necessary that all their subjects be taught in it.
An article about the policy shift posted on Facebook by Oliver Stegen, a Swahili speaker of German origin and a linguistic advisor at language development non-profit SIL International, elicited mixed responses.
Nancy Petruzzi Maurer joked:
"Goood mauning teacha!"
No more
Paul A Kijuu commented in Swahili saying that English has turned the educated class into robots:
On my side, Oliver Stegen I see this as the right move.
Our problem is complaining.
Education has to be given using the language that the user understands.
English does not help us apart from turning us into robots.
Our educated elites do not think independently because they do not understand what they studied.
Vera Wilhelmsen noted that not everyone needs to go to university but everyone deserves a good basic education:
I think it is important to consider what kind of basic education will benefit the most people.
It is clear that per today not very many people make it to secondary school, and even fewer graduate from it.
There is a problem when neither students not teachers are equipped to make the switch from Swahili to English in secondary school.
Of course we have to watch for the effects, but I also do think it is a good step forward.
Not everyone needs to go to university, but everyone deserves a good basic education!
However, not everyone was in support of the new education system.
Steve Nicolle pointed out one possible effect of the new policy:
I suspect one effect of this legislation will be an increase in enrollments in private schools that continue to offer tuition in English.
Keep an eye open for politicians opening new English medium schools in the near future!
Elly Gudo agreed with Steve Nicole, arguing that politicians will be the main beneficiaries of the policy:
I totally agree with Steve Nicolle.
Having lived in Tanzania, I can tell you for sure that politicians are the highest beneficiaries of this new policy.
Majority of Tanzanian middle and all upper classes who have identified with the global village will do anything to take their children to English Medium Schools.
The common man's child will then be highly disadvantaged when it comes to University admission and by extension job acquisition.
After 2 decades, the country will be highly classified.
Tanzania needs a French-type Revolution in many facets.
Opposing the policy, Muddyb Mwanaharakati said the following in Swahili:
Oliver Stegen do not make me laugh.
They have politicised the issue.
Their children go to international schools .
We, the poor ones, will continue with going to under performing and poorly equipped schools and continue with our English of ya, ya, yes no yes no.
At the same time their children are speaking English fluently.
We are still very far, Oliver, even public notices and government information in many places are still in English.
Josephat Rugemalira observed that the new policy is not as radical as people think:
You need to read carefully what the policy says: it says Swahili will be used at all levels and ALSO says English will be used at all levels (that means including primary level).
So my interpretation is that the only NEW thing made possible by such statements is that it is possible now for some people to establish Swahili medium secondary schools, and it is now official that local government authorities can convert existing primary schools to become English medium.
Reacting to the same article posted on Trending Kenya, Margaret Njeru explained that the new system does not kick out foreign or second languages but put them in their appropriate places in the learning process:
Indeed, bold and in the right direction.
Education is about development, and that development can only come through a language a people make sense of.
The world over, none of the so-called developed economies operates in a foreign language, and the use of the former colonial languages in many African countries has definitely contributed to the marginalization of the majority in the development process.
If we have to define "our" development path, then the language choice must go hand-in-hand with it.
And this does not in any way mean kicking out the foreign (or second languages), rather putting them in their appropriate place in the learning process.
Kwame Aboagye said it is time Africans used their languages:
It is about time that our African countries should speak our own dialects such as Twi, Yoruba, Swahili and Mandingo.
English wasn't our original language in the first place and we need to wake-up and go back to our principals with pride.
The shift is monumental but it comes with significant challenges, noted Christina Higgins:
What good news indeed.
Now the big test will be how to transition to Swahili in terms of materials, exams, and more.
Despite challenges, this shift is truly monumental.

As Libya was torn apart by a revolution in 2011, Haifa El-Zahawi left the country for the United States.
Now a dentist, she's looking for jobs.
But she's also devoting herself to a different project: Teaching kids back in Libya.
The volatile security situation there has kept kids out of school since October.
So if kids can't get to their classrooms, El-Zahawi thought, why not bring the classroom to them?
The Benghazi Skype School was born.
"We started with a personal account and a Skype," says El-Zahawi from New York.
She posted about her project on social media, asking Libyans if they were able to help.
Within a week, she was receiving "a really huge and positive response."
She even heard from an IT company in Libya that wanted to sponsor her project.
Of course, Internet classrooms have their own problems.
Patchy Internet connections are a major hurdle, as are the frequent power outages that Libyans face.
"We try and make live as much as we can, but due to the problems ... we try to record the lessons and post them online," El-Zahawi says.
But despite the challenges, the Benghazi Skype School has been a success so far.
"Families send us pictures of the students doing their homework," El-Zahawi says.
"They're even wearing their school uniforms."
The bigger idea behind the school, El-Zahawi says, is to bring hope to the families and kids who "really need it."
She's worried about news like the recent beheading of a group of men in Libya at the hands of ISIS, and she hopes that educating Libyan children will help stop the spread of radicalization.
"We have to educate our kids," she says, "Only by learning, we can fight."

Child labor exploitation is worsening in the Philippines.
In 2011, the Philippine National Statistics Office reported that there were 5.5 million working children in the country, 2.9 million of whom were working in hazardous industries such as mining and plantations.
The agency added that 900,000 children have stopped attending school in order to work.
These alarming numbers highlight the poor conditions experienced by many Filipino children, who lack key social services and access to welfare.
The Philippines is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international instruments that aim to promote the welfare of children.
There is also a popular initiative to build child-friendly government, especially at local level.
But these laws and programs have not succeeded in eliminating the various forms of abuse, poverty and deprivation experienced by many children.
Last month, the Ecumenical Institute for Labor Education Research (EILER) published a baseline study which confirmed the prevalence of child labor in mines and plantations in various parts of the country.
In plantation communities, about 22.5 percent of households have child workers.
In mining towns, child labor incidence was 14 percent.
Child laborers in oil palm fields often serve as fruiters, harvesters, haulers, loaders, and uprooters.
Meanwhile, child labourers in sugarcane estates work weeding, harvesting and fetching water.
In mines, child labourers usually fetch water, carry sacks of rocks, load the thick logs used to support the underground tunnels, or become errand boys for regular workers.
They are also reserve workers and 'relievers', whenever regular miners cannot come to work.
Girls in mines work in gold panning or providing services to miners such as doing their laundry or cooking meals.
EILER observed that child workers are exposed to extreme weather conditions, long working hours and a difficult environment while using substandard tools and equipment.
In plantations, trucks pick children up from their homes and bring them to makeshift tents located in nearby provinces to stay and work for periods lasting from two weeks to a month without their parents.
Since most plantations use harmful agro-chemicals, the children working on them are directly exposed to these threats.
Their counterparts working in mines, meanwhile, are handling dangerous tools and are made to work without protective equipment for long hours.
Social hazards such as the use of illegal drugs to keep children inside the tunnels awake for hours are also a regular feature of the country's mines.

A former child worker from Mindanao, Pitang, shares her experience in the plantations during a recent public forum organized by EILER:
I was ten years old when I stopped going to school.
I have lost hope that I might still go back to school, and I thought to myself that I would be a singer instead.
I usually sing to endure and forget the feeling of pain and fatigue from working in plantation.
It has been four years since I stopped schooling.
I only reached the sixth grade level and then had to stop so I could work.
Fortunately, there are groups like EILER which are campaigning for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor in the country.
One of their programs is Balik-Eskuwela (Return to School) which seeks to bring child workers back to school.
The European Union is one of EILER's partners on this project.
Child workers return to school.

A shooting in a restaurant in Bamako, capital city of Mali, claimed the lives of five people on Friday night, March, 6.
The attack took place around midnight in a restaurant called La Terrasse in Downtown Bamako and a dozen people are seriously injured.
Two suspects are in detention and are being interrogated by security forces.
A local officer reports that the two individuals were armed and hooded.
One burst into the restaurant and opened fire.
Three Malians, one French and one Belgian were killed.
A local blogger posted a video of police forces as they come to investigate the crime scene:
Global Voices contributor Marc- André Boisvert wrote on Twitter that such an attack was inevitable, given that Mali is still trying to re-establish peace in the northern region:
We all knew it would happen in #Bamako.
We all knew that the rue du #BlaBla would be a target.
Philippe Paoletta, a resident of Bamako, agrees with Marc-André:
Everyone always thought this was bound to happen at some point in #bamako.
Doesn't make it any less shocking or horrifying.
All our thoughts are with the victims of the attack.
A screenshot of a YouTube video posted by Ren TV showing an attack on an Ethiopian national.
Recent violence in Kwa-Zulu Natal and Durban is being attributed to comments made by the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who allegedly told foreigners to go home.
The attacks involved beatings, killings, and burning and looting shops and property owned by foreigners.
Five people have been killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot on Monday.
Over 1,000 foreigners have fled their homes.
Some South Africans accuse foreigners of taking away jobs, businesses, and engaging in criminal activities.
Between 2000 and 2008, at least 67 people died in xenophobic attacks.
In May 2008, a series of riots left 60 people dead.
In January this year, four people were killed in Johannesburg in similar attacks.
Using the hashtags #XenophobicSA and #AfrophobicSA South Africans and non-South Africans immediately took to Twitter to express their disgust and shock at the brutality displayed by South Africans and lack of action from the South African government.

@Mukulaa we did the same in high school, we gave 50 shillings, it's more #AfrophobicSA than #XenophobicSA ,they dislike "OTHER" Africans ... — Caroline Kere (@carolinekere) April 12, 2015
On the same point, AKA said:
During Apartheid it was these same "foreigners" that sheltered our freedom fighters ... — AKA (@akaworldwide) April 15, 2015
Some Twitter users took note of the fact that businesses owned by white immigrants were not attacked.
Tatenande from Namibia asked:
How many white foreign owned shops have been looted? #XenophobicSA — tatenande (@tatenande) April 15, 2015
However, Wadzanai Thembani, argued:

Al-Shabaab militants attacked Garissa University College in Kenya on 2 April 2015, killing at least 147 people, mostly students, and injuring 79.
More than eight times as many people were cut down by the violence than were killed during the Charlie Hebdo shooting in France, which left 17 dead, yet the Garissa tragedy hasn't prompted anywhere near the same level of international solidarity as the Paris attack.
There was a similar criticism after the Baga massacre in Nigeria, which occurred around the same time as the Charlie Hebdo killings.
While the latter saw an unprecedented show of sympathy with more than 40 heads of states participating in a rally of national unity, the former received scant coverage and attention.
In the wake of the horrific Garissa violence, Twitter users were quick to notice the lack of international reaction.
Shekhar Kapur from Mumbai, India, concluded:
Lack of International reaction to the #GarrisaAttack compared to #JeSuisCharlie shows how little the world cares about #AfricanLivesMatter — Shekhar Kapur (@shekharkapur) April 5, 2015
While Idriss Ali Nassah observed:

Switch off television news'
Observers criticised what coverage Western media did give the attack, as well.
After CNN wrongly placed Tanzania in Uganda and Nairobi in Nigeria on a map of East Africa, the Africa is a Country blog suggested that people switch off television news to make sense of the attack:
To make sense of the attack by Al Shabaab on Garissa University near Kenya’s border with Somalia (official count of fatalities are 148; others say closer to 200), you may want to switch off television news.
Especially since CNN is moving Nairobi to Nigeria and Tanzania to Uganda.
Crucial will be how these attacks will be framed in the next few hours and especially how the Kenyan state will respond (already they’ve blamed the judiciary and in the past they’ve round up Somalis despite little evidence).
Equally important is public opinion.
So, like we did at the time of the attack by Al Shabaab on the Westgate Mall in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, we’ve compiled a bunch of links, including some twitter accounts, we suggest you read or follow.
Idriss Ali Nassah stressed the need for Africa to tell its own stories:
BBC is broadcasting a debate, CNN is fixated on the Iran nuclear deal.
Africa needs own media houses to tell our stories #GarrisaAttack — Idriss Ali Nassah (@mynassah) April 2, 2015
KiGossip.Com wondered why a CNN journalist would ask a survivor if he/she was scared:
So, a CNN Journalist asked a survivor from the Garrisa Attack: 'WERE YOU SCARED'?
Absolute MADNESS...
However, a few users noted that even local media houses are not doing a good job:
Let's just agree that local media did/has done a shoddy job in covering #GarrisaAttack.

Last week a leading private university in Pakistan was forced to cancel an academic discussion on human rights in its southwestern province Balochistan “due to state intervention“.
Balochistan, Pakistan's largest, least populated and poorest province is witnessing its fifth separatist movement since 1947.
Public discussions on Balochistan's war are rare.
Nationalists think silence on Balochistan is their patriotic duty, others self-censor out of fear of Pakistan's powerful military.
But few really understand what is going on in the province, because media coverage and reporting from there is thin.
In this episode of GV Face, we break the silence on Balochistan by talking to Pakistani and Baloch activists and journalists who dare to speak out and report on human rights abuses in the province.
Theses activists and journalists walk a thin dangerous line.
Mir Mohammad Ali Talpur (@mmtalpur), a veteran human rights activists who was a part of the cancelled LUMS talk will join us.
We will also have Fahad Desmukh (@desmukh), who heads PakVoices, a news site that reports on communities in Balochistan's coastal areas, Adnan Aamir (@iadnanaamir), who heads the online publication Balochistan Point, and Ali Arqam (@aliarqam), an activist and reporter with Newsline magazine.
Backstory
Facts about the Balochistan conflict are hard to verify.
What we do know is that Baloch nationalists are seeking independence from Pakistan, and Pakistan's armed intelligence operatives are trying to suppress them, sometimes through extrajudicial “forced disappearances”.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, since 2010, the bodies of hundreds of Balochistan’s “missing people” have turned up dead bearing torture marks.
In 2013 alone, 116 bodies were found across the province, 87 of which were identified by families who accused Pakistan’s security agencies of abducting their loved ones.
The government maintains that separatists are funded by “outside forces”.
Various sectarian and Islamist militias also use the area for recruitment training to fight wars in Iran and Afghanistan, both of which border Balochistan.
These groups also launch attacks within Pakistan.
Sometimes these groups join forces in pursuit of money and resources.
The result is the people living in Balochistan have to protect themselves from several different dangerous ideologies.
Since 2001, thousands of ethnic Shia Hazaras, Balochistan's largest minority, have been killed by militant groups.
Many more have been forced to leave a province they've called home for generations.
Some Baloch nationalist groups are trying to drive all non-Baloch and the Pakistan military out of the province.
Military convoys are bombed.
Punjabi families who have lived in Balochistan for decades are now branded by some groups as unwanted “settlers”, hundreds have been killed in attacks and thousands forced to flee the violence.

On #LunesDeBlogsGV (#MondayOfBlogsOnGlobalVoices), we work to preserve blogs as an "endangered species", confronting the challenges that threaten their existence in today's digital jungle.
In a similar effort, the blogger Iván Lasso compiles stories about the future of blogging and the problems bloggers face today, when their content runs the risk of being lost in the abundance of different types and quality levels of information on the Internet.
The situation bloggers increasingly find online, Lasso argues, is approaching a "David and Goliath" situation.
Lasso says of the biggest issues for bloggers today:
In recent years, following the popularity of the Web, there is a much larger audience available.
But I suspect that much of this audience will never be yours.
Its's an audience that comes to the Net looking for simple entertainment and when they want more "hard" information, they go to the traditional mainstream media which is also on the Web.
Lasso also offers some solutions for the challenges bloggers face:
Nowadays, for an independent blog to have a certain degree of success (recognition, reputation, and views), you must become a laser beam focused on what readers want:
You want to report news?
You must give it them as soon as possible, faster than anyone.
You want to offer analysis and points of view?
You must go deeper than anyone.
You want to be instructional?
You have to explain things better than anyone.
And be more specific than anyone.

American think tank International Republican Institute (IRI) released the results of an opinion poll at the end of March, which revealed that a majority of Ugandans are generally satisfied with government performance.
Over two-thirds of respondents (69 percent) said the country is headed in the right direction.
In particular, those polled thought the government was performing well or very well in managing the economy, reducing crime and delivering basic services in terms of health, clean water, roads and education.
However, the government did register poor marks on fighting corruption, with 69 percent of respondents thinking that authorities were handling corruption badly or very badly.
The findings prompted a lively debate in social networks and on mainstream media, with many commenters questioning how so many Ugandans could think the country, where President Yoweri Museveni has ruled for nearly three decades, was headed in the right direction.
According to the 2013 Millennium Development Goals Report for Uganda, the country under Museveni has succeeded in "halving the number of people living in absolute poverty and achieving debt sustainability" – and was on track to achieve another eight of its targets.
The country registered real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.2 percent in 2013 due to strong exports and public investment, and was expected to continue growing even more in 2014 and 2015, according to African Development Bank data (although severe drought may have changed this forecast).
However, international organizations have over the years denounced human right abuses and attacks on freedom of expression in Uganda, where the regime uses ready-made laws to target activists and opposition leaders.
In October 2014, Amnesty International expressed concerns that Ugandan people were "unable to challenge their political rulers, speak freely and dispute a group of new human rights-denying laws."
Human Right Watch lists similar concerns, including the "deaths of at least 49 people during protests in 2009 and 2011."
People DO NOT grow to love and cherish dictatorships'
Readers commented widely on an analysis of the poll results published on the website of the Uganda's Monitor, a highly respected private daily.
SagInc, taking examples of dictators laundering, wrote:
The question is who requested for and subsequently paid for the research to be carried out?
You will be surprised how much money has exchanged hands and from whom.
Former dictators: Ben Ali of Tunisia, Suharto of Indonesia, Yakubu Gowan of Nigeria, Nicolae Ceaușescu of Romania all engaged in social-engineering at the height of their dictatorships to try and conceal the true state of affairs but all in vain.
History tells us that people DO NOT grow to love and cherish dictatorships but rather the opposite.
IRI says the poll was conducted in December 2014 and funded by the foreign aid arm of the United States, the US Agency for International Development.
Ugandans have reason to be skeptical.
A few days after the poll results were released, Ugandan media revealed that the government had reportedly paid a US public relations firm 614 million Ugandan shillings ($206,000, 174,000 euros) "to prop up Uganda's image" after it took a hit internationally thanks to a law that criminalized same-sex relations with life in prison in some cases.
The Anti-Homosexuality Act was struck down by the country's Constitutional Court in August 2014.

In Uganda, 65 percent of respondents in this poll support the respect of term limits, an issue that grows more relevant by the day.
In January 2015, Museveni said he is not ready to hand over power to the opposition leaders, calling them "wolves lurking to tear Uganda apart."
James commented:
Election reform and terms limit reflect the views of many.
The rest of the survey is pure fuzzy maths.
Dictatorship, murders, lies'
On the same site, commenter Jomo wondered if the respondents were informed enough:
I don't know whether the researchers took into account the fact that a large number of Ugandans (un-researched street wisdom!), both urban and rural, are largely uninformed, and depend on either here-say, or information handed down by government agents/representatives, to form their opinions.
Augustus Karube thought the poll provides useful information for political parties and wondered how their leaders are going to use it:
What really matters most, to opposition parties is, how best they can use this information, to prepare themselves, to develop strategy, to address and focus on key issues, which were sited in this quick/short poll.
They should take a particular note of respondents disagreements or dismay or disapproval, but not to read too much into it.
Never the less, do not dismiss it all together, as rubbish.
At least, it is a document, which provides a sort of overview of the political, economic and social issues, under this regime, as seen through the lives and experiences of voters, minus the untold truth.
Use it wisely.
Nothing out of it, should be taken for granted, to be or not to be the absolute truth.
What is your view?
If you were to be asked, but you were not?
Uganda's opposition parties have threatened to boycott presidential and parliamentary elections due in February 2016, arguing that the Electoral Commission is biased in favor of Museveni and his ruling party and demanding it be replaced.
An analysis by Moses Khisa, a PhD candidate in political science at Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, on Uganda's Observer criticizing the poll results as "self-deception" received a lot of comments from netizens. mungu wrote:
MK you also have to concede that your concept of 'right direction' vastly differs from that of most Ugandans.
For them all those failures of M7 regime are in fact sweet music and the right direction.
In my village they will tell you he has actually helped reduce the dust on their roads because ever since he came to power none of their children has excelled academically, got a well paying job and bought a car.
So they are not interested in a tarred road either.
A resistance to Western civilization may be?
Think about it
Francis, another reader, wrote:
What can you write home about M7/NRM/NRMO other than Dictatorship, Murders, Lies, Nepotism, Cronyism, Land grabbing, Coercion, Militarism, Robberies, Thefts, Impunity, domineering, Threats, Poverty, Rotten Education system, Tribalism, sectarianism, deception.
Among the readers of that daily newspaper, Peter was the only one to express a positive comment:
If the country is going in the right direction and Museveni achieves high marks, the logic is there is no problem.
Other problems created does not arise, they have no base.
Let those who want to come to power wait for 2016, to see Uganda continuing in aright direction.
Bambalazaabwe Ssemakula represented the opinion of many readers:
Survey or no survey, nothing is gonna change as those in leadership do not see this as credible information as long as it does not wholly suit NRM
Ugandans went to Twitter, too, to comment on the results, with hashtag #IRIUgandaPolls.
Twitter user T.Ddumba and journalism student kemigisa jacky pointed out unrealistic promises from politicians:
@tomddumba Many promises no action, many visions, no work on ground, but 69% of Ugandans believe the country is going in the right direction — kemigisa jacky (@JackyKemigisa) March 21, 2015

The nude, one of the oldest and most recurrent subjects in the art world, has led to the suspension of many Facebook accounts over the years.
One recent and widely reported example was the account of Jerry Saltz, an art critic from New York Magazine.
Last month, his account was suspended because he shared images deemed inappropriate, according to the network's terms of service.
On digital media, inappropriate often means naked.
In Saltz's case, the images were provocative and deemed to be pornographic, according to the New York Times' ArtsBeat blog.
But the same criteria has been applied to a broad range of images, from breastfeeding mothers to artists whose works reveal nipples, penises, and in particular, vaginas.
The female reproductive organ seems all but banned from social networks, even in the case of a reproduction of Gustave Courbet's famous 1866 painting The Origin of the World.
Venezuelan performance artist Erika Ordosgoitti, whose art focuses primarily on the female body, is another example of a person who has faced numerous challenges due to her publishing nude works on social media.
Among other works, Facebook has censored a portrait of her naked body five times in a row.
Screenshot of a report on pornographic content in Facebook saying that Erika's photo has been reported and therefore, deleted.
Shared by Erika Ordosgoitti.
The above text, explaining Facebook's reasons for deleting the photo reads: "We have reviewed the photo reported on the basis of nudity or pornography.
As it infringes our Terms of Service, it was removed.
Thanks for reporting.
We already told Erika Ordos that we deleted her photo, but we did not tell her who filed the complaint.
Facebook never discloses the identity of the person filling the report."
Global Voices asked Ordosgoitti to tell us about her experience with censorship on social media platforms.
From there, we started to think about how both users and system administrators facilitate censorship.
This post will be the first in a series of publications that will address the different ways of dealing with art censorship, based on the stories of Erika Ordosgoitti and other artists who have been restrained by social networks' terms of service and by social conventions.
Ordosgoitti's latest exhibition, titled Comida de moscas (Food for Flies), comments on the censorship that she has experienced and managed to document.
Warning: The photograph shown below contains graphic language.
In the first years, the page went viral online.
They continually closed my account, blocking me, and warning me, and I kept on deliberately posting my work.
I received many insults and a few death threats.

Shared image by the artist and published with permission.
Venezuelan artist Eliseo Solis Mora found himself in a similar situation not long ago.
He was blocked by Facebook for publishing a self-portrait—a frontal nude that is part of a performance art piece.
He writes:
Networks are nowdays a complex medium.
I have been banned for my photos.
On Facebook, I posted a picture of Esther Ferrer and they blocked me.
It happened again with a nude that I later dedicated to Ai Weiwei.
On Instagram, they automatically erased an image that was reported.
Complainants remain anonymous
Ordosgoitti says artists are usually blocked or censored because of complaints filed by other users with access to their accounts.
I've had about seven different Facebook accounts.
Currently I have two Facebook accounts: an official account and an alternative one, and usually one of them is blocked, so I use the other to bypass this.
The artist says the criteria for censorship are applied loosely and unequally.
She also notes that users who file unreasonable complaints face no penalties:
Facebook is the first to be blamed on this form of censorship because their policy promotes anonymous reporting.
I believe this policy is unfair, because it doesn't give me the opportunity to know who is denouncing me and why .
They thank the user who's complaining, without even knowing if the report is valid.
Although the terms of use are clear enough, the reasons for censorship are not, because nowadays (and it was not always like this) it is assumed that their intention is to exclude pornography or sexually explicit images, a policy that can thereby extend to exempting scientific and artistic images.
But how do you differentiate pornographic or vulgar images from artistic ones?
Facebook's decision to protect the identity of those who denounce images reflects an intention to keep these situations from instigating conflict between users.
But it also presents new challenges, as the artists indicate.
Solís Mora, whose body images online have also encountered censorship, considers the criteria for censoring artistic images on digital media undemocratic:
...celebrities have more freedom.
Proof of this is the famous wallpaper with Kim Kardashian showing her butt that went viral through social networks.
There is something interesting that you notice when you open Instagram: there are sexist images published everyday with thousands of 'likes' while there are works of art that are automatically blocked ...
Solís Mora recently published a warning—or rather a manifesto—on his Facebook wall:
If on this account, which is largely handled as a working tool, I show my naked body and if you, dear reader, don't like it, just turn the page ... I recommend then, that if you're my friend or virtual friend, try to understand that I am an artist with total creative freedom and that what I show here is art.
Like Ordosgoitti, Mora has been bullied and even received death threats because of his work.
For him, censorship from cultural institutions has always been something he's had to deal with, but the constraints on his online artistic freedom, he says, are growing:
The problem goes beyond reporting—the real problem is the lack of freedom.
However, I like to hear people talking about nude, even though it is the oldest subject in the art world...
Editor's note: This post started a team discussion on nude art on our page.
While some team members wanted to include the works subjected to censorship, others were reluctant.
Thus, based on these conversations, we opened the discussion in our community blog.

Twitter users show support for Garissa victims via Arnaud Seroy on twitter
On April 2, 2015, at least 147 people were killed by gunmen on the campus of Garissa University in Kenya, according to Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre (KRCS).
The center also reports that 79 people were injured and 587 people were evacuated at this stage.
The suspected mastermind of the massacre is the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militant group, which claimed responsibility for the attack.
The tragic accounts of the shooting by survivors triggered a show of solidarity worldwide.
The francophone world, still weary after the Charlie Hebdo attack, responded by showing solidarity with the Garissa victims on social networks with the hashtag #JesuisKenyan (to mirror the hashtag #JesuisCharlie).
It was the second most trending topics on Twitter in France on April 3.
Here are a few of those posts:
#JeSuisKenyan — #BPM Nouveau single (@TEAMBEOZEDZED) abril 2, 2015
147 died in the horrific #terrorist attack against education and our future.

Not enough talk in the media about the terrorist attack at the university in Kenya, are 147 dead not enough ?!
HORRIBLE #JesuisKenyan
Desireé Lozano, blogging for Voces Visibles, urges attention be paid to the extremely high rate of teenage pregnancies in Venezuela, where 25% of the pregnancies are among young people, and the lack of an appropriate public policy to counter this phenomenon and its repercussions.
Venezuelan statistics are the highest in South America and remains in first place from two years ago.
Maternal mortality is an issue directly related to teen pregnancy.
Desiree cited Venezuelan deputy Dinorah Figuera, president of the Family Committee of the Venezuelan National Assembly, who said the state's responsibility is to provide prevention:
"One consequence of teen mothers is woman lose development opportunities from a professional viewpoint, take any job in order to make some income.
For this reason, the state should mount a massive campaign to prevent teenage pregnancy," the Venezuelan deputy says.
Additionally, teenage pregnancy contributes to an already established trend, the feminization of poverty.
Furthermore, the phenomenon embodies a risk for the mother’s health, running a greater danger than the average.
In her article, the writer collects interesting expert statements on the subject providing an overview of the problem.

In terms of number of followers, Christianity is often considered a major world religion.
However, there are very few Christians in Japan, where less than 1% of the population observes the Christian faith.
In Japan, spirituality as it is understood and practiced in the West or in the Judeo-Christian tradition is not common.
For the average Japanese person, Christianity is associated mainly with getting married in a faux chapel with a faux priest.
What an awesome chapel wedding (／_;)/
Using pseudonyms, some Japanese people are going online to profess their Christian faith.
One blog post in particular has prompted dozens of comments about Christianity in Japan.
In the blog post, an anonymous blogger in Japan describes his relationship with Christianity:
I have an inferiority complex: why is it that the people around me are so successful, yet I can accomplish nothing?
So when others around me are cold to me, I feel like crying with sorrow and rage, and wonder why it is that I alone must suffer like this.
It's often said that if you want to change the world, then you must change yourself.
And it came to me in a flash.
Maybe all that I can do is accept that there's some sort of divine being who loves me.
Speaking truthfully, however, I don't believe that God exists, and so it is hard for me to say that I have faith.
But I tried assuming God exists and imagined myself loved by that kind of existence, which led me to thank him for his abundant love.
I never experienced something better than this thankfulness.
I am ashamed to say that made me realise how I had been unthankful to others.
The blogger here is conflicted; he wants to have Christian faith, but is unsure if God even exists.
However, it seems religious devotion brought the blogger bewilderment as well as joy.
Oh, but wait, isn’t this a typical pattern of involvement with a religion?
Or am I already involved with it?
I cannot expel something that has made an impression on my heart.
It is too late to think it over anyway.
The doctrine teaches me to how to live life as a human and it all sounds very decent to me.
I am inclined to listen to it, and live a spiritually rich life by coming closer, but I cannot make up my mind because it is a religion.
I guess my parents would not like me believing in religion.
Oh well, since they contradict me no matter what I do, what I do makes little difference.
I must keep this feeling secret.
Many commenters responded negatively to the post.
Commenter takass32 denied the existence of a god.
I suppose the ability to imagine or believe in a non-existent person who is honorable and tolerant of yourself is the essence of religious devotion.
honeybe, another commenter on the blog post, had a more positive opinion about having faith, but also made it a point to highlight the negative aspects of religion.
There is nothing wrong with getting involved with a religion unless you generate a negative effect on people around you, such evangelising persistently, trying to sell religious tracts, or imposing religious ideas.
Commenter ketudan considered the possibility that the blogger may be in danger of joining a cult.
Unfortunately, there are tons of cults and new religions that define themselves as "Christian", so I advise you to Google the name of that church or the religion.
I had a homework assignment once to attend a service in the past so I visited "a decent church” in the neighborhood, but what I found there was a kooky cult in which someone pretending to be a minister played the guitar in a Japanese-style room.
gohankun felt sympathy for the sheer difficulty of having a religious faith in Japan.
It sure is tiring to have a particular religion in Japan.
I have undergone hardships because I come from a Christian family and I am a Christian, too.
I still suffer sometimes.
There are times when I wish I had been born in the West.
Life would be much easier then.
Commenter nows_s came to the conclusion that religion is just another way to get through life.
Life is too much for one person to confront, so we submit to the gods, rely on a country, or become addicted to love affairs, two-dimensional characters, nicotine, or alcohol.
If that somehow enables us to live an easy life, then, what's the problem?
Kayhan reacts on its Thursday, April 23, 2015 front page to the end of Saudi airstrikes. Two prominent hardline newspapers published front pages boasting of a Saudi Arabian defeat today.
This is not a complete analysis of Iran's media landscape. Looking at a hardline news sources such as Kayhan or Vatan Emrooz in Iran can be likened to looking at Fox News in the United States.
Kayhan, a newspaper associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei's office, published their frontpage with the photo of a young Houthi Yemeni boy sitting on what seems to be rocket that remains from the Saudi Arabian airstrikes against Houthi fighters.
The title reads, "Yemen's Ansar Hezbollah humiliate Israel and America."
The Houthi's are often identified as "Yemen's Ansar Hezbollah" inside Iran.
Vatan Emrooz, another hardline newspaper tied to the Peydari Front, a political party associated with the Revolutionary Guards and Basij forces, published a front page cover depicting a framed portrait of the Saudi king fallen across the rubble of destroyed building with the exclamation, "Saudi's air dies!".
Describing someone's air as 'dying' is a popular Persian idiom for someone's defeat.
A sub-caption states, "Operation 'Hurricane Certainty' ends after 27 days of crime and infanticide without achieving any of its goals."

A group of students, mostly from Kenya, gathered in Beijing on April 18 to hold an unofficial candlelight vigil to honor the memory of the 147 people killed at Garissa University College on April 2 in northern Kenya.
While the global media, including Chinese media, initially covered the news of Garissa massacre widely, the interest rapidly faded.
As many pointed out, worldwide reactions have generally been much less noticeable in comparison to recent incidents of similarly large losses of lives.
This combined lack of visibility in the news landscape prompted Kenyan and other African students to react in Beijing, despite being thousands of kilometers away from their home countries.
Thus, on April 18 a vigil was organized in Chaoyang park in central Beijing to pay tribute to the victims and their families.
A vigil in a city that forbids protest
Beijing is home to one of the largest communities of African students, who often live in dorms on campuses and create their own tight-knit communities that cross countries of origin and language.
The idea of holding a vigil for Kenyan victims came from Brand South Africa country manager for China Tebogo Lefifi.
The site is set up to promote that country's image.
Lefifi tells Global Voices that she was inspired "by many people posting on WeChat complaining that the world is not taking a stand on the 147."
In addition, she says an email from Africa2.0 Kenya Chapter, a foundation for African initiatives, commenting on the Garissa violence reminded her that she belongs to the generation that Africa has been waiting for to implement positive change.
She is not satisfied with the Twitter-based awareness campaign #147isnotjustanumber, as she says the naming of victims is inadequate to bring about a positive outcome.
She believes it is more important to organize the African communities to voice support for their Kenya friends.
In the end, the vigil was organized by Lefifi and three other Kenyan female students.
One of them, Tina Kinuthia, explains how the idea eventually took shape:
We think African and Kenyan lives matter, this cannot fall into oblivion so we created a WeChat group where very rapidly we had about 100 people who also shared the poster we made for the vigil in their own circles.
Some even used the WeChat to send messages to be later written on paper cards and sent to the families of the victims.
But we had also a lot of people trying to sabotage the event, saying we shouldn't do something that has no official permission.
We had no money, no sponsor so we decide to organize ourselves limit to one hour to avoid problems and went for it.
While organizing a public vigil may sound like a rather simple idea to implement, there is very little tolerance for manifestations of public sentiment, even grief, in China's public space without a long and complicated process of securing official authorizations.
In this case, the students decided to be creative and design an event that would allow for their feelings and concerns to be expressed without causing unnecessary trouble for the participants.

The organizers spread the word on WeChat and through offline conversations for people to gather discreetly in Chaoyang park, one of the largest in the business part of Beijing.
Technically, gatherings of less than 500 people do not need a permit in that park, while having a vigil even in front of the Kenyan embassy or in another commercial place would require cumbersome bureaucracy.
One of the instructions shared on the WeChat group says:
The optics should look like a normal picnic in a park.
Bring some blankets.
Another participant reminded that:
There is usually a gathering of 50 yoga practitionners in the park, and they don't have a permit.
As Tina Kinuthia explains:
We wanted a gathering in an open space, because this is also where vigils were organized in Garissa and Nairobi and we wanted something spontaneous.
The event included a reading of original poetry, a candlelight mini-memorial with a minute of silence and also the creation of cards addressed to the families of the 147 victims to be mailed to Kenya later.
The vigil's impact
Around 70 African students gather near an entrance of the park to join the vigil.

Fortunately, the weather was good on April 18 in the late afternoon, as the students started to gather at one entrance of Chaoyang park to commemorate the victims.
Nearly 70 people, including students from Africa and China, sat in a remote corner of the park in front of a make-shift altar with candles.
Soon, Kenyan students began to deliver short speeches expressing grief but also concern at the future of Kenyan society.
Several speakers insisted that Kenya must overcome its differences and learn to live together despite differences in culture, ethnicity and religion.
This was followed by a reading of several poems written in English specifically for the vigil.
One poem by Amina Jarso, a Kenyan student based in Beijing, reads:
Her soul wanted to speak,
To ask of her accused crime,
She wanted to reason with him,
If only he'd give her more time.
His eyes bloodshot with anger,
Her eyes teary with fear,
He fights to silence his conscience,
She struggles not to shed a tear.
They pause and inhale together,
Two heartbeats synchronizing ,
the gun between has no pulse,
An intruder in their first meeting.
Let's listen much more closely,
To the gaps of words unsaid,
And give the 147 back their names,
So their memories won't just fade.
While another poem said:
Face down helplessly I stand,
Tears hitting hard the unarmed ground,
147 the number lingering in my mind,
Remembering they will they will not be around.
At this point of the vigil, a security officer for the park came to announce that all candles should be blown out and that the people should vacate the corner of the park.
One student tried to negotiate and buy some time to allow for the completion of the vigil, but the guard remained standing by, informing her superiors by walkie-talkie and urging everyone to leave.
Chinese perceptions of Garissa and the vigil
There were around 10 Chinese participants at the vigil, a mix of students, professors and friends of Kenya.
Tina Kinuthia explains how some got involved:
We got great support.
A person who runs a travel agency saw a posting in Jinru Feizhou, volunteered to translate the poster and shared in her community, this is how we got Chinese people coming.
One participant is a former student of Nairobi who still remembers a few words of Swahili and said she came because she felt that:
Nairobi is part of my home, and I care about Kenya.
Another Chinese participant explained that:
Most of the people around me are shocked, we even had a discussion in our class on how to avoid such things happening, and what should be the role of government, universities and students?
As one of the African organizers points out:
Chinese people seem well aware, but without a platform to mourn and support Africa, there is no place for them to express themselves.
While the WeChat group is still active, the event is also taking on a second life in the offline world.
The Africa 2.0 Kenya office will distribute the cards to the families of the victims and has requested the framed picture used for the makeshift altar to hang in their Nairobi office as a tangible sign of worldwide solidarity.
Tree of Ténéré in 1961.

The conflict with Boko Haram in southwest Niger currently monopolizes the country's news.
On March 3, Boko Haram killed 19 civilians in an attack on two villages, Kiu Keleha and Toubu Buka, situated on the Nigerien banks of Lake Chad.
In response, Nigerien armed forces have joined neighboring military groups to collaborate a counterattack on Boko Haram.
Despite these efforts, however, Niger's southwest remains isolated and vulnerable.
A new initiative by Nigerien bloggers, Mapping for Niger, is helping to increase national awareness by mapping the country’s towns, revealing a side of Niger that many living there didn't know existed.
The East: an isolated region and home to the Little Prince
Just like the Tree of Ténéré (which was for a long time the most isolated tree in the world, until it was destroyed by a negligent driver), east Niger is partially isolated from the rest of the country.
This isolation makes it more difficult to coordinate efforts to combat Boko Haram, exposing it to assaults by the rebels.
The history of the region, and more specifically the Tree of Ténéré, however, is quite unique.
The legendary Tree of Ténéré was an acacia, isolated in the middle of the desert, the only tree for 400 kilometers (250 miles) around.
It was the only tree in the world to be so isolated, serving as a landmark for the caravan routes crossing the Sahel, but also inspired many poets, who fell in love with the desert, as shown in these videos by A. Décotte:
and B. Hofmans:
On Google Maps and Google Earth, the location of the Tree of Ténéré is marked by a stunning photo of the tree overlaid with a phrase from "The Little Prince" (shared by Pierre Destruel):
"The Little Prince is Back: What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well."
Photo composition by Pierre Destruel.
P. Destruel has added the following caption to explain the image he has made between the tree and The Little Prince, quoting a passage from the book by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert.
And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on.
Wait for a time, exactly under the star.
Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is.
If this should happen, please comfort me.
Send me word that he has come back.
The Project— Mapping for Niger
This project is being run collectively by the geography department of the Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey, its students, Open Street Map, and Rising Voices.
The project trains students and the rest of the team in the skills they need to participate in a collaborative open-source mapping project.
Armed with these news skills in mapping and citizen journalism, participants have been going out into the surrounding rural villages to map key sites, such as schools, roads, and hospitals.
They have also used their skills to link the maps created directly with the needs of the local communities.
On International Women’s Day, for example, the contribution of female participants was recognised and celebrated at a training workshop with the organisations ITECH CENTER, Fada Tech, and Femmes & Tic Niger (an association created by Fatima Alher, a member of the Mapping for Niger project):
OpenStreetMap Mapping workshop with Femmes & TIC Niger (created by Fatima Alher), via Mapping for Niger on Facebook.
So far, the project has helped improve and enrich maps of Madaoua, Niamey, Dosso, Zinder, Kolmane, and Guidan Toudo.
The project will also expand gradually to other regions of Niger.
Other organisations, such as Search for Common Ground, will collaborate with these initiatives to strengthen the communities in vulnerable areas.
Although this is still an informal collaboration, Search for Common Ground is involved in several other important projects, including efforts to strengthen social cohesion and advance the peace process, particularly among young people of Zinder:
We succeeded in training 172 youth, including more than 40 young women.
Participants came from various socioeconomic backgrounds, ranging from university students to illiterate gang members, and were of different ethnicities, ages, and institutional affiliations.
Another 806 young people, 10% of them women, shared their thoughts on new concepts and discovered how to apply them in their own context.
After our training, a reformed gang leader requested an extra restitution session for the students of a vocational school in Zinder.

A Malaysian cartoonist facing several sedition charges has vowed to keep on using his pen to criticize government corruption, human rights violations, and abuses of power.
Zulkiflee Sm Anwar Ulhaque, more popularly known as Zunar in Malaysia, is a political cartoonist who has been arrested twice for alleged violations of the Sedition Act, a colonial-era law.
Zunar, who was arrested earlier this month, was charged with nine counts of sedition.
If found guilty, he can be detained for a maximum of 43 years.
He is currently out on bail.
Zunar has been critical of the ruling coalition which has been in power since the 1950s.
Because of his activism, five of his cartoon compilations are banned in Malaysia.
Even those who print, distribute, and sell these books are harassed by the government.
Instead of backing down, Zunar refuses to be intimidated.
He once said that “as the regime sharpens their iron fists, my pen gets sharper!”
He added:
Talent is not a gift, but a responsibility.
So I will use it as a tool to convey people’s voice through art and to push for total reform for a better Malaysia.
I will not keep quiet.
How can I be neutral, even my pen has a stand!
From the Facebook page of Zunar Kartunis
Asked about his technique, Zunar explained that it’s important for an artist to 'take a stand' and convey the right message to the reading public:
My ideas are based on current issues, especially politics.
When an issue arises, the first step is to understand the issue from different sources and perspectives.
After gathering all information, the second step is to take a stand on the issue.
This is actually an important step because it will determine the direction of my cartoons.
The right stand will convey the right message.
I do not want to convey the wrong message just to get people laughing.
This cartoon was widely shared after Zunar was arrested this month.
Zunar said he will continue to draw even if he is detained:

This cartoon was used as a basis to charge Zunar with sedition.
Najib Razak is the incumbent Prime Minister who is accused by jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim of using the courts to silence critics.
Anwar, who is serving a five year sentence for sodomy, says his case was politically motivated.

Human rights group Suaram defended Zunar and lambasted the government for arresting its critics:
Persecuting and prosecuting people for dissenting or for criticising the government goes against the very fundamental principle of democracy and accountability of government.
Democracy demands the active participation of citizens in the political process, and that includes the right to criticise, and the right to decide the government of the day.
Below are some of Zunar’s cartoons posted on Twitter.
Zunar has been critical of the new taxes (GST) imposed by the government and what he sees as continuing corruption in high places.
He showed how the GST will hurt the ordinary rakyat (people):

Egypt sentenced its first democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi to 20 years in prison today, found "guilty of intimidation and violence" towards protestors in 2012.
He was acquitted of charges related to killing protestors.
Morsi, who is a Muslim Brotherhood member, was the president of Egypt for one year after the revolution, which overthrew Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for more than 30 years.
Morsi's reign was cut short in July 2013, following massive protests calling for his ouster.
Then, the Egyptian Army took command, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces and Minister of Defence General Abdul Fattah El Sisi, who was later on elected as the new president of Egypt.
Cairo-based journalist Bel Trew tweeted court proceedings:
She adds:
For The Big Pharaoh, Morsi's faith should be a lesson for those in power today.
He notes:
2 yrs ago, MB was ruling, sent cadets to attack sit-in.
He adds:
And continues:
Tamer El-Ghobashy casts doubt on Egypt's judiciary.
He says:
Egypt's judiciary has made the facts of cases irrelevant.
And the plot is not lost on Tweet Palestine, who draws parallels:
This is not all for Morsi, as the trial continues.
Journalist Hafsa Halawa tweets:
Stay tuned as the Morsi saga continues in Egyptian courts.
This is Uganda (ThisIs256) is a platform of talented writers from Uganda who are determined to write positive stories about their country, banishing stories about poverty porn, hunger, Ebola, and tribalism, among others.
They seek to represent an authentic, reflective, honest, and objectively balanced study about Uganda that you will never find anywhere else in mainstream western media.
Their latest story is about Victor Ochen, a former internally displaced person who was nominated by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a Quaker social justice organisation, for the Nobel Peace Prize.
In the past, AFSC nominated Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King Jr., and US President Jimmy Carter, who all became winners.
The organisation unsuccessfully nominated Mahatma Gandhi, who never won the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948.
Ochen, 33, founded the African Youth Initiative Network, based in Lira, Uganda, in 2005, which works in medical rehabilitation of victims of burnings, mutilations of all kinds, rape, and psychological torture as well as promotes youth leadership.
It has grown to become an international network of medical professionals who help victims rebuild their homes and livelihoods.
According to This is Uganda:
What Victor did out of sheer compassion added him to this prestigious list.
As a teenager in Abia camp that was home of over 40,000 people, he formed a peace club with his peers in the camp.
This initiative angered the elders “Why are you talking about peace that you have never seen?”
He was enterprising; he risked his life to burn charcoal to raise his school fees.
Then later he joined secondary school and could barely afford time to do his charcoal business so he became a cobbler, he used to repair shoes of kids at school.
One day he landed a big job of mending the shoes of the school football team, unfortunately that money was stolen.
His hard work and favor from the teachers saw him through high school.
Victor’s heart was home even when he worked with straight talk foundation in Kampala, interacting with the people in the field made him realize that the people of northern Uganda wanted more than hand outs but wanted and deserved more.
That is when he left his job and started the African youth initiative Network.
This initiative mobilizes communities especially the youth to pursue peace and human rights, reconciliation.
They offer psychosocial support to the former victims of conflict, most of who suffer severe emotional pain and struggle with forgiveness, they have also supported over 5000 people with reconstructive surgeries especially the women whose lips were cut off, the initiative also supports income generating activities, have formed 100 peace clubs in schools and universities in northern Uganda and over 6000 young people have gone through the peace building and transitional justice programme.
Japanese artist Megumi Igarashi, nicknamed "The Vagina Artist" by the Western media, says there's nothing obscene about artwork based on her genitalia.
(Megumi Igarashi)'s first court appearance, declares herself not guilty of obscenity charges. （´-`）.｡oO (I'm also so glad the courtroom artist was able to portray her so well. ー(^o^)
Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested Igarashi in July 2014 for allegedly emailing crowd-funders of her art project links to a webpage, where they could download 3D data that could be used to create vulva-shaped kayaks based on the shape of her genitals.
Igarashi was again arrested several months later for displaying another artwork based on the shape of her genitalia in a Tokyo sex shop—a clear case of police harassment, according to her lawyer.
For several months prior to her arrest in July 2014, Igarashi, who also goes by the pseudonym 'Rokudenashiko" ( ろくでなし子 or "good-for-nothing girl"), had gained notoriety for creating and displaying a variety of works of art based on the shape of her genitals.
Megumi Igarashi, aka Rokudenaishiko, is the Tokyo artist accused of obscenity.
Let's take a look at a few samples of her artwork.
In Japan, media portraying either the male or female genitalia are illegal under Article 175 of the penal code.
The prohibition dates back to the Meiji Period, when Japan adopted Western practices and institutions in the latter half of the 19th Century.
Interestingly, Article 175 offers no clear guidance to police or courts about what constitutes obscenity in these cases:
...There is not a clause in this article, which defines the term "obscenity" and "neither government administrators nor the courts were legally compelled to specify what constituted "obscene material".
It is little wonder that multiple interpretations have been given to this article with regards to its application.
If we consider visual material such as manga or cinema, the law has interpreted the term obscenity in this article as the exposure of pubic hair, the adult genitals and the sexual act.
Thus, if this should happen the exposed parts in any kind of visual material should be hidden with what in Japan is called bokashi (blurring or fogging) or with a digital mosaic.
This extremely vague definition of obscenity has created numerous inconsistencies in court decisions, which are central to the current debate on freedom of speech in Japan.
Japanese culture also has a strong taboo about discussing or even acknowledging vaginas (although Holland-based Metroplis TV, the publisher of the informative clip below, has no problem with using the term "Pussy Boat" to describe Igarashi's vulva-shaped kayak):
If convicted, Igarashi faces up to two years in jail and fines of up to 2.5 million yen (US $20,900).

During the same parliament session three other bills were presented too: Access to Information (ATI), Media Services, and a Statistics Bill.
However, the cyber crime bill is new, and the version posted online (not the final version) caused debate instantly.
As in many other countries, online fraud and financial scams indeed are a persistent threat in Tanzania.
But the bill covers much more than this.
And it has now passed the parliament despite criticism from opposition politicians, social media practitioners and human rights activists.
Leading opponents of the legislation from civil society say they will take the government to court if the president signs the bill into law.
The Citizen, a local newspaper, has identified several of the most concerning areas of the bill for Internet users.
In an analysis for CIPESA, a regional ICT policy group, Ugandan journalist and analyst Juliet Nanfuka writes that the primary aim of cyber crime bill should be to safeguard citizens' rights on the Internet.
Instead, she says, it shows an "overt disregard for press freedom and freedom of expression, excessive powers to police, and protections afforded to ordinary citizens."
The bill outlaws the publication of "misleading, deceptive or false" information, a measure that Nanfuka noted presents a clear threat to free and open expression online.
It gives police wide ranging ability to search the homes of suspected violators of the law, seize their electronic hardware, and demand their data from online service providers.
Aidan Eyakuze and Ben Taylor, both of whom work for the independent East African initiative Twaweza, argued that the bill gives too much power to police without meaningful oversight:
...the bill gives even very junior police officers the power to search and/or seize any computer equipment or data, including the content of messages, with no meaningful justification required or oversight provided.
This includes demanding information from internet service providers and mobile phone networks.
Tanzanian blogger Thinklessactmore noted that police could use the law to "harass online activists in the name of suspicion of cyber bullying without due of the law."
Twitter user Sultan Rajab, a tax and financial consultant in Tanzania, said he thought well of the bill, but was concerned about the powers it bestows upon police:
@JMakamba it is a good bill/law.
I am worried about the power given to our police.
Ignorant & low income earners might suffer. — Sultan Rajab (@SultanKipupwe) April 1, 2015
The bill also criminalizes the sending of information "without prior solicitation" by electronic means.
While this section is intended to address spam and phishing attacks, it could be interpreted quite broadly.
Maria Sarungi Tsehai, a communications expert and founder of the organisation Change Tanzania, asked:
"@jpb4rretto: @MariaSTsehai How is any message transmitted with solicitation?
Call me and ask me to write you and email? #CyberCrimeBill" — Maria Sarungi Tsehai (@MariaSTsehai) April 2, 2015
But unlike the Cyber Crime Bill, none of these three bills have been shared with the public in their current versions.
Commenters on social media and journalists are sharing opinions on why they think the Tanzanian government has an interest in keeping these bills from the public, while at the same time rushing the process.
Some question if it is due to the fact that Tanzania is preparing for elections in late October 2015.
Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), over the past few years increasingly has confronted the growing influence of opposition parties.
At the same time, journalists and media have also faced threats and violence.
Writing on Washington Post blog, Keith Weghorst and Ruth Carlitz argue that fast-tracking the bills is "consistent with the behavior of a ruling party willing to hold onto power at all costs." They write, "The more that the government can weaken the legitimacy of opposition criticism—by monopolizing the flow of public information—the better they are positioned to prevent scandals and poor performance from hurting them at the polls."
Thinklessandactmore was impressed that Tanzania has realized the need to regulate the Internet use, but said the bill was rushed into parliament:
It’s important to have law that would regulate online activities and the use of internet but it should be done in a right way.
There is no hurry in having such law; there was none in the past 53 years of independence.
If it takes one or two years to have a better cyber-crime law be it so, let’s conduct enough research on the issues; collect different opinions about the bill before it is present in the parliament.

He had probably thought it would be easy to steal some shampoo from the owner of a store in Peru, but things went bad for this thief.
The man and his accomplice entered a store in the Peruvian city of Huancayo, saying they were buying some liquor, and when the owner was distracted, they took a box of shampoo.
The owner noticed what had happened and asked for help from security guards.
To prevent the situation from escalating, one of the thieves knelt down to ask for forgiveness.
The owner, a woman, was so moved by this reaction that she didn't press charges.
The accomplice also benefited, although he didn't ask for forgiveness.
The guy claimed he will never again commit an act like this one.
The blog Noticias Huancayo Perú summed it up:
He knelt down and begged the old lady for forgiveness, claiming it would be the last time he'd steal.
The affected lady while accepting the thief's pleas, refused to report the incident.
User KDNA15TV posted a video with the events:

This article and radio report by Andrea Crossan for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on April 7, 2015, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
The West African country of Liberia has been devastated over the past year by an Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands of people.
And for those in hospitals suffering, all they see are masks and robot-looking suits of doctors and nurses caring for them.
The medics must wear those protective suits to stop them from coming in contact with a patient.
But some humanity is stripped away with the intimidating get-up.
Until now.
Los Angeles-based artist Mary Beth Heffernan saw the Ebola suits on news reports.
She thought about how isolating it was for the patients.
And she came up with the idea of taking photos of health workers that could be attached to their protective clothing.
In late February, Heffernan travelled to Monrovia, Liberia to do just that.
She brought cameras, six printers, ink cartridges and sticky labels to print the photos on.

“I invited the healthcare workers to offer the expression that the wished they could have given their patient if they weren’t covered up with these suits,” says Heffernan.
"Most chose to smile warmly for the camera and that is what the patients see in this head shot photograph.”
Health workers Morris Zolu, Kaifouba Kamara, and Joseph Walatee wearing their portraits.

The portraits were attached to the safety suits and then thrown out at the end of each work day.
“One of the challenges was that photographs are kind of hard to come by in Liberia and they are expensive to print.”
So Heffernan gave staff members a copy of their portrait to keep.

Heffernan says that it’s better than just having health workers wear name tags.
“An ID is tiny, it’s laminated, and it’s also about authority.
It’s about differentiating classes of people with power, and what I wanted was to make the patient more powerful.”

And for the workers, it helped them to better relate to each other and their patients.
Health care workers told Heffernan, "we no longer look like scary ninjas.”

If all works out, perhaps the medics won't have to wear the photographs on their clothing much longer.
The Ebola outbreak has been tapering in recent months and there are hopes that the country could soon be declared free of the disease.

Pedro Muller reflects on the lapse of the school system, an institution he says meant for a different historical context.
In this regard, he notes the importance of two similar, but at the same time different, concepts: "to study" and "to be educated":
To be educated goes beyond memorizing a couple of names and forgetting them the next day.
It is about having an inquisitive mind and wondering about what hides behind the obvious, it is to acquire skills, to exercise your lateral thinking, a divergent thinking that many call "thinking outside of the box".
To be educated is also about learning to be creative and innovative.
We learn better in groups; it is part of our nature to discuss, think and reflect on a specific topic and draw conclusions.
It is said that the best way to became educated is to learn.
Muller invites readers to watch the following English-language video, wherein Logan LaPlante talks about the concept of ​​"hacking education" or "hackschooling", which refers to the process of learning as a group experience, based on trial and error and, above all, the importance of creativity.

Taking the cue from a Der Spiegel report on the mastermind behind the structure of ISIS, Palestinian blogger Iyad El-Baghdadi tweets:
Der Spiegel names Iraqi Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, killed in Tal Rifaat in Syria in January 2014, as the "architect" of the ISIS, an Al Qaeda off-shoot which has come to control larges swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, leaving terror, death and destruction in its trail.
It says al-Khlifawi was a former colonel in the intelligence service of Saddam Hussein's air defense force.

The Rescue Brigade Topos México Tlatelolco has started a fundraising campaign to be able to join rescue efforts there after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook Nepal last Saturday, leaving more than 4,000 people death and 7,000 injured.
The group was born when volunteers spontaneously showed up to help in the aftermath of 1985 Mexico City earthquake.
The group was formally organized as a civil association in February 1986 and for more than three decades, they have assisted rescue and recovery efforts in the Mexican states of Tabasco, Chiapas, Oaxaca, State of Mexico, Veracruz and Mexico City, and in countries all over the world including Haiti, Indonesia, El Salvador and Chile.
Topos México doesn't receive any payment for their work since it is entirely based on volunteers.
Most of the time, local authorities or Mexico's federal government cover their travel expenses and the countries they go give them visas and access to the disaster zones.
The following video shows a summary of the Topos' work.

On March 5, 2015, the European Union Court of Justice ruled that the reduced value-added tax (VAT) established for printed books should not apply to digital books, considering everything distributed or delivered electronically or via Internet as a service.
Amalia Lopez questions the resolution on the Blog Sinerrata Editores:
What struck me was that they used the format as an argument to reinforce their decision, which maybe could have made sense at some point in the past, but nowadays, I find it completely absurd.
It is true, an e-book is a file and not an object, but does it make a book less of a book if I keep it on my computer or my e-reader rather than on the book shelf?
When I read a digital book, is the cultural experience lesser than when a read the book on paper?
That is to say, what this court has ruled (or, at least, that's my interpretation) is that what makes a book a cultural product, thus deserving reduced tax (and a lower cost to its consumers), is the paper on which is printed.

On April 25, 2014, nine bloggers and journalists were arrested in Ethiopia.
They have been behind bars ever since and have yet to stand trial.
To mark the one-year anniversary of the arrest and detention of the Zone9 bloggers and associated journalists, our community crowd-sourced this video to support our jailed colleagues.
This collage features messages and wishes from Mexico, Chile, the US, Cuba, Croatia, Colombia, Kenya, Switzerland, Iran, Syria, France, Azerbaijan and of course, Ethiopia.
Watch, share, and say it with us: #FreeZone9Bloggers!

A screenshot from independent newspaper Daily Nation (@DailyNation) featuring photos of Garissa shooting victims, shared on Twitter.
The international and local media coverage of the Garissa University College shootings, which saw at least 147 people killed by Al-Shabaab militia, has been heavily criticised.
While names of the attackers have been widely published, the victims have often been reduced to a number: 147.
In response, Kenyans online have made efforts to give names and faces to the victims of the barbaric violence.
Blogging at the Africa is a Country blog, Kenyan author Binyavanga Wainaina said Kenya is "not a nation if we can’t properly memorialize each and every citizen we lose”:
I want to see the names ages and photographs of those who died in Mpeketoni.
Those killed during PEV.
Stories.
Forgetting is not good.
It is in these acts, our public commons reawaken.
The politics of saying we are not ready to face ourselves, the fullness of our pain, is the same politics that allows us to ignore it when a Kenyan strips the institution they are given to run, strips it dry, dry, and returns like a zombie, a plastic rubber-band zombie in some new form, to govern somewhere else again.
I want to see three million Nairobians flood the streets to cry, and sing, and hug because our children have been killed.
I want to stop feeling that we live inside mostly the private.
I want never to hear the word self-empowerment again.
On Twitter, Ory Okolloh Mwangi explained why it is important in African culture to name the victims:
Naming and naming ceremonies a big deal in African culture.
Signifies life past, present, future.
And so we will name them one by one. — Ory Okolloh Mwangi (@kenyanpundit) April 5, 2015
In order to humanise the victims, some Twitter users have tweeted the hashtag #147notjustanumber to share their names and photos:
RIP Elizabeth Nyangarora.

The United States of America formally dropped Cuba from its state sponsors of terrorism list Friday, a designation reserved for nations that, according to the US government, repeatedly provide support for international acts of premeditated, politically motivated violence against non-combatants.
According to the US State Department:
In December 2014, the President instructed the Secretary of State to immediately launch a review of Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, and provide a report to him within six months regarding Cuba’s support for international terrorism.
On April 8, 2015, the Secretary of State completed that review and recommended to the President that Cuba no longer be designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.
Accordingly, on April 14, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report indicating the Administration’s intent to rescind Cuba’s State Sponsor of Terrorism designation, including the certification that Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six-months; and that Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.
The 45-day Congressional pre-notification period has expired, and the Secretary of State has made the final decision to rescind Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, effective today, May 29, 2015.
The rescission of Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for rescission.
While the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba’s policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation.
On Global Voices Checkdesk, a collaboration project between Meedan Checkdesk, an online news verification tool, and Global Voices Online, Joey Ayoub charts the initial reactions on the bombing of a second Shia mosque in Dammam, in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, for the second Friday in a row.
Three people were killed in the suicide bombing, which the ISIS Saudi branch Walayat Najd, has claimed responsibility for, and some 10 people have been injured.
On May 22, a suicide bomber detonated himself in a busy mosque in Al Qadih, in Qatif, killing at least 21 people, including a child, and injuring 120, in the worst attack on Saudi Arabia in a decade.
In November, eight people were killed in Al Ahsa, also in the Eastern province, when gunmen attacked a Shia community centre, where a religious ceremony was taking place.
Unconfirmed reports say that Saudi coalition forces, which have been bombing Yemen for more than two months have targeted the Marib Dam, one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world.
On Twitter, Hussain Albukhaiti claims:
In a follow up tweet, Albukhaiti posts a photograph of ruins, of what he describes as the dam, which dates back to the 8th century BC and is considered the oldest known dam in the world:
The size of the destruction of Yemeni infrastructure and history is still unaccounted for.

Residents of the city of Medellín, Colombia, are asking themselves if the metro is the place to talk about abortion, stemming from an ad by the #ladecisiónestuya (the decision is yours) campaign that's running in the public transit system's cars, as shared by user Jaime Andrés (@JAIM3_ANDR3S): The Decision Is Yours pic.twitter.com/Nbaq2zJHXn — Jaime Andrés (@JAIM3_ANDR3S) May 26, 2015
The campaign is being spearheaded by a non-profit organization offering sexual and reproductive healthcare services, carrying the message: "398,000 abortions should not be illegal."
Under the hashtag #Abortonoesculturametro (Abortion Is Not Metro Culture) referring to the set of rules governing Medellín's Metro called "Cultura Metro" (Metro Culture), people have been sharing their opinions for and against abortion, in the same way that the mass transit system installations' cars are used on a daily basis to post messages using other graphic material.
Don Osborne discusses a news feature on the Olivet Nazarene University website showing a map of "The Second Most Spoken Languages Around the World."
He points out key problems from the map:
The first issue is assuming that "The most spoken language in any country is often obvious; usually, it’s the official language of the country."
In Africa this often is not the case, if by "most spoken" one counts number of speakers.
An example is Mali, whose linguistic profile was explored on this blog in discussing the long-tail of languages - Bambara is certainly more used than the official French.
Official language is a category that doesn't lend itself to ranking use of languages in Africa, beyond the (admittedly important) context of official use and its spillover to popular use.
In the case of two countries at least, this runs into additional problems:
•South Africa has 11 official languages (the Olivet site incorrectly lists only one of them - Zulu - as official).
So one of the official languages will be second most spoken.
Perhaps that is Xhosa as indicated, but the model focusing on official languages hasn't worked here.
•Rwanda has three official languages (Kinyarwanda, French, and English), and Central African Republic two (Sango and French).
Since the site doesn't consider these official languages in discussing second most widely spoken, it is reduced to stating that Swahili is "second" most used in Rwanda, and that indigenous languages are used in CAR - which doesn't tell us much.

Pregnant 11-year-old who refused to abort creates controversy.
We wrote recently about about a 10-year-old pregnant girl from Paraguay who was allegedly raped by her stepfather and who was unable to have an abortion because of legal limitations in the country.
Now, in Uruguay, where abortion is legal in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the case of a pregnant 11-year-old who refused to have one has shocked the country.
This girl, who has been said to have an intellectual disability, was raped by the 41-year-old grandfather of her half-sister.
This man is now in custody and will be prosecuted for rape, Uruguayan officials told Agence France-Presse.
Family members, doctors, social organizations, and the media have encouraged the girl to terminate the pregnancy.
They have even pressured the government to try and force her to go through with it, according to Pangea Today.
The response was, however, not favorable to them:
“There is no risk for the life of the child or baby, so we cannot force her to have an abortion,” the director of INAU, Monica Silva, said.
Atnaf Berhane, member of the Zone 9 Bloggers, was jailed for blogging about human right violations in Ethiopia.

In April 2014, nine bloggers and journalists were arrested in Ethiopia.
Several of these men and women had worked with Zone9, a collective blog that covered social and political issues in Ethiopia and promoted human rights and government accountability.
And four of them were Global Voices authors.
They have been behind bars ever since, their trial postponed time and again.
Last week, we featured our debut post from a series - "They Have Names" - that hopes to highlight the individual bloggers who are currently in jail.
We wish to humanize them, to tell their particular and peculiar stories.
This week, Ghanaian author, Kofi Yeboah, writes about the youngest of the Zone9ers, Atnaf Berahane.
Atnaf Berahane, 26 years old, is the youngest of the Zone9 bloggers.
He was arrested in Ethiopia on April 25 and 26, 2014 alongside Abel Wabela, Befeqadu Hailu, Mahlet Fantahun, Zelalem Kibret, and Natnael Feleke (all members of the Zone 9 blogging collective) and journalists Asmamaw Hailegeorgis, Tesfalem Waldyes and Edom Kassaye.
Ethiopia is a country where freedom of expression is repressed by the government.
There is strict media regulation in the country, especially when it comes to discussions of politics and human rights.
As a result, citizens read news mostly from the Internet.
Atnaf's passion for civic engagement and interest in disseminating information to citizens to understand what the constitution says about their right and freedom led him to co-found the Zone9 Blog: his passion for human rights activism ignited the interest to co-found the organisation.
But his passion for human rights and freedoms left him in chains.
In real life, Atnaf is an ICT specialist who works with Addis Ababa city administration at Bole sub-city.
The trailtrackerblog, where supporters post regular updates about the case and the bloggers' condition, describes him as a young Ethiopian who is "known for his use of Twitter handle for hyper local updates."
Atnaf also runs his own blog and is a digital security expert.
The sad reality of the muffled aspirations of one so young as Atnaf is best captured by this post:
Is it the “Federal Republic of Ethiopia” or the “Republic of Dystopia” (police state)?
Has Ethiopia crossed into the Twilight Zone, the Fifth Dimension?...
Ethiopia today might as well be called the “Republic of Dystopia”.
Young men and women barely in their 20s are arrested and jailed for “terrorism” merely for blogging on Facebook and speaking their minds on other social media.
Atnaf, together with other incarcerated Zone 9 bloggers, deserve praise and not a jail sentence.
It is not only the future of Atnaf that is on trial but that of every aspiring young man/woman who dares take a repressive government to task on free speech.
Playwright Aizzah Fatima plays a character she calls a "hijabi feminist."

Published with PRI's permission
This article and radio report by Joyce Hackel for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on May 28, 2015, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Aizzah Fatima used to worry that the title of her one-woman play, "Dirty Paki Lingerie," would offend her fellow South Asians.
But after nearly five years of staging the production from Toronto to Turkmenistan, the Pakistani American actress is less concerned when the ethnic slur raises eyebrows.
"It was a big challenge when I first started doing this play to get the Muslim American community to support it," she says.
"That's really changed."
The monologues in 'Lingerie' explore issues of identity, sexuality and religion from the perspective of six Pakistani Americans.
In recent weeks, Fatima and director Erica Gould have taken the production to Luton, Bradford, Glasgow and London where they've engaged with local Muslim communities through "talk-backs" after the show.
"I've had theaters book the show, and then drop it because they were worried," she says.
"We were in Bradford, which I think is one of the poorest cities and the largest concentrations of Pakistani people in the UK, and there were definitely people in the audience who had an issue with it.
And they were vocal about it, yet they still came."
The phrase "Paki" is especially derogatory in Britain, where it was first used by tabloids in the 1960s to refer to all South Asians, including Indians, Afghans and Bangladeshis.
Fatima says she decided to write the show to offer a more nuanced view of the Pakistani-American experience in the US, and because she was frustrated by being told she wasn't "trashy enough" to portray the roles typically offered to South Asian Muslim actresses.
"There was a human side to this experience of being a Muslim American woman that was completely missing in the media, completely missing in the types of characters we see in film, TV, theater," she says.
"I wanted to portray Muslim women, especially women who cover their hair, the way I know them to be, as activists and feminists and very outspoken go-getters."
Fatima says the South Asian stereotypes will be shattered in coming decades.
"I really hope in my lifetime, 30 years down the road, we're able to look back at this time and say, 'Hey, now we're beyond it,'" she says.
"We've moved on."
"Who will be next?"
Sketch of deceased Bangladesh bloggers by MadhuMondol.
The Global Voices community calls for international attention to the alarming situation of bloggers in Bangladesh.
Bloggers have been killed, and many more have been attacked, subjected to death threats and ostracized by religious hardliners for their writing.
This year alone, three bloggers have been assassinated in public.
The names of these bloggers and others under threat appeared on a list of 84 people submitted to a special government committee by a group of conservative Muslim clerics who accused the bloggers of “atheism” and writing against Islam.
Government officials responded by blocking critical websites and making arrests, of bloggers and leaders from the religious right, at the height of #shahbag protests in 2013.
Some media outlets, including prominent right-wing blogs, have even propagated the idea that all bloggers are atheists who “hurt the feelings” of religious Bangladeshis.
Atheists have the same rights as other citizens in Bangladesh.
Under national law, any person who has a “deliberate” or “malicious” intention of “hurting religious sentiments” can be prosecuted.
But vigilante violence and murder for alleged insults is a horrendous response and egregious violation of the laws of Bangladesh.
Despite this, Bangladesh’s secular government has done little to discourage the attacks or bring the killers to justice.
These bloggers were neither advocating nor perpetrating such violence.
They were writing about the complex, often tendentious political climate in Bangladesh and the importance of upholding human rights.
They were exercising their right to free expression, enshrined by their nation’s constitution and international human rights doctrine to which Bangladesh is party.
Global Voices is a community bloggers, activists, writers, and translators from 137 countries.
The universal human right to free expression is fundamental to our mission.
We tell underreported stories from around the world and defend the rights of everyone to speak freely and without fear.
Among those the 84 individuals on this list are friends and collaborators of the Global Voices community.
There are also bloggers and online activists who are not in the list, but are in peril because of their writing and activism.
We are deeply concerned for the safety of Bangladeshi bloggers both in and outside the country.
We condemn the murders of bloggers Ananta Bijoy Das, Ahmed Rajib Haider, Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy and call on authorities to ensure that those responsible for these killings are brought to justice.
And we ask our allies in the international human rights community to join us in our call, and in helping to ensure safety for those in peril.
Celebration and jubilation near Presidential offices in Bujumbura after the overthrow of Nkurunziza. #BurundiCoup pic.twitter.com/WhJzXKfS69 — Robert ALAI (@RobertAlai) May 13, 2015
Following incumbent Burundi President Nkurunziza's candidacy for a third term, General Godefroid Niyombare announced that he has dismissed the current administration and that he is taking over until further notice.
The government denies such coup has taken place and calls it a "farce".
The situation is evidently still very fluid in Burundi, but here is summary of what is known and what is still not clear in Bujumbura, the capital from Penelope Starr (via UN Dispatch blog):
President Nkurunziza was not in the country when the coup was announced (but no one knows whether he is back yet): The president was attending a Summit of Eastern African Nations when the coup was announced.
He has tried to fly back to the capital city but it is unclear whether he has succeeded.
This is not (just) about ethnic conflicts :
Nkurunziza and General Niyombare are both former Hutu rebel leaders.
They also belong to the same governing party, and Niyombare was both Ambassador to Kenya and intelligence chief, a post he was dismissed from earlier this year.
Like in Burkina Faso earlier this year, public opinion in Burundi seems to be in support of the coup as a way to oppose African life rulers:
What’s happening today in Burundi is reminiscent of what took place late last year in Burkina Faso, when long-time head of state Blaise Compaore was deposed by the military after declaring his intention to run for yet another term.
While the situation in Burkina Faso is still in flux, it was a key moment, as the public massively supported the coup, fed up with Compaore’s decades-long rule (..)but The situation in Burundi is also different, particularly given the protracted civil war which ended in 2005.
Despite the recent arrests of FIFA officials due to indictments laid by the US Department of Justice, the world football governing body has said that its elections, which it calls the 65th FIFA Congress, will continue as scheduled today.
Current FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who headed the organisation while the two-decade siege of corruption, bribery and money laundering was allegedly taking place, is seeking a fifth term at today's congress.
Blatter has refused to resign amidst the scandal, despite several calls for him to step down.

The ISIS, an Al Qaeda off-shoot has come to occupy large swathes of Syria and Iraq, leaving behind a trail of horror and destruction in a few months.
Areas captured by the fanatic group which insists on wiping out all sites of "heresy" and "apostasy" include the Cradle of Civilisation, an area rich in history since ancient times.
The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has a dedicated page entitled Safeguarding Syrian Cultural Heritage just to track the damage the Syrian conflict, now in its fourth year, has brought to the country's history.
According to UNESCO:
Illegal excavations and looting have exponentially increased since the beginning of the conflict in Syria.
These actions have damaged many historical sites and museums, and important Syrian cultural property has disappeared from the country to end up on the black market and/or in private collections.
Numerous archaeological sites in Syria are being systematically targeted for clandestine excavations by well-organized and often armed groups.
Excavated archaeological objects of cultural significance make a lucrative trade for unscrupulous dealers operating both locally and internationally.
Sites situated near the borders are, in general, more susceptible to being targeted by looters who take advantage of their location to quickly and illegally export artefacts out of Syria.
On the condition of museums, the damage assessment of museums page notes:
Most of the damage to museums in Syria has occurred in the north-western region of the country, where there have been incidents of looting of valuable cultural property, and many works of art are currently unaccounted for.
A large number of museums have also had their infrastructure damaged as a result of being caught in the armed conflict.

Abel Wabela.
Drawing by Melody Sundberg.
In April 2014, nine bloggers and journalists were arrested in Ethiopia.
Several of these men and women had worked with Zone9, a collective blog that covered social and political issues in Ethiopia and promoted human rights and government accountability.
Four of them were Global Voices authors.
In July, they were charged under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation.
They have been behind bars ever since and their trial has only recently begun.
This marks the sixth post in our series – “They Have Names” – that seeks to highlight the individual bloggers who are currently in jail.
We wish to humanize them, to tell their particular and peculiar stories.
This week, Swedish blogger and artist Melody Sundberg writes about Abel Wabela, a member of Zone9 and the manager of Global Voices' Amharic site.
I have never been to Ethiopia, but I have followed the never-ending trials of the bloggers closely through social media and conversations.
A name often mentioned is that of Abel Wabela, a 28-year-old blogger, author and translator for Global Voices.
During the first three months of the bloggers' detention in Maekelawi*, Abel refused to sign a prepared confession paper in which he, together with the other bloggers, were incriminated.
For this, Abel underwent extreme torture.
According to the Ethiopian Human Rights Project (EHRP), he was beaten by a person using a stick, and his feet were whipped by someone using a computer plug cable.
He was forced to lay on the floor while interrogators stomped on his back, neck and face.
Since then, he has had to use a hearing aid as a result of worsened hearing impairment.
According to Endalk Chala, co-founder of the blogging group, Abel had suffered poor treatment even before his arrest.
One day, three weeks before the arrest, Abel was beaten as he was walking home from work.
Several people appeared and beat him so severely that he lost his consciousness, and they took his cell phone and laptop.
He feared beating was a threat, intended to make him stop blogging.
But Abel continued his work.

I wanted to know more about Abel, so I asked some of those close to him to describe their friend.
Endalk Chala describes Abel as the most kindhearted and wonderful soul.
Abel is a man of knowledge and a great conversationalist, and he believes in open and honest discussions.
Jomanex Kasaye describes Abel as being straight forward and knowing what he stands for. At the same time, he is very humble.
Abel is always hungry for more knowledge.
He likes to spend his time in discussions with historians, university lecturers and authors. His faith is important to him.
He loves attending in church.
He often visited prisoners, having the country and its people in his heart.
He always thinks of others rather than himself.
The heartless treatment of Abel continued after his detention in Maekelawi.
Following one of the trials in February, prison officials had forgotten to handcuff him on the bus heading back to the prison.
For this, Abel was punished.
They tied him up with dog chains for the whole day, and took away his hearing aid.
During a trial in May, Abel was once again punished for using his right to expression.
Abel questioned the judges for not letting the detainees speak.
For this, he was sentenced to four months for contempt of court.
The kind of treatment Abel has been put through could break anyone.
Still, Abel has kept showing resistance.
I ask myself: What is it that makes someone risk being jailed, beaten and tortured?
Reading Abel's latest letter, I find the answer:
My purpose is to communicate.
My aim is to learn.
My reason is to engage in a deep insightful intuitive understanding of life and fight bystander apathy.
This is my mission as a human.
It is not a task I was given from a stranger.
I will not allow anyone to trample on this basic right.
I will not bargain with anyone whether they are people of political power, individuals, institutions or even a society to give away my basic speech right.
I practice my free speech rights in a public sphere, in my own private space, on social media, in prison, in a court room, in a police interrogation rooms.
I use my free speech rights responsibly without hindering other peoples’ rights and I want to practice it everywhere.
In hindsight warnings, intimidations, arrest and torture have not stopped me from exercising my free speech rights neither they do in the future.
"To fight bystander apathy...
This is my mission as a human."
The sentences form a simple answer to a difficult question.
The reason Abel keeps using his freedom of expression is because it is a basic right that can be exercised everywhere in every situation.
He has made the choice to use this right, because speaking out against injustice is to fight bystander apathy.
I am more than certain that he will continue defending this right for the rest of his life.
We live in a world where some label the use of freedom of expression as an act of terrorism.
We also live in a world where others are sacrificing their freedom while defending our right to speak our minds.
The Zone9 Bloggers defended human rights.
They chose to stand up against injustice.
They chose to speak the truth.
For this, they were robbed of their freedom.
I do not know Abel today, but I look forward to the day I will.
* Following their arrest, the bloggers and journalists were jailed in Maekelawi.
Maekelawi is the Federal Police Crime Investigation Sector in Addis Ababa.
Political prisoners, journalists, bloggers, protest organizers among others are held there before proceeding to prison.
Human Rights Watch has reported about torture, coercive interrogation methods and poor detention conditions taking place there.

Protests in Niamey, Niger via Abdoulaye Hamidou on twitter (with his permission)
20,000 Nigeriens took to the streets in Niamey, Niger on June, 6.
There are multiple causes for the protests: endemic poverty, mediocre governance and restricted free speech are among the main grievances from Nigerien civil society.
These protests come on the hill of similar uprisings in Burkina Faso, Burundi and Togo.
The government resigned in Burkina Faso while elections are postponed in Burundi.
In May, citizens in Lome protested presidential election results that saw Togolese president Faure Gnassingbe won a third term.
Photo from the Facebook Page of #myfriend campaign.
A selfie campaign in Myanmar promotes tolerance and friendship amid rising cases of hate speech, discrimination, and communal violence accross the country.
The Facebook campaign is led by young people from Yangon, the country's biggest city, and it launched last April by asking the public to pose for selfies with their friends who belong to a different ethnic groups or religions.
The campaign uses the hashtags #myfriend and #friendship_has_no_boundaries.
Since 2012, there have been intermittent clashes between some Buddhists and minority Muslims in central, western, and northern areas of Myanmar, including in Meikhtila in central Myanmar, where the houses of both Buddhist and Muslim communities were burned down and thousands of people were displaced.
The most serious communal violence took place in October 2012 in the Rakhine state of western Myanmar, where Rohingya Muslims have been living in refugee camps near the city of Sittwe.
The Myanmar government considers the Rohingya to be illegal immigrants.
At the same time, online hate speech and harassment has been widespread on Myanmar's social media, creating an atmosphere intolerance and racism.
Below are some photos from the #MyFriend campaign to prove that people in Myanmar, especially the young, are determined to end hate by showing respect and friendship.
Han Seth Lu, a Buddhist, uploads a photo with his Muslim friend:
I'm a Buddhist and My Friend is a Muslim.
I'm a Boy and She is a Girl.
We are different but we accept each other.
Life is not permanent, enjoy yourself right now.
Because friendship has no boundaries. #MyFriend #Friendship_has_no_boundaries - looking for peace with May Khin
Rody Din, a Christian, shares a photo with his Buddhist friend from Thailand:
He is a Sikh and I'm a Muslim.
But we are friends.
Although we have diversities,we share our own opinions and beliefs, we accept and respect our different identities. #Myfriend #Friendship_has_no_boundaries
Professor Pierre de Vos weighs in on the debate about assisted dying in South Africa after a South African High Court ruled that a dying person is entitled to be assisted by a qualified medical doctor to end his or her life:
It is important to note that the ruling does not force any person to end his or her life or to assist anyone else to do so.
It remains a personal choice.
The judgment thus confirms that the criminal law (or, I would add, the ethical rules of the HPCSA ) cannot be used to enforce the moral, religious or ethical beliefs of some on everyone.
However, this does not force those who hold such moral, religious or ethical beliefs to act in breach of their beliefs.
Moreover, if the Constitutional Court confirms the judgment it would be desirable for Parliament to pass legislation to establish a system with minimum safeguards in order to protect patients.
In the absence of such legislation a patient would have to approach a court for permission to be legally assisted to die.

More than 8,000 people have been killed, twice as many are injured, 2 million people have been displaced, and an estimated total of 8 million have been affected in some way.
(For more information, see Global Voices' special coverage page.)
The Nepal Photo Project is working to capture this historic catastrophe in pictures.
The project belongs to a team of ten photographers in and around Kathmandu, led by photographer Sumit Dayal and writer Tara Bedi, who launched the initiative shortly after the April 25 earthquake.
So far, it has more than 61,400 followers in Instagram and more than 7,600 followers on Facebook.
Using crowdsourced photos, contributing photographers retell the story of life after the earthquakes: the devastation, rescue, relief, reconstruction, and the rays of hope for the future.
The increasing popularity of the project is due primarily to its simplicity: contributors merely add a hashtag to their images, writing #nepalphotoproject, and include a short caption about the photo's context and characters.
Organizers want to keep it more functional and personal in nature.
The project's recent posts show how life in Nepal is returning to normal and how people are rebuilding.
This is Manju Gurung.
Whenever I try to take her picture, she giggles and runs away.
She and her family have been living together with two more families in a chicken shed since April 25. At least the school is on for her and she is happy to be with her friends.
She told me they have no classes, they only play to pass their time.
From next week she is hoping the regular school will start.

Zelalem Kiberet at 25.
Photo from Zelalem's blog.
In April 2014, nine bloggers and journalists were arrested in Ethiopia.
Several of these men and women had worked with Zone9, a collective blog that covered social and political issues in Ethiopia and promoted human rights and government accountability.
And four of them were Global Voices authors.
They have been behind bars ever since, their trial postponed time and again.
This marks the third post in our series – “They Have Names” – that seeks to highlight the individual bloggers who are currently in jail.
We wish to humanize them, to tell their particular and peculiar stories.
This story comes from Endalk Chala, a founding member of the Zone9 collective who was spared arrest on account of being in the United States, where he is pursuing a PhD.
I met Zelalem Kiberet in 2012.
I had come to know him through his blog, where he wrote about curious and inspiring literary pieces, art, politics, history and philosophy.
For me, reading his posts on philosophy and chatting with him occasionally on Facebook was never intimate enough, so I decided to meet him in person.
At that time, I always longed to meet my online friends.
This is what eventually led to us forming Zone9.
That day it was Befeqadu, who is the dynamo of the collective, who organized our meeting.
We met in a café called Pizza, at the heart of Addis Ababa.
Befeqadu and I arrived first and then Zelalem joined us.
He greeted us warmly.
We were sitting at table near the door.
He ordered a cup of macchiato and then we had one of our best conversations.
Zelalem was a graduate student at the School of Law of Addis Ababa University, and also taught law at Ambo University.
I consider myself very lucky to have worked with Zelalem.
Because of his wit, humorous writings and uncompromising digs on religion, his friends tweaked Zelalem’s name into the name of the imminent French writer Zola, whom Zelalem himself read with great enthusiasm.
Our Zola’s love for philosophy and art is so visible that he made the banner of his blog the famous painting of Jacques-Louis David’s "The Death of Socrates".
The Death of Socrates, by Jacques-Louis David.
Released to public domain. Image via Wikimedia.
Zola’s hit tweets were so illustrious among his peers that I would dare to say that at the time of his arrest, Zola was becoming the most commonly read Ethiopian on Twitter.
His humorous and witty tweets established him as a rising literary talent to watch.
Zola can also write longer moving pieces.
In one of his blog posts he mocked a subject which mainstream newspapers from inside Ethiopia haven’t dared to acknowledge.
In his blog post, titled “How to create your own religion? – An Ethiopian guide", he wrote a long satire on how state-run outlets broadcast programs in an effort to create a cult personality of the late former president Meles Zenawi.
These kinds of his writings put Zola on the radar of the Ethiopian government.
Today, after over a year in prison, he is facing trumped-up terrorism charges for being a true intellectual, and one who uses humor to communicate his critiques.
On the banner of his blog, Zola has written ‘Let Freedom Ring’.
For as long as he is behind bars, we must carry out this wish on his behalf.

New research by Afrobarometer, a project that measures public attitudes in Sub Saharan Africa, suggests that most Africans support two-term presidential term limits for their presidents.
The report, based on surveys in 34 African countries, says:
This is true even in those countries that have never had term limits and those that have removed them in the past 15 years.
Continuing efforts to dispense with term limits thus reveal a major disconnect between African leaders and African citizens on this issue, underlining the lingering legacy of big-man rule on the continent and highlighting the fragility of African democracies.
The report discusses the term limit extension phenomenon in African politics:
At the end of the 20th century, many African countries adopted presidential term limits aspart (sic) of a broader set of constitutional rules that accompanied the transition from personal and authoritarian rule to pluralistic modes of governance.
While term limits were widely embraced by the larger African public, these rules have in recent years come under increasing attack from incumbent presidents seeking to extend their tenures.
In the first six months of 2015 alone, the presidents of Burundi, Benin, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda have either personally or through their supporters expressed the intention to dispense with or circumvent term limits in order to seek additional terms of office.
These quests are often couched in language that portrays a leader’s desire for more time in office as a response to popular demands.
A striking example was Blaise Compaoré’s 2014 attempt to seek a third term in Burkina Faso, which was stopped by popular protests that forced the president not just to back off, but to leave the country.
But other leaders have been more successful in their efforts to avoid relinquishing power.
David Shinn, the former US ambassador to Burkina Faso and Ethiopia, says the track record on term limits in African politics is "mixed":
Early in 2008, thirty-three of sub-Saharan Africa’s forty-eight countries had constitutions that contained term limit provisions.
Some African leaders have willingly turned over power in compliance with these constitutional requirements.
They include recent, former leaders of Botswana, Benin, Cape Verde, Mali, Mozambique, Säo Tomé e Principe and Tanzania.
Nelson Mandela in South Africa stepped down after one term.
Jerry Rawlings of Ghana and Daniel arap Moi of Kenya complied with constitutional term limits under duress.
Several African leaders tried but failed to change the term limit provision of their constitution so that they could run again.
Zambia’s Frederick Chiluba, Malawi’s Bakili Muluzi and Nigeria’s Olusegun Obasanjo ultimately bowed to the will of the political system and accepted term limits.
Other African incumbents managed to change the constitution so that they could have at least one additional term.
Current or recent leaders in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Namibia, Togo, Uganda and Algeria are among those who successfully changed term limit requirements in order to prolong their time in office.
In 2008, Cameroon’s parliament eliminated the two-term (seven years per term) limit for Paul Biya.
I served at the U.S. embassy in Yaounde when Biya first became president in 1982.
He will be able to run again in 2011 after twenty-eight years as president.
The president of Niger is currently trying to change the constitution so that he can run for a third term.
In total, 18 African countries do not have presidential term limits.
Sudan presents a unique case; although President Bashir has been in power since 1989, his reelection earlier this year—when he carried 94 percent of the vote—is technically only his second term in office, following the secession of South Sudan in 2011 after a national referendum.
During the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) meeting last month in Accra, Ghana, West African leaders dropped the idea of instituting a two-term limit on the presidency across the region, after The Gambia and Togo, the only member states without term limits, opposed the move.
Internet users in West Africa were widely critical of the decision.
A conflict in Burundi continues today, sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a third term.
Riots have spread throughout the country in protest.
The UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon has even called on Ugandan President Museveni to intervene.
At an impromptu East African Community (EAC) meeting, former army general Godefroid Niyombare (who'd been suspended just a few months earlier) staged a coup in an attempt to oust Nkurunziza.
The events in Burundi and in other countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, and Rwanda have sustained a growing debate among Africans about term limits.
For example, in Uganda where voters face the same predicament of a president that is seeking a fifth term, netizens celebrated the coup in Burundi:
Ugandans are celebrating the coup in tiny Burundi yet @KagutaMuseveni is about to go for 7th term @samirasawlani @RobertAlai @WanjikuRevolt — Kenny Kipkirui (@kenkorir) May 13, 2015

Many jokes were even made about the coup in Burundi.

In Zimbabwe, where president Robert Mugabe has been in power since 1980, someone named Hungwe commented on a story in the New Zimbabwe, joking:
Minimum of 4 terms of course!
One term to fill up personal pockets.
Another term for the family.
Another one for relatives and friends, and probably another one to look at national issues and avenues to stay in power.
Another Zimbabwean, "William Doctor," asked:
Then why has the 2-term limit been so successful in the United States?
And why is Africa such a dismal failure?
"Political Analyser," apparently based in Zambia, simply advised:
Never accept that dictator to come for a third term
"Bants-a-nius Dante" warned:
These are bad times for Mugabe,Hayatou ,Nkuruzinza and other sit tight leaders all over the world... — Bants-a-nius Dante™ (@ThaSoulReaver_) June 2, 2015
Another netizen argued that the problem is not only with African presidents but also with "serial" opposition presidential candidates, like the ones in Zambia:
What else do you expect from HH 6 elections, Nawakwi 6, Nevers Mumba 2, please leave space for others you have suffered electoral nightmare and its enough.
However, commenting on a story about Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who said that he is open to leaving power, Abullah Omar wrote:
I do not understand this fixation of a term limit for an elected office.if the people opt for continuity why deny them their choice.
Professor Nshuti Manasseh expressed similar views:
But Rwandese want him to stay on to ensure stability and development of a very fragile country Rwanda is 21 years after genocide.
So if Rwandese requests him to lead them for more than two term limits, isn't that democracy?
"Eng.Murenzi Daniel" thought Rwanda and Burundi presented very different third-term political scenarios:
"Leader"&"Dictator" Kagame FORCED by the people for a 3rd term (Leader) Nkuruzinza FORCING himself on the people for a 3rd term.
(Dictator) — Eng.Murenzi Daniel (@murenzidaniel) June 2, 2015
Raymond Maro, based in Tanzania, was more optimistic:
Tanzania was the first country in sub Saharan Africa to put Presidential term limit.
By 2017 all African states should adopt this #DGTrends — Raymond C Maro (@RaymondCMaro) September 16, 2014
Kenyan blogger Ken Opalo noted that the record suggests presidents trying to extend their limits are more likely to succeed:
So what we see in the existing data is that conditional on *overtly* trying to scrap term limits African Heads of State are more likely to succeed than not (9 successes, 6 failures).
However, this observation doesn’t tell us anything about the presidents who did not formally consider term limit extensions.
For instance, in Kenya (Moi) and Ghana (Rawlings), presidents did not initiate formal debate on the subject but were widely rumored to have tried to do so.
So it’s probably the case that presidents who are more likely to succeed self-select into formally initiating public debate on the subject of term limit extension, thereby tilting the balance.
And if you factor in the countries that have had more than one episode of term-limited presidents stepping down, suddenly the odds look pretty good for the consolidation of the norm of term limits in Sub Saharan Africa.
He concluded on an optimistic note:
I wouldn’t rule out, in the next decade or so, the adoption of an African Union resolution (akin to the one against coups) that sanctions Heads of State who violate constitutional term limits.

Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza's attempt to extend his two-term limit led to mass protests and later an unsuccessful military coup on May 13, 2015 while he was on a regional meeting in Tanzania.
The coup delayed his return to Burundi.
A total of 18 African countries do not have presidential term limits, although new research suggests that most Africans support two-term presidential term limit.
Politicians clinging to power despite the will of the people is no laughing matter, but a little laughter is sometimes just what the doctor ordered.
The failed coup in Burundi led to a slew of humorous tweets, especially from Ugandans whose own president is seeking a fifth term.
Kemigisa Jacky, a Ugandan journalism student, making reference to Nkurunziza's supposed claim that God has approved his bid for a third term, wrote:
But I am curious to know what God is now telling Nkurunziza!
Considering it was God who okayed 3rd term run. #AskNkurunziza — kemigisa jacky (@JackyKemigisa) May 13, 2015
Ugandan Twitter user MartinAhabwe asked Nkurunziza:
Any improvement on your Maths chief,which term is it now,1st,2nd or Zero? #AskNkurunziza — MartinAhabwe (@AhabweMartin) May 13, 2015
Some created the #NkurunzizaPlaylist hashtag, where they share titles of songs for Nkurunziza.
The YouTube video below was shared on Twitter under #NkurunzizaPlaylist by Mkandamizaji.
This was before Nkurunziza returned to Burundi from Tanzania following the coup.
The song is "I Am Coming Home" by Morgan Heritage:
Allan Ssenyonga, a Ugandan teacher and writer, chose a song by the late American rapper Tupac Shakur:

A traffic jam at Zarghoon road in Quetta, Pakistan.

The post was written by Adnan Aamir for The Balochistan Point.
It is republished on Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.
Life was put on hold for many residents, students, patients and commuters of Quetta city, when the Prime Minister of Pakistan and his entourage arrived in Balochistan province's capital last week.
According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands are directly and indirectly affected every time road blocks are put up for the security of very important people or VIPs in Quetta, a city home to about 1 million.
This is fifth time VIP security restricted traffic into the city this year.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif reached Quetta in the morning to participate in the cross-party political meeting "All Parties Conference".
The meeting was called in the aftermath of the Mastung bus carnage in Balochistan, where militants killed 22 Pashtun passengers in an ethnically motivated attack.
All major roads of Quetta located in the vicinity of Governor House, where the meeting was taking place, were shut down on the pretext of security.The last few years, whenever a important politician or powerful person visits Quetta, all major roads are blocked and closed to normal traffic.
Commuters travelling from the outskirts of the city to the main downtown had to walk two-three kilometres to reach their destination due to the closed roads.
Public transport was not allowed to enter the center of the city and passengers were dropped outside the road blocks.
Patients and people heading to one of the city's main hospitals Sandmen Provincial had to go through long agonizing hours of waiting before entering the facility, which is near the Governor House.
“I travelled from my village in Kalat district to Quetta for an urgent errand but due to the closure of roads I will not be able to reach my destination on time,” Murtaza Baloch, told The Balochistan Point.
He added, “Now I have to come back to Quetta some other day and this is huge mental stress for me.”
Three major schools in the city St. Francis Grammar School, St. Joseph Convent School and Sacred Heart School were forced to declare a holiday by the city administration.
The schools are located along the route used for the prime minister.
“Whenever our Prime Minister visits this city, a school day of my daughters is wasted because their school is closed down for that day,” said Saleem Haider, a Quetta resident.
On the day of the prime minister's visit, Muhammad Siddique, a car owner stuck in a traffic jam said important meetings and VIP movements should be restricted to the high security military cantonment of the city.
“If the prime minister and Balochistan government have any concern for Quetta's residents," Siddique said, "then they should conduct all their meetings in Quetta Cantonment and spare us from unnecessary mental stress.”
Is going topless an effective strategy for reviving the Kenyan tourism industry following attacks from militant group Al Shabaab?:

Edom Kassaye on a research trip in Harar, Ethiopia, July 2013.
Photo by Endalk Chala.
In April 2014, nine bloggers and journalists were arrested in Ethiopia.
Several of these men and women had worked with Zone9, a collective blog that covered social and political issues in Ethiopia and promoted human rights and government accountability.
And four of them were Global Voices authors.
In July 2014, they were charged under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation.
They have been behind bars ever since and their trial has only recently begun.
This post is part of our series – “They Have Names” – that seeks to highlight the individual bloggers who are currently in jail.
We wish to humanize them, to tell their particular and peculiar stories.
This story comes from Endalk Chala, a founding member of the Zone9 collective who was spared arrest on account of being in the United States, where he is pursuing a PhD in Media Studies.
I first came to know Edom Kassaye through Befeqadu, the great convener of the Zone9 blogging collective.
We met in 2012, when she had just returned from a year-long reporting trip in Kenya. She furnished me with many wonderful stories that she covered during her trip.
The stories she told me and the relative journalistic freedom she experienced in Kenya generated deep conversations about the unfortunate situation of Ethiopia’s freedom of expression.
From then on, until I left the country in 2013, Edom and I met frequently for coffee.
We grew to become good friends.
When I think about my time with Edom, I realize it is no wonder that she got arrested along with six members of the Zone9 collective.
People ask why Edom was arrested and charged with terrorism when she was not a member of the group.
I believe it was Edom’s willingness to bring about a gentle change in Ethiopia’s polarized political environment that suggested an affinity between her and the Zone9 blogging collective.
We shared common principles.
Edom participated in every single online campaign the Zone9 blogging collective held.
It seems that her participation in the online campaigns got her noticed by state authorities monitoring social networks.
In the days and weeks leading up to her arrest, Edom resisted pressure to serve as an informant about her friends from the collective.
Instead, she opted to be jailed with her friends.
Her integrity and convictions demonstrate something special about her character — her intense commitment to active citizenship within an increasingly brainwashed and fragmented populous.
Jomanex, an exiled blogger, a colleague and friend often calls Edom ‘Miss Integrity’.

Edom is one of the few female journalists I know in the country who practiced journalism on multiple platforms.
Her CV reads as a fast-growing multimedia journalist with keen interest in environment, public health, and social justice.
For outsiders, Edom looked like any young aspiring journalist whose works appeared everywhere from state-owned daily newspaper to independent Addis Ababa radio stations.
But a few details set her apart.
Edom began her journalism career at the state-owned daily newspaper.
Working as a senior reporter, she tried to inspire optimism about hihg-quality journalism that the Ethiopian state media has rarely exhibited.
But her tendency to ask critical questions was incompatible with the sycophantic culture of state journalism and she decided to take a different career path.
In 2011, she won her reporting fellowship in Kenya, where she focused on environmental reporting.
Upon her return, she decided not to work for state media, opting instead to freelance for various media organizations.
When we began Global Voices' Amharic language site in 2012 she served as a volunteer translator for the site.
In 2013, Edom, Befeqadu, Zelalem and I worked together to produce a report on the state of freedom of expression in Ethiopia which later was submitted to United Nations Commission on Human Rights for their Universal Periodic Review.

In 2011, the government arrested and prosecuted more than 12 journalists on sham terrorism charges, an act that has become routine since 2005.
Edom took pride in showing solidarity with these journalists.
She routinely traveled back and forth to the prisons to visit award-winning journalists such as Reeyot Alemu and Eskinder Nega, who are still serving their long prison terms.
This gave Edom a glimpse of what these journalists’ lives looked like in prison.
As a gesture of her solidarity toward the journalists, she regularly tweeted the counts of the days the journalists were made to spend in the prison.
I wonder if she ever imagined that she would share a similar fate with them.
Once I asked her where she drew the inspiration for using her Twitter handle as timer to document the dire situation of the journalists.
She told me that in Kality Prison, where Eskinder Nega is held, the guards count prisoners every morning using morning whistles.
They shout loudly – ‘Kotera፣ Kotera፣ Kotera’ which means make yourselves available for the tally, for the tally, for the tally.
This ritual is common throughout the prison system in Ethiopia.
It has two purposes: the first is to make the prisoners arise early; the second is to make the prisoners available for morning count.
Edom poignantly took this counting ritual and used it in her tweets, to document the days the journalists were forced to spend behind bars.
Edom did this until the day she herself become one of them.
Since April 25, 2014, Edom has been denied her tweeting rights for showing solidarity with these jailed journalists.
In her prison journal, where she narrated how she was arrested, she wrote:
As I walked across the street a vehicle approached me and closed my walkway.
Then a couple of hooligan looking men jumped off the car and swarmed at me and they started to ask me to get on to the vehicle.
When I resisted getting on to the vehicle one of the men twisted my wrist; at that moment I just recognized my fight not to be arrested is a futile one but I get on to the car defiantly then squeezed into the back seat in the middle of two men.
Seating in the car with reflexive silence I asked them to let me make a telephone call to my family.
They denied me and seized my mobile phone violently ….
Near sundown we arrived at notorious Maekelawi, Federal Police Investigation Centre.
I passed through a dehumanizing search before they led me to a dark cell to be with other inmates….
After a while I heard footsteps we all swarmed to have a look through a peephole to see what is going on then I have seen Mahlet being escorted to other cell….At that moment I felt a reflexive horror for my family since they would extremely be worried about my whereabouts and I felt my tears wetting my cheek.
Edom has done journalism along with her understated activism with a remarkable elegance.
She has her own unique and polite way of making sure she gets her point across without being intimidating or manipulative.
Two months ahead of my departure to the US for my graduate studies, Edom traveled to Tunisia and on her return, brought me a palm-shaped key holder which is popularly believed to provide protection from evil.
It pains me that I could not give Edom protection from the wickedness of our government.
I cherish every minute I spent with Edom, a woman who bravely stands for her convictions.
Graffiti artist Rei Blinky at work in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

Barbed wire fences, deserted streets, security guards bearing shotguns.
It sounds like the scene of a dystopian movie, but it's no movie.
This is San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the city that has been named the world's deadliest for four years running.
Recently, San Pedro Sula has tried to make a much more optimistic name for itself: home to a booming art scene.
This is largely thanks to its graffiti artists, whose brightly colored murals are popping up all around the city.
Graffiti artist Rei Blinky is what journalist Nathaniel Janowitz calls a "pioneer" for the artistic movement sweeping through the city.
Blinky was the first artist who ventured out into the practically deserted streets.
That ghost town feel has a lot to do with the city's gangs.
"You never know when a shootout is going to break out between the gangs.
So you could be walking down the street and catch a bullet," says Janowitz.
Not only did gangs dominate the streets, but the graffiti scene as well.
Blinky changed all that with his unique style that Janowitz calls "pop-art indigenous."
His work is bold, colorful and unmistakable.
"He's one of those artists that when you go past one of his paintings, you instantly know it's a Rei Blinky. There's no one else like him," Janowitz says.
Blinky has paved the road for many more artists to join him.
"The movement has grown a lot, and there's really a blossoming art scene in the city," Janowitz says.
Many other artists are becoming known on the streets: Baruc, who pays homage to the women of Honduras in his murals, and Carlos Badia, who creates mixed-media work.
"It seems like people in San Pedro Sula, while they recognize that the problem is very real with the gangs in the city, they also recognize that they can't spend their lives in fear.
And they have to be willing to go out into the streets and reclaim it in a peaceful fashion," Janowitz says.
"If they don't have the will or the tools to go out there with guns, they'll go out with a paintbrush."
The graffiti artists hope to connect with the young people of San Pedro Sula, many of whom choose to flee rather than stay in the turbulent city.
"Right now it seems to a lot of the children in the city, you either join the gangs or you run," Janowitz says.
Blinky and his fellow artists strive to give young people another option — to stay, in peace.
Janowitz says one of the artists' main goals is to work with children, take them off the streets and teach them about art.
Blinky is starting to spread his art beyond Honduras.
Thanks to him and his fellow artists, Janowitz says, something positive may come out of San Pedro Sula.
Janowitz is confident that Blinky will be successful.
Blinky's work is special, he says, because, "You could see it on a wall or you could see it in the Louvre.
He's that great of an artist."
If you believe that nothing good can come from a rifle, then you have to get to know the "escopetarra"—a hybrid that transforms two "lethal" weapons (an AK-47 and a guitar) into an instrument of peace.
"Escopetarra" is a Spanish blend that combines the words "escopeta" (shotgun) and "guitarra" (guitar).
In his Spanish-language podcast, Colombian musician César López talks about how he created the instrument, tracing it from the moment of its conception to all of the technical issues he faced creating it, as well as its characteristic sound.
There are more AK-47s in the world than any other gun, thanks to how unusually cheap the weapon is to make.
It is estimated that there are 35-to-50 million AK-47s in existence, not counting those that are manufactured illegally each year.
"First of all, the AK-47 has caused the most deaths by any weapon on the planet.
It's been used in South Africa, the Middle East, Central America, and also in Colombia", stated López in an interview with the American television network, Univision.
The first "escopetarra" was made in 2003 using a Winchester rifle and a Stratocaster electric guitar.
The rifle is taken apart in a way that it is no longer considered a weapon and cannot be used as such.
Currently, about 20 "escopetarras" have been presented to prominent musicians and international leaders who stand for peace, including the Colombian band, Aterciopelados, Argentinean musician Fito Páez, and UNESCO.

Two alleged gunmen have been captured after an explosion and gunfire rang out at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace today, a popular tourist attraction and seat of Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu.
Crowds panicked and people fled over gates and into the streets after two assailants unleashed a stun grenade and several rounds of automatic gunfire, allegedly targeting police officers standing guard at the Ottoman-era site.
Police immediately blockaded the scene.
The Associated Press reported one police officer was slightly injured.
Though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the Associated Press the state-run Anadolu news agency reported that the assailants were members of the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Army-Front, or DHKP-C.
The Guardian also reported that Turkish news agencies were quoting police sources as saying DHKP-C was behind the attack.
Dolmabahçe Palace stands as one the last great remnants of the Ottoman Empire in Istanbul.
The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, died there in 1938.
The palace features exhibitions for tourists, though other areas house government agencies, including the seat of the Turkish prime minister.
The incident comes in the midst of heightened tensions in Turkey, as sitting President Reccip Tayyip Erdogan and the Justice Development Party (AKP) issue new offensives against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and the Islamic State in Syria.

Also on Wednesday, eight soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing in Siirt, a southeastern Turkish region bordering Syria and Iraq.
According to the BBC, that attack was blamed on PKK militants.
“Turkey is on high alert,” said Eyup Kabogan, 27, a bartender at the Pierre Loti Hotel in Sultanahmet, in central Istanbul about five kilometers south of the palace.
“Even I have to watch where I am going when I walk down the street now.”
“I am Kurdish, by the way,” Kabogan said, adding, “but I know that there are other means to change things (politically).”
Tourists should stay away from crowded areas and police stations, Kabogan warned, though he said that terror groups are “not targeting tourists, but security officers.”
Turkey’s political landscape is in flux after Davutoglu’s attempts to create a power-sharing coalition failed last week.
On Tuesday, he gave Erdogan a mandate to form a new government ahead of elections expected in November.
“I don’t really know what to say (about today’s attack),” said Berk Çoker, 21, who is Turkish and a rising junior at Stanford University.
A computer science major, Coker had plans to return to his home country after a software engineering internship in the San Francisco Bay Area this summer.
“As evidenced by the attacks and the unformed coalition, the political climate is pretty tense, making it an unsafe country for travel,” Coker said.
In response to growing violence, according to The Telegraph, the Erdogan government has detained more than 2,500 suspected members of IS, PKK and DHKP-C.

It is called Yanga.
In the middle of intense vegetation in southeastern Veracruz, a state along the Mexican Gulf, the town of Yanga is evidence to the presence and settlement of Africans in Mexico.
On our way to the Port of Veracruz, we stopped at Yanga and saw the agricultural fields full of caña and corn surrounding the area, also rich in coffee plantations; the tropical weather invites you to be outside, under the sun's open arms.
Yanga claims to have been the first free African town in the Americas, proclaimed on October 3, 1631.
Afro-Mexicans proudly share the story of “El Yanga,” apparently an enslaved prince from the Yang-Bara tribe from Gabon, who helped slaves to be free from the Spanish around 1570.
One of the town’s plazas shows his statue, presenting El Yanga as a defiant, proud man.
The main plaza, the portales, and the main church are as typical as in many other Mexican towns inviting serene strolls.
Yanga is peaceful and emanates longevity.
Many centuries and people have lived and died there, perhaps oblivious to history, yet making history themselves.
Former Tanzanian Prime Minister and main opposition presidential candidate Edward Lowassa.

Tanzania's October 25 General Election will be the most tightly contested election in the country's history after hugely popular former Prime Minister, Edward Lowassa, defected from the ruling party to join the main opposition bloc.
Lowassa defected in late July after he was eliminated from the list of presidential aspirants for the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).
He announced his intention to run for the opposition bloc Chama Cha Demokrasia and Maendeleo (Chadema) shortly after.
Lowassa claims that he unfairly lost his bid to become the ruling party's candidate.
He now represents a union of four political parties fighting for the adoption of a new constitution.
Given that Lowassa commands huge support, especially from young people, this is the first time during the history of multiparty politics that the country's opposition has a genuine chance of winning.
After Lowassa’s defection, a number of key members of the ruling party including Members of Parliament, councilors and regional officials followed him to Chadema.
His switchover has ruffled feathers, however.
Until recently, Chadema considered Lowassa corrupt and unprincipled.
Chadema led calls for him to go when he was implicated in a corruption scandal that culminated in his resignation in 2009.
He has constantly denied that his office was involved in accepting kickbacks for a major energy contract from American company Richmond Development.
Some members of Chadema have left the party in protest.
But Chadema's chances may be boosted by the appearance of Juma Duni Haji as Lowassa's running mate.
Haji, who has run on opposition tickets in Tanzanian presidential elections in the past, was Minister of Infrastructure and Communications until Lowassa defected.
Liberation time is now'
Lowassa’s popularity was clearly noted when his nomination was endorsed by 1.5 million people.
The YouTube video below from AyoTV shows the day Lowassa got nomination forms:
Lowassa brought Dar Es Salaam to a halt.
The only other time Dar Es Salaam had witnessed such a huge crowd was when U.S. President Barack Obama visited the country in 2013.
Social media networks are abuzz with excitement.
If elections took place on Twitter, the outcome would be as good as determined.
Good God, our cry has been heard at last.
Liberation time is now.
Lets all vote on October 25.
Albert Gasper Msando compared Lowassa to Robin Hood and El Chapo:
Lowassa ni Robin Hood wa Kimasai.
Au ni El Chapo wa kitanzania.
Lowassa is a Maasai Robin Hood.
Or Tanzanian El Chapo.
Look at the hands he touches and not the toes he stepped on.
Mwamfupe Anyisile advised the ruling party:
They should prepare themselves psychologically to leave the state house in peace without any force.
Given Edward wished:
If the elections are to be held today, I'm pretty sure Lowassa is going to *drops phone* — Given Edward (@GIVENALITY) August 11, 2015
4 Samaritan Lepers described Lowassa’s charisma thus:
Lowassa is that guy who walks into your 'area' and all of a sudden you forget what you were doing.
DirectoR NiCKLASS touched on a stereotype that associates Chadema leaders with khaki fatigues:
Honorable Lowassa, Tanzanians are anxious to see you in khaki fatigues.
Responding to the argument that Chadema is not old enough to govern, Edward Lowassa himself said:
Those who say Chadema cannot govern because it is still young do not understand.
TANU governed the country when it was 7 years old, Chadema is 23 years old.
Isack Danford tweeted:
Public defiance.
Public defiance. Uasi wa jamii.
Changes in the making.
Public defiance.
Changes in the making.
CCM should completely go, I don’t like them.
Mwamfupe Anyisile gave away her voting preference:
Let @EdwardLowassa be the Tanzania Fifth president, — Mwamfupe Anyisile (@Anyisile) August 15, 2015
And Leylah Malweezy believes Lowassa has divine backing:
You are truly God’s choice, I even see you as president already. May God bless you to be the winner.
On a lighter note, George Roberts shared a photo showing Chadema’s unique choice of space for publicity:
Tanzanian opposition party using every available bit of space for some publicity at today's Chadema rally in Mbeya https://t.co/gmSm0leUdB — George Roberts (@g_m_roberts) August 14, 2015
But not everyone supports Lowassa and Chadema.
Responding to Musa Kilembo's observation that Lowassa has created a catch-22 for voters Evarist Chahali said:
.@KailemboMusa Me too.
I have not only fought vs CCM's injustices but paid hefty price too.
However,I've no faith in Lowassa as alternative — Evarist Chahali (@Chahali) August 15, 2015
Suphian Juma does not trust Lowassa:
@EdwardLowassa nature never leave vacuum,how are we sure u truly anti-ccm? @MariaSTsehai @hpolepole @chademanews @to discovery @lowassateam — Suphian Juma (@SuphianJuma) August 15, 2015
While Bernard Matungwa wrote:
Two main objectives for Chadema First: Make CCM an opposition party.
Second: Loot the country!
Terrible.
Just terrible! — Bernard Matungwa (@BMatungwa) August 9, 2015
Nathaniel Imani took a jab at Lowassa’s past:
If you are sinful and corrupt, when you join Chadema you become a saint.
And Hamisi Kigwangalla is hopeful the ruling CCM will withstand the current crisis:
@UK999ers @edward_lowassa @ccm_tanzania New people within CCM will reform the party and the government, and opposition will die naturally — Hamisi Kigwangalla (@hkigwangalla) August 6, 2015

As Moscow appears to be expanding its military presence in Syria, many around the world have been busy debating Russia’s agenda in that country, asking if the Kremlin’s support for President Bashar al-Assad is compatible with the West’s campaign against ISIS, which includes efforts to remove Assad from power.
While some question Moscow’s commitment to defeating ISIS in Syria, Russia’s campaign against the extremist group at home is undeniable.
Earlier this week, Ramzan Kadyrov, the ruler of the Russian Republic of Chechnya, reminded everyone what this war looks like.
In a post on Vkontakte (Russia’s most popular online social network), Kadyrov shared a short video featuring roughly half a dozen men standing in a row with their heads bowed in shame.
Speaking Chechen, Kadyrov gestures to the men disapprovingly.
Next an old man and then an old woman speaks to the men with anger and tears.
They point.
They shout.
They bury their faces in their hands.
The video features Chechen men caught recruiting for ISIS on social networks, and the elderly people shouting at them are their relatives and local community leaders.
Kadyrov also implies that these individuals were reported to the police by their own families.
I met with the relatives of the young men who promoted ISIS on social networks.
I also invited several imams and community leaders.
All these misguided men have parents who are honest, deeply religious people who sincerely condemn their sons’ actions.
These parents repeatedly told them that they raised their sons to become the backbone of their families, to be true Muslims, and good citizens.
They also said they had no need of sons who betrayed their family, their relatives, their loved ones, Islam, and their people.
One of these young men sought out weak-minded peers and tried to convince them to go to Syria.
He circulated messages containing threats against the authorities and their families.
I told them again: there’s no place in Chechnya for anyone who even glances in the direction of ISIS.
The most important thing is that parents are working closely with the clergy and the police.
At the first sign of suspicious behavior, they immediately notify the police and local officials.
This helps prevent even worse consequences.
For two days, local authorities failed to respond to requests for help.
Finally, on Thursday, September 24, several tenants decided to take matters into their own hands, pulling up the bricks and digging out the trapped animal, which turned out to be pregnant.
Footage of the rescue soon made its way online, where it has attracted more than 77,000 views in less than 48 hours.
A local animal rights community called "Right to Life" has taken temporary custody of the dog, launching a campaign to find her a new home.
Sadly, the animal (named Belka, or "Squirrel") lost her puppies due to the stress and dehydration of being trapped underground.
She is currently rehabilitating in a clinic, where veterinarians performed an ultrasound and sterilized her.

Alongside the now-famous case of the Zone9 bloggers, there are so many detained Ethiopian bloggers, online activists and politicians, whose names are not yet on the map.
Last year on July 8, 2014, Ethiopia detained a number of local opposition leaders, bloggers, online activists and concerned citizens.
Some were released after four months of interrogation.
However, ten were charged on October 31, 2014 under Ethiopia's Anti-Terrorism Proclamation with having links to diaspora-based Ethiopian opposition groups such as Ginbot 7, applying to attend an online security training, and engaging in online activism.
Three of the 10 defendants are not members of any political party but ordinary citizens who were arrested for applying to attend a course.
These are Zelalem Workagegnehu, Yonatan Wolde and Bahiru Degu.
The controversial Anti-Terrorism Proclamation was adopted in July 2009.
Ethiopian officials tend to defend the law by arguing that its controversial provisions were copied from the existing laws of countries such as the United Kingdom.
Article 6 of the Proclamation, which has been used to curtail freedom of expression, provides that:
hosoever publishes or causes the publication of a statement that is likely to be understood by some or all of the members of the public to whom it is published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to them to the commission or preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism .
Zelalem, the first defendant, is an academic and a human rights activist who blogs at DeBirhan.
Yonatan and Bahiru, who are best described as concerned citizens, had applied along with Zelalem for a social media and Internet security training that was brought to their knowledge by a US-based Ethiopian journalist.
After an email from the Ethiopian journalist in the US was found in their possession, these young men were also arrested and later charged with applying for "a terror" when in fact the training was about Internet safety and security.
Ethiopian court last month acquitted Abraham Solomon, detained for having connections with the first defendant Zelalem, along with four other opposition politicians namely Abraha Desta, an official of the opposition Arena Tigray Party and social media activist, Yeshiwas Assefa, council member of the Blue (Semayawi) Party, Daniel Shibeshi, official of the now defunct Unity for Democracy and Justice (UDJ) party and Habtamu Ayalew, former Public Relations Head of the defunct UDJ.
However, until today they have not been released because the Prosecutor has reportedly appealed the decision.
An article by the Electronic Frontier Foundation shows the increasing attempts of silencing online activists and netizens in Ethiopia.
The organisation called Ethiopia to:
Immediately free all journalists in prison, including the remaining Zone 9 bloggers, and relieve them of all charges for the “crime” of reporting the news.
End the prosecution of individuals for pursuing security training and using encryption technologies, and free Zelalem Workagegnehu, Yonatan Wolde, Abraham Solomon, and Bahiru Degu.
Cease and desist from using invasive surveillance technologies like FinFisher and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System to spy" on Ethiopian journalists, Diaspora, and opposition groups.
While Zone9 remains among Ethiopia's best-known case of its kind, stories like that of Zelalem demonstrate that the issues these bloggers face extend far beyond a few individuals.
The next court appearance of Zelalem, Yonatan and Bahiru is Monday, 23 November 2015.
Tizita Hagere (right) plays the role of 14-year-old Hirut Assefa in 'Difret.'

This article and radio report by Joyce Hackel and Julia Barton for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on October 22, 2015, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
The word "Difret" has many shades of meaning in Ethiopia's language Amharic: it can mean both "to dare" and "to have courage," but also "to be violated."
Like its title, the film "Difret" represents many things: it's a work of fiction based on a true story of courage and change; it's one of the only films from Ethiopia shot on 35mm film; and it's got big name recognition in the form of executive producer Angelina Jolie Pitt.
But above all, the film tells the story about a traditional practice through the experience of one frightened girl caught in a whirlwind beyond her control.
"Difret" is based on the story of Aberash Bekele — called Hirut in the film — a girl who was abducted by men on horseback outside her rural Ethiopian village.
It's the day she's promoted to 5th grade in school.
Her captor — who failed to get her father's permission to marry her — insists he now has the right to marry her according to a tradition known as telefa.
But she fights back, accidentally killing him.
She faces a death sentence until attorney Meaza Ashenafi steps in to fight for her.
The resulting courtroom drama riveted the nation in 1996, when it took place.
"People started to talk about abduction all over again," Meaza Ashenafi recalls now. "It was a given, especially in the south of the country, women have been abducted for years.
There was no question about it.
But this case opened up a discussion and dialogue around this traditional practice."
Ashenafi had just established the Women Lawyer's Association two years earlier to fight for the rights of women according to Ethiopia's then-new constitution.

"Difret" played to sold-out audiences in Addis Ababa for six weeks.
When the filmmakers looked to take it abroad, they sent it to Jolie, a well-known advocate for women's rights in Africa.
"A foreign-language film from Africa has a tough road ahead for it in terms getting to an audience," filmmaker Mehret Mandefro admits.
"So having her support really helped us ... reach people I don't think we could ever reach."
Despite the big-name support and the success of "Difret," Ashenafi and Mandrefo say their work is not done: they estimate that at least 20 percent of marriages in the south of Ethiopia are coerced through some form of telefa.
"This has to stop," Ashenafi says.
"This should not be tolerated at all."
As for the subject of the film itself, Mandrefo says she had a hard life — after the case, she wasn't allowed to return to her village or family.
She attended boarding schoool, and later decided to change her name and leave Ethiopia.
But she's recently returned and working on the issue of telefa, hoping to keep girls from facing an ordeal like she did.
Friends and supporters changed their avatars on social media to this Free Alaa poster today to protest the first anniversary of his unfair imprisonment
It's been a year since the imprisonment of Egyptian blogger Alaa Abdel Fattah, an icon of the Egyptian revolution, for his activism.
Alaa was slapped a five year prison sentence for allegedly taking part in a protest and “assaulting a policeman and stealing his walkie talkie.”
He was also fined 100,000 Egyptian pounds (13,000 US dollars).
To mark the anniversary, netizens from around the world changed their avatars to Abd El Fattah's infamous picture on social media platforms to draw attention to his plight and that of thousands of other political prisoners in Egypt.
Abd El Fattah is one of 25 defendants in what has become known as the Shura Council case.
He was first arrested for this case on November 28, 2013.
Last June, he was sentenced to 15 years in absentia and given a 100,000 Egyptian pound fine after being convicted of attacking a police officer and violating a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorized demonstrations.
According to Mada Masr, which quoted the state-owned Ahram Gate website, they are accused of: “organizing an unauthorized protest outside the Shura Council in Cairo, attacking a police officer, stealing a walkie-talkie, hooliganism, aggression against police officers, blocking the road, crowding a public place and destruction of public property.”
After an appeal by his lawyers, Abd El Fattah was issued a retrial in August 2014.
On September 15, 2014, the presiding judge recused himself from the case after an incident a week earlier, in which the prosecution presented a video depicting Manal Hassan, Abd El Fattah’s wife, dancing.
Taken from Hassan’s laptop, which confiscated by police when Abd El Fattah was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November of 2013, the video bears no discernible relationship with his political activities.
The saga came to a complete circle on February 23, 2015, with the new judge issuing a five year jail sentence against Abd El Fattah and another defendant Ahmed Abdel Rahman, who was passing by the protest, and was arrested along with Abdel Fattah, as he was helping some girls who were being harassed by the police.
Abdel Rahman was also slapped a similar fine.
Eighteen other defendants were sentenced to three years in prison and three years on probation, in addition to a similar fine.
In addition to changing their avatars for the day, supporters shared some of Abd El Fattah's quotes and tweets.
His aunt, renowned novelist Ahdaf Soueif translates some of them here:
I؛m Alaa.
I'm proud that I'm doing what I can & sometimes surprise myself with what I'm capable of .." #FreeAlaa https://t.co/LlYlbPh5Wp — Ahdaf Soueif (@asoueif) October 26, 2015
"Tomorrow we'll invent solutions without locking each other up.
Lebanese blogger Abir Ghattas, who is a Global Voices Online contributor, shares another quote:
The anniversary campaign garnered reactions from around the world, as Abd El Fattah's work as a blogger, activist and coder is respected worldwide.
Internet security expert Jacob Appelbaum tweets:
Everyday, I think about Alaa Abdel Fattah and all other unjustly detained prisoners in Egypt. #FreeAlaa — Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) October 27, 2015
Global Voices Online founder Ethan Zuckerman chimes in:
#FreeAlaa One year in prison for organizing a protest is one year too long. pic.twitter.com/XcKgfUDn6F — Ethan Zuckerman (@EthanZ) October 26, 2015
And Ahmed Abdel Rahman too was not forgotten.
Many tweeted how the innocent passer-by was embroiled in this mess.

A tweet is a small thing.
But a million tweets might shake the world.
Alaa believes in the power of communication and so, today, should we. — Omar Robert Hamilton (@ORHamilton) October 26, 2015
He explains:
Since November 2013 Alaa has spent 575 days behind bars.
He has 4 more years to serve on his sentence.

Alaa's mother, Leila Soueif, is seen, right, carrying a poster bearing the names of the four prisoners still jailed by the regime from the Shura case.
In addition to Alaa and Ahmed Abdelrahman, Abdelrahman ElSayed and Abdelrahman Tarek are also imprisoned.
Despite a presidential pardon to release politicial detainees, those four prisoners were not spared.
In this video, Soueif, who is an activist as well, says they have been standing for an hour reminding people about Alaa and Ahmed Abdelrahman, who have spent a year in prison after being sentenced in the Shura case.
She explains:
Of course, the trial was a farce and they were forgotten in the pardon.
So we have four young men in the Shura case who were not included in the pardon.
We also have thousands of detainees but today we are talking about Alaa and Ahmed Abdelrahman who have spent a year in prison.
And here, his sister Mona Seif, also an activist, carries a poster which reads: "There are still so many unjustly imprisoned.
Freedom for the prisoners":
There are still so many unjustly imprisoned.
Around Cairo, posters calling for the four remaining political detainees from the Shura Council case not included in the pardon popped up.
Abd El Fattah's sister, Sanaa Seif, also an activist who was imprisoned for taking part in a protest, shares photographs of some of those posters on Facebook:

A new film follows one Syrian family through five years of upheaval.
Credit: Filmmaker Sean McAllister.
This article and radio report by Leo Hornak for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on September 24, 2015, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
The scale of the Syrian tragedy is difficult to comprehend: more than 200,000 dead, 6 million internally displaced, 3 million more living as refugees.
Now an award-winning new film is seeking to bring home the personal consequences of the war for ordinary people.
Since 2009, before the start of the current conflict, the British film-maker Sean McAllister has been filming the daily lives of one family based in Damascus.
Amer Daoud and his wife Raghda Hassan first met and fell in love as political prisoners in the cells of a Syrian prison 15 years ago.
After their release they married and had a family. McAllister’s camera has been with them and their children through every step of Syria’s revolution, its civil war and the family’s final exile in Europe. The resulting documentary is called "A Syrian Love Story."
McAllister says that he had already begun filming the family when the revolution began.
“I got a call saying ‘Do you know what?
It’s starting in Syria!’ — and the first people on the streets were Amer and his son Kaka, and they had both been arrested.”
Eventually the family is freed, but Sean himself is arrested and held in a Syrian jail for a week.
As a result, the authorities discover who he has been filming, and Amer, Raghda and the children are forced into exile for their own safety.
As the family tries to adapt to new countries and new environments, the strain begins to wear on the Amer and Raghda’s marriage.
In spite of the suffering it shows, McAllister still sees his film as ultimately optimistic: “I think the message of hope is in the defiance — the defiance of one family, who have all pulled through.”
He believes that films that humanize migrants and refugees are more important than ever.
“We see on the television people washed up on the seashore.
Amer and Raghda give a voice to all these people you see on the news.”

Tanzania has had four presidents since gaining independence from Britain in 1961.
The first, Julius Kambarage Nyerere, mostly referred to by his honoric title Mwalimu Nyerere, is the most respected and loved statesman in Tanzanian history.
He was a strong supporter of the liberation movement on the continent and anti imperialist-movement around the world.
It is no wonder that political organisations such as FRELIMO of Mozambique, the ANC and PAC of South Africa, ZANU and ZAPU of Zimbabwe, the MPLA of Angola and SWAPO of Namibia all had offices and training camps in Tanzania.
In addition, the country gave safe haven to US civil-rights activists, Black Panther party members such as Pete O'Neal and Geronimo, and Vietnam War resisters.
Sixteen years after his death on 14 October 1999, Tanzanians are using the hashtag #DearNyerere to remember him, particularly in the context of Tanzanian General Election taking place on 25 October, 2015.
You wouldn't believe that your country is a beggar'
Most tweets express a sense of nostalgia, despair and total dissatisfaction with how the country is run since his death.
Glady Shao summarised her dissatisfaction with the current political leadership in the country:
#DearNyerere if you came back today, you would definitely get a heart attack and die once again if u saw what some leaders hv been doing — GLADYS SHAO (@GladyzShao) October 14, 2015
Nabil Omar complained about mismanagement of natural resources such as Tanzanite:
#DearNyerere Tanzanite is no longer Tanzanian, you preserved it for us but the people are gaining very little from it.
Tanzanite is a rare mineral that is only found in Tanzania.
However, India is considered the largest exporter of the mineral despite Tanzanian government's partial ban on export.
James Ngonyani tweeted in Swahili:
#DearNyerere, you wouldn't believe that your country is a beggar despite being the third largest exporter of gold in the world.
W. Quiyenga wrote about popular perceptions of the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), which Nyerere helped found:
#DearNyerere, Tanzanians are saying that they would rather vote for a stone instead of the CCM 'In your day, popularity was based on good deeds' Steve Ole Moruo complained:
#DearNyerere, in your day, popularity was based on good deeds towards your country, but nowadays it is the number of followers on Instagram and Twitter.
David Nguma noted:
#DearNyerere, the opposition parties are using your quotes .
CCM is ashamed of quoting you in their campaigns because they have betrayed you.
Albert Secha wished:
#DearNyerere ungerudi uiongoze Tz hata for a year! just one year! .. We miss your integrity! — Albert Secha (@SechaAlbert) October 14, 2015
Just one year!...We miss your integrity! The Van Official tweeted about animal smuggling in the country:
#DearNyerere, you left us with elephants which are no more, giraffes are "boarding aeroplanes" .
Tanzania has banned wildlife exports after about 130 animals and birds, including giraffes, were smuggled out of the country.
The wildlife was flown out in a cargo plane from Tanzania to Qatar.
Regarding the general election, Othman observed:
#DearNyerere, even if you were around, you were not going to be the reason for Tanzanians to love CCM
Tanzania will only get better'
Not all Twitter users are using the hashtag to complain about the state of affairs in the country.
Michael Paul Baruti, for example, tweeted:
We still here, stronger than ever.. Transparency and accountability are starting to prevail...
Tanzania will only get better... #DearNyerere — Michael Paul Baruti (@michaelbaruti) October 14, 2015 While Kibibi wrote: #DearNyerere, our country keeps progressing
Read this interview of Nyerere, conducted by Ikaweba Bunting when he was still alive, to learn more about the vision Nyerere had for Tanzania.
"Oplan Bayanihan pushes Lumads to evacuate their lands, but also paves the way for corporations to take hold of the land, and use the Armed Forces of the Philippines as their own security force as they plunder and suck the Earth of its natural elements." Image and caption by Anakbayan USA.Reacting to reports that paramilitary activities and mining operations are displacing Lumad tribes, many Filipinos have called for urgent government action to stop the violence against the indigenous peoples.
Lumad is a collective term referring to the indigenous tribes in Mindanao, the Philippines’ second biggest island located in the southern part of the country.
Lumad leaders from Surigao province reported that paramilitary groups have attacked their schools and communities, forcing more than 2,000 people to leave their homes in the mountains and seek shelter in the city center.
Many came from Lumad communities which have actively resisted the entry of mining companies.
The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), a government agency, described the violence against the Lumad as an attack on Philippine culture:
The NCCA recognizes these indigenous peoples and their leaders as the core and the backbone of the country’s intangible cultural heritage.
They are the bearers of our unique artistic traditions.
Their murder is the murder of our peoples’ soul.
As the living transmitters of time-tested knowledge systems, skills and practices, to wound them is to damage the cultural basis for the sustainable development of our nation.
For several days in September, the Twitter hashtag #StopLumadKillings‬‬ trended in the Philippines when Filipino netizens turned to social media to express their solidarity with the displaced Lumad.
Below are some photos and memes showing support for the Lumad:
The banner reflects the stand of the Catholic Church in Tandag City where more than 2,000 Lumad evacuees have sought shelter.

‪The United Nations Special Rapporteurs on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, and on the situation of human rights defenders, Michel Forst urged the military to end its occupation of some tribal schools:‬
Military occupation of civilian institutions and killing of civilians, particularly in places such as schools which should remain safe havens for children from this type of violence, are unacceptable, deplorable and contrary to international human rights and international humanitarian standards
For its part, the military has denied that it organized paramilitary groups to harass the Lumad communities.
It insisted that tribal war was the cause of violence in the Lumad areas.
But the governor of the province disputed this and accused the military of creating and arming the paramilitary groups.
The Philippines senate has committed to investigating the issue.

Bassel Safadi has been imprisoned in Syria for almost four years and friends and activists fear for his life after he was transferred from his prison today to an unknown location
Activists are calling upon the Syrian government to immediately release imprisoned Syrian-Palestinian software engineer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, after he was moved from his prison to an unknown location earlier today.
Safadi, who has been in prison for almost four years, is also a well-known open-source software developer.
He is a Creative Commons leader in Syria and active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, and is credited with opening up the Syrian Internet and extending online access and knowledge to the public.
According to the European Parliament, his detention is part of Syrian government efforts to restrict access to online communities and stifle freedom of expression in the country.
According to a Facebook page set up by supporters calling for his release:
Bassel was transferred from Adra prison to an unknown location after a patrol, whose affiliation is not known, came to him and asked him to gather his things.
It is expected that he has been transferred to the civil court headquarters at the Military Police in Al Qaboun area.
We are worried and fear for Bassel after his whereabouts are unknown again
Khartabil was arrested on March 15, 2012, on the first anniversary of the start of the Syrian revolution.
He was interrogated and tortured for five days by Military Branch 215.
He was then transferred to the Interrogation Division Branch 248 and detained incommunicado for nine months.
On December 9, 2012, Khartabil was brought before a military prosecutor without an attorney present, and charged with "spying for an enemy State".
He was then sent to the Adra Prison in Damascus, where he has been held, until today.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) notes that:
It was Bassel's visibility as a technologist and activist that made him a target for detention.
An online petition, initiated by friend and campaigner Mohamed Najem, is available at Change.org calling for Khartabil's immediate release.
Please click the link to sign it.
Friend and freedom of speech campaigner Jillian C. York, who is also EFF Director for International Freedom of Expression, lends her support to the drive.
She tweets:

The Global Voices community demands justice for seven free expression advocates who are facing trial in Morocco due to their advocacy.
The seven advocates have sought to defend human rights, hold authorities accountable to the public, and uphold rule of law in their country.
Five have been charged with "threatening the internal security of the State" and two face charges of "receiving foreign funding without notifying the General Secretariat of the government."
We call on the Moroccan government to stand by its commitments to international human rights agreements and drop all charges against these seven individuals.
Hisham Almiraat at the Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, 2012.
Among those charged is Hisham Almiraat, a medical doctor and long-time member of our community.
We cannot remain silent in the face of this threat to our friend.
Hisham has had a leading voice in Morocco’s blogosphere for nearly a decade.
He co-founded citizen media projects Talk Morocco and Mamfakinch, and served as Global Voices’ advocacy director.
Balancing profession and passion, Hisham has spent many years working to improve the lives and well-being of Moroccans, both as a civil society advocate and as a medical doctor.
Like other media and human rights groups around the world, we fear that this case represents an attempt by the Moroccan government to silence those who are critical of its policies and practices.
We see this not only as a threat to our friend and colleague, but also to our broader mission.
As a community of bloggers and activists from over 160 countries, we invoke the universal human right to free expression each day, as we tell stories from underrepresented communities around the world.
We call on allies to support our message, and on foreign governments to hold the Moroccan government to account on its actions and principles. #Justice4Morocco

Some bodies are global, but most bodies remain local, regional, "ethnic."'
In this episode of GV Face, the Global Voices Hangout series, Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese blogger and Global Voices contributor, Lova Rakotomalala, our Paris-based French language editor and Laura Vidal, our Paris-based Latin America community manager talk about race, the politics of death and the unequal reactions to tragedies around the world.
Global Voices is a border-less, largely volunteer community of more than 1400 writers, analysts, online media experts and translators.
We set a news agenda that builds bridges, global understanding and friendship across borders.
We focus on telling stories from marginalized and misrepresented communities.
Our translators render these stories into more than 35 languages.
Many of our community members speak multiple languages and call more than one city and country their home.
After the Paris attacks on November 13, Joey wrote a post titled, "The Streets of Paris Are as Familiar to Me as the Streets of Beirut", which went viral:
I come from a privileged Francophone community in Lebanon.
This has meant that I have always seen France as my second home.
The streets of Paris are as familiar to me as the streets of Beirut.
I was just in Paris a few days ago.
These have been two horrible nights of violence.
The first took the lives of over 40 in Beirut; the second took the lives of over 120 people and counting in Paris.
It also seems clear to me that to the world, my people’s deaths in Beirut do not matter as much as my other people’s deaths in Paris.
We do not get a “safe” button on Facebook.
We do not get late night statements from the most powerful men and women alive and millions of online users.
We do not change policies which will affect the lives of countless innocent refugees.
This could not be clearer.
I say this with no resentment whatsoever, just sadness.
Laura Vidal was a block away at a bar when the first attack took place at a restaurant on November 13 in Paris.
Laura moved to Paris seven years ago from Venezuela as a student.
In, "After the Paris Attacks: For It to Be Unity, It Can't Be Partial", she reflects:
Since I arrived in Paris I’ve followed the endless discussions on origins, skin colours, backgrounds and religious faiths.
Part of my research work is based on—of all subjects—intercultural sensitivity.
These conversations are emotional, and therefore uncomfortable. But they’re necessary.
And I say this because it seems that dividing the world between “us” and “them” isn’t useful.
And it never has been.
In fact, the artificial creation of difference is what fuels all of this.
And this is how we learn to see “ourselves” and “others”, and this is the lens through which we have studied history and watch the news.
“Us” and “them”.
“Here” and “far away”.
I don’t think we can afford to keep this view of the world anymore—assuming we ever could—and maintain this denial of reality.
Lova's essay, "Creating a Media of Empathy One Letter at a Time", published after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, co-authored with Global Voices Nigeria contributor Nwachukwu Egbunike:
The time to have a global discussion on terror attacks, free speech, empathy and Islamophobia is not when tragedy strikes but beforehand and when cooler heads prevail.
Yet, whether we like it or not, the public thirst to make sense of the world is highest when such sad events occur.
The timing might not be ideal, but we have the opportunity as media contributors to reframe the conversation for thousand of readers all over the world, while they are paying attention.

In an announcement from the United Nation mission in Iran, the Iranian government will include all of its registered refugees into its Salamat Insurance Scheme.
This is a collaboration between the Ministry of Interior, responsible for immigrant affairs, the Iranian Health Insurance Organization and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
This plan is targeted at Iran's Afghan and Iraqi refugee population.
Iran's English daily Tehran Times, part of the Mehr News Agency owned by the Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organisation, described the "gratitude" of Sivanka Dhanapala, the UNHCR Representative in Iran, for the program:
UNHCR’s Representative in Iran acknowledged the Iranian Government’s contribution, expressed UNHCR’s gratitude towards the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for all the services it has rendered to the largest protracted urban refugee population in the world for over three decades, and inclusion of the refugees in this Universal Insurance Scheme which is exemplary not only regionally but also globally, and added that such a services haven’t been provided before and I sincerely hope other countries will follow this example.
Half of the coverage for the program will come from the Iranian government, while the UNHCR will contribute with US $8.3 million.
The program will be available to all registered refugees, who will receive access to a health insurance package for "hospitalization and temporary hospitalization", as available to Iranian nationals.
According to the UNHCR website, Iran is home to one of "the world's largest and most protracted refugee populations."
Iran's Afghan refugee population nears 1 million, with an additional estimated 1.4 to 2 million unregistered refugees living and working in the country.
Iran's treatment of this demographic has been subject to past criticism, however, most notable in the 2013 Human Rights Watch report that detailed the mistreatment and sometimes abuse Afghans faced from both Iranian society and the government.
For their 2015 projection, the UNHCR detailed their expectations for Iran's intake for mostly Afghan, Iraqi and Pakistani refugees as outlined in the image below.
Chart from UNHCR country operations profile.
Iran has been criticized for not taking in any Syrian refugees throughout the civil war there.
This reproach comes amidst the fact that it is heavily involved in the Syrian conflict as an ally and supporter of the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.
Indeed, this development in instating universal public healthcare for refugee populations is a notable milestone for both Iran and the region.
Iran can, however, still improve its image in bolstering its role in alleviating the neighbouring Syrian refugee crisis.
Lumad leaders display banner calling for the protection of their communities as they march towards Manila.
Photo from the Facebook page of ST Exposure
Over 700 Lumad (indigenous peoples from the southern Philippine island of Mindanao) traveled thousands of kilometers and set up protest camps in the nation's capital of Manila in October 2015 to demand the removal of troops and paramilitary forces from their communities.
Dubbed the Manilakbayan 2015, the people’s caravan also seeks public support to end the human rights abuses committed by state forces against the Lumad.
Testimonies from some of the Lumad were shared on Facebook by multimedia group Southern Tagalog Exposure.
The hashtag #StopLumadKillings trended in the Philippines after the gruesome murders of Lumad community school head Emerito Samarca and two indigenous leaders Dionel Campos and Bello Sinzo last September 1, 2015.
This was the most high-profile case in what activists claim is a systematic campaign of repression against indigenous peoples in Mindanao, including the targeting of their leaders for assassinations, the closing of indigenous schools, and the military occupation of their homelands.
Lumad organizations explain that they are being targeted at the behest of large-scale mining, plantations, and other companies salivating over the resource-rich Lumad lands.
The armed forces of the Philippines is also accused of arming and training Lumad paramilitaries to fight their own kin.
The militarization of indigenous communities has led to massive evacuations of thousands of Lumad across Mindanao.
These brief statements gathered by Southern Tagalog Exposure bear witness to the intense militarization of indigenous communities and plunder of their ancestral lands.
"Our ancestral lands are being forcibly taken from us.
We want to drive the soldiers away and dismantle the paramilitary groups dividing the ranks of us Lumad.
We want to live in peace."
Bai Bibiaon Ligkaian Bigkal, Woman Warrior of Tala-ingod, Davao del Norte
“Soldiers massacred our tribe.
The government and corporations prioritize personal interests, not the interests of the people.
The people are not important to them.
When we defend our ancestral land and culture, they accuse us of being part of New People's Army to justify abductions or murders.”
Kaylo, Manobo of Talaingod, Davao del Norte
"Because of the repression of the soldiers, we were forced to evacuate and leave our land.
To be displaced is difficult, with the heat and no water.
We want to return to our land.
I vowed to myself as a Lumad since childhood to continue our fight until I die."
Krstina Lantao, Southern Mindanao Region
“The Philippine Army destroyed our school.
They even burned our agricultural cooperative.
I experienced getting jailed and now face trumped-up charges of kidnapping.
We miss our ancestral land.
Wherever we go, we yearn for it.
This is where we live and grew up.
If it is taken from us, our culture will die with the next generation.”
Datu Isidro, Kitaotao, Bukidnon
“The helicopter of the soldiers arrived at our place.
They burned our house. Only the clothes we wore were saved. According to the soldiers, the Lumad are not allowed to study.
When I grow up, I want to be a teacher to prove them wrong.”
Kimkim Baliti, 13-year-old Manobo, Talaingod, Davao del Norte
“"We will not die in the jungles, but instead will die from the open pit mining.
We should be the ones benefiting from the wealth of Mindanao. The soldiers say we are New People's Army to justify our displacement and murder.
They should be the ones who must go because they are outsiders to our ancestral land.”
Jean Derong, Manobo, Davao Oriental
“The role of women in the struggle of the native Lumad is important.
Our respect for each other is high.
We need to collectively defend our human rights and our ancestral land.”

Amin Anvary's mother Farah Bakhshi in a protest for her son's release.
Image from ICHRI.
Student activist Amin Anvari, 21, who received a suspended prison sentence earlier this year for Facebook postings promoting basic civil liberties, has been arrested and held without charge at Evin Prison’s Ward 2-A by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards since 4 October, 2015.
According to a family member, he has been under intense pressure to make false confessions.
“They are threatening us and harassing us just to put pressure on Amin in prison.
I’m sure of that.
They want him to agree to confess to lies,” Amin Anvari’s mother, Farah Bakhshi, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.
Amin Anvari was first arrested on 30 December, 2014, because of his Facebook posts on basic civil rights.
He was released the same day on a 300 million-rial (approximately USD $10,000) bond.
In July 2015, he was tried at Branch 26 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court presided by Judge Ahmadzadeh and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for “propaganda against the state,” “insulting the Supreme Leader,” and “insulting Mohammad Taghi Mesbagh Yazdi”, who is a member of the Council of Experts.
But his sentence was suspended for five years.
Ms. Bakhshi recalled that her son Amin was arrested again on 4 October by ten men who stormed into their home without showing identification or warrants and confiscated his personal computers.
Since then she has only been able to have three brief phone conversations with him.
She, her husband, and her younger son have been harassed and warned not to give interviews about Amin’s arrest.
“Anything that happens to my two children, myself and my husband will be the responsibility of the Revolutionary Guards.
They are threatening us so that I don’t protest or give interviews.
But I have no other choice.
You want me not to give interviews?
For God’s sake release my son and then I’ll be quiet,” Ms. Bakhshi said.
Ms. Bakhshi relayed to the Campaign how an official at Evin Prison tried to pressure her not to speak with media:
He told me he would let me see my son if I promised not to give interviews or join protests.
I said I would agree, if he promised to release my son.
He said no, and I said 'well, then I will continue to do what I’m doing.'
Amin Anvari’s mother added that she was silent for two weeks after her son’s arrest.
But on 19 October, she joined a protest gathering by a group of prisoners’ families.
“That same day Amin phoned our home and spoke to his father and said he was well and said ‘Tell mother not to give interviews because it will cause problems ’.”
Ms. Bakhshi said during this summer’s annual family visit to Turkey they discovered that some of Amin’s friends had been arrested.
She told him not to return to Iran if he thought there might be a problem.
But he said he had done nothing wrong and wanted to return to his university studies, Ms. Bakhshi added.
“My plea to the judicial officials is that they should not arrest youths and pass heavy judgments against them every time they criticize.
My son should be sitting in class and studying right now.”

Over the past 40 years, Filipino artist Federico Boyd Sulapas Dominguez has been painting the efforts of indigenous peoples to combat destructive mining, development aggression, and militarization.
His aim is to enlighten the public about the situation of ethnic groups in the Philippines and their campaign for the protection of their ancestral lands.
The Philippines has more 14 million indigenous peoples belonging to 110 ethno-linguistic groups.
However, the unique heritage of these tribes is threatened by rapid urbanization, commercialization, and encroachment of their lands by state-approved activities such as agribusiness ventures, logging, and mining.
In Mindanao Island, located in the southern part of the country, the collective term for ethnic groups is Lumad.
Various lumad groups which are resisting the entry of mining firms into their communities has been in the news during September and October 2015 after they were attacked by paramilitary groups.
About 700 Lumad members have set up camps in Manila, the nation’s capital, to demand the pull-out of troops from their homes.
The plight of the Lumad is reflected in many of Federico's artworks.
He has also been uploading copies of his old paintings on Facebook which he thinks are still relevant because of the attacks on Lumad communities and the continued plunder of natural resources in the ancestral domains of ethnic tribes.
Some of his paintings have been widely shared on social media by activists, scholars, and heritage advocates who are seeking to inspire the public to support the Lumad’s right to self-determination.
Federico, who is a Mandaya (Lumad indigenous people from the eastern part of Mindanao), encourages younger artists to enrich their knowledge of Philippine culture by integrating with ethnic communities.
Below are some of Federico’s paintings:

Aside from exposing the negative impact of militarization, the painting also shows how government laws unfairly discriminate against the Philippines' ethnic communities.

"Lupa ay Buhay" means "Land is Life".
"Kapayapaan" means peace.
The text at the borders of the painting reads: Respect the rights of indigenous peoples and their right to self-determination.

Memes widely shared in solidarity with the victims of the Paris attacks.
I come from a privileged Francophone community in Lebanon.
This has meant that I have always seen France as my second home.
The streets of Paris are as familiar to me as the streets of Beirut.
I was just in Paris a few days ago.
These have been two horrible nights of violence.
The first took the lives of over 40 in Beirut; the second took the lives of over 120 people and counting in Paris.
It also seems clear to me that to the world, my people’s deaths in Beirut do not matter as much as my other people’s deaths in Paris.
We do not get a "safe" button on Facebook.
We do not get late night statements from the most powerful men and women alive and millions of online users.
We do not change policies which will affect the lives of countless innocent refugees.
This could not be clearer.
I say this with no resentment whatsoever, just sadness.
It is a hard thing to realize that for all that was said, for all the progressive rhetoric we have managed to create as a seemingly united human voice, most of us members of this curious species are still excluded from the dominant concerns of the "world".
And I know that by "world", I am myself excluding most of the world.
Because that’s how power structures work.
I do not matter.
My "body" does not matter to the "world".
If I die, it will not make a difference.
Again, I say this with no resentment.
That statement is merely a fact.
It is a political fact, true, but a fact nonetheless.
Maybe I should have some resentment in me, but I am too tired.
It is a heavy thing to realize.
I know that I am fortunate enough that when I do die, I will be remembered by friends and loved ones.
Maybe my blog and an online presence might even gather some thoughts by people around the world.
That is the beauty of the internet.
And even that is out of reach to too many.
Never so clearly as now have I understood what Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about when he spoke of the Black Body in America.
I think there is a story to be told of the Arab Body as well.
The Native American Body.
The Indigenous Body.
The Latin American Body.
The Indian Body.
The Kurdish Body.
The Pakistani Body.
The Chinese Body.
And so many other bodies.
The Human Body is not one.
It sure feels that it should be by now.
Maybe that in itself is an illusion.
But maybe it is an illusion worth preserving because without even that vague aspiration towards oneness on the part of some part of the body, I am not sure what sort of world we would be living in now.
Some bodies are global, but most bodies remain local, regional, "ethnic".
My thoughts are with all the victims of today’s and yesterday's horrific attacks, and my thoughts are with all those who will suffer serious discrimination as a result of the actions of a few mass murderers and the general failure of humanity’s imagination to see itself as a unified entity.
My only hope is that we can be strong enough to generate the opposite response to what these criminals intended.
I want to be optimistic enough to say that we are getting there, wherever "there" might be.
We need to talk about these things.
We need to talk about Race.
We just have to.

Tritha Sinha is a woman who's always known exactly what she wants.
"I always wanted to be free and not depend on my father for pocket money or eventually my boyfriends or brother and that sort of thing," she says.
Sinha is the driving force behind the New Delhi- and Paris-based band Tritha Electric.
She grew up in Kolkata and says, in India, the women around her weren't all that happy.
They were stifled.
"I had seen tears on faces of my aunts or mother, or just teachers randomly at school — and that made me feel that something is just not right."
Music, Tritha Sinha says, was her way out — a ticket to financial independence and liberation.
That independent streak started at a very young age.
Tritha Sinha was only 5 when she started singing.

She paid her way through college by singing in Bollywood movies.
But singing songs written by other people wasn't enough.
Oh no, she needed to write her own songs and front her own band.
That's where Tritha Electric comes in.
Sinha calls it ethno-punk music.
The ethno part is a nod to her classical Indian musical roots and the punk, she says, helps her express the struggles of being an independent woman in India today.
Tritha Electric's latest album is called Pagli.
That means "crazy woman" in Bengali.
And the songs on it tell the story of a woman who feels confined by tradition.
But she breaks the rules and finds freedom.
Much like Tritha Sinha herself.
She says, "To discover freedom sometimes we need to go through very crazy moments or insanity sometimes to just realize what is freedom or how important freedom can be for our individual deep inner selves.
And that really opened the door of my independent musical life."

On November 6, the Republic of Congo's President Denis Sassou-Nguesso claimed victory in a referendum staged to allow him to stand for election once again, anticipating moves by colleagues in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where long-serving presidents are all trying to change constitutions to extend their respective stays in power.
The call for the referendum was strongly contested by the political opposition, leading to several deaths at various protests in the streets of the capital, Brazzaville, during the week of the October 25 referendum.
Sassou-Nguesso was president of the People's Republic of Congo between 1979 and 1992 and has held the office in the renamed Republic of Congo from 1997.

Violent clashes at anti-referendum protests
The constitution of the Republic of Congo (also known as Congo-Brazzaville) limits the number of presidential terms to two, and sets the maximum age to stand for office at 70.
In early 2015, Sassou-Nguesso organised a series of consultations with some of the country's major political players to look into the possibility of modifying a constitution that has been in place since 2002.
This manoeuvre was the subject of severe criticism from a section of the opposition, who saw it as an attempt by the current president to stand for office a third time.
Sassou-Nguesso, nonetheless, went ahead with the referendum, asking the Congolese people if they would grant the amendments necessary for him to hold onto power.
Prior to the vote, the opposition called for a general boycott, and protests broke out against the president in several cities, notably Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire.
The authorities said four died and 10 were injured in violence during referendum week, as hashtags such as #Sassoufit (a play on words with the President's surname and the French for 'that's enough') and #Sassoudegage (Sassou out) trended on social media.
Despite a low turnout of 10% the referendum nevertheless returned a 'yes' victory, paving the way for Sassou-Nguesso's wished-for constitutional change.

What does the future hold for Congo-Brazzaville?
For the opposition the low turnout signalled the population's opposition to the constitutional reform.
Ismaël Bowend Nabole, a reporter at Brazzaville's Omega FM, noted that the Congolese opposition rejected the result:
One of the opposition's two major outlets has called the referendum a "constitutional coup" because the poll was neither free, fair, impartial nor transparent" and took place "under siege conditions".
The international community and electoral observers were also sceptical of the results.
Michel Taube, Director of the French-language current affairs website "l'Opinion Internationale" explained the position of the French government on the poll:
François Hollande, the French President, has distanced himself from Sassou-Nguesso.
After causing disappointment all over Africa with remarks made to the media the day before, the Elysée released a tardy statement saying that it "condemned any violence and supports freedom of expression. points out his speech in Dakar on the 29th November 2014 where he expressed his wish for all constitutions to be respected and for consultation of the electorate to take place under conditions of undisputed transparency."
Now it is clear from Sunday's constitutional referendum that Denis Sassou-Nguesso, doesn't respect the constitution nor can he offer undisputed transparency.
Taube added that this position will force government and opposition to dig their heels in as a political crisis continues to simmer in the country:
Let's not forget: some hours before being ousted, Ben Ali of Tunisia and Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso did not suspect that democracy would triumph over an all-powerful statesman.
Young people in the Republic of Congo remain hopeful for the future, if deeply distrustful of the various political interests at play in the country.
A trio of students, Josué Mfutila Kiangata, Aaron Malu Mukeba and Martin Nomapungu gave African news portal Waza Online their views on events in the country.
Martin:
Some candidates proclaim victory before the elections; they imply that the heads of the institutions which run the elections are obedient.
Yet these institutions should be neutral and independent.
They are bodies made up of politicians; they come with their political allegiances.
Aaron:
I think that democratic principles are universal and that we are supposed to abide by them.
I am not with those people who think that the African hereditary system of the olden days was a good system.
Josué:
Literature teaches us that we should organise elections against a peaceful backdrop.
But here in Africa it doesn't work like that.
Why?
Because it is a borrowed culture, a culture for Westerners that people have come to impose on Africa.
Zone9 bloggers, together after their release.

In the wake of their acquittal and release from prison, Ethiopia's Zone9 bloggers reflect on their experience and thank their supporters.
The bloggers were arrested in April of 2014 and prosecuted under Ethiopia's Anti-Terrorism Act.
Five members of the group were released in July of 2015 and the remaining four were acquitted and released during the week of October 19, 2015.
Learn more about their case.
This post was collectively written by Zone9 and translated from Amharic to English by Endalk Chala.
Our release was as surprising as our detention.
Five of us were released after our charges were "withdrawn" in July.
The remaining four of us were released in October because we were acquitted (save for the appeal against our acquittal).
Still one member of our group, Befeqadu, was released on bail and must defend himself later this year in December.
Even though we were released in different circumstances, one thing makes all of us similar – our strong belief that we didn’t deserve even a single day of arrest.
Yes, it is good to be released, but we were arrested undeservedly.
All we did was write and strive for the rule of law because we want to see the improvement of our country and the lives of its citizens.
However, writing and dreaming for the better of our nation got us detained, harassed, tortured and exiled.
Undeservedly.
...writing and dreaming for the better of our nation got us detained, harassed, tortured and exiled.
Undeservedly.
It makes us happy when we hear people say they are inspired by our story.
But it also makes us sad when we learn people are scared to write because they have seen what we have gone through for our writings.
Our incarceration makes us experience happiness and grief at the same time.
The bottom line is that it is good to know we have inspired people while it is saddening that people have left the public discourse as a result of our detention.
It is sad to know that our detention has had a chilling effect on public discourse.
We are victims of institutionalized misconduct.
But this does not lie not beyond our ability to forgive.
To our incarcerators who gave us those ordeals, even if you are not asking us for forgiveness, here we are.
Our incarceration made us feel our lives pass by us.
It is true we have missed and lost things.
But we also have increased our learning curve.
We have learned a lot.
Our detention tells a broader story of our country.
We were able to witness the price of freedom of expression is dearly expensive.
We are firsthand witnesses of injustice.
More than anything, we have learned that a nation which is rampant with injustice is the foremost enemy of its law abiding citizens.
We are victims of institutionalized misconduct.
But this does not lie not beyond our ability to forgive.
To our incarcerators who gave us those ordeals, even if you are not asking us for our forgiveness, here we are.
And please forgive us, for we are law abiding citizens who refuse to live on your terms.
For all people who were with us both in good times and in bad times, those of you who stood by us not only in our successes but also in our failures, YOU are awesome! You are our friends, you are our family, you were our lawyers, you campaigned for us, and you defended our cause.
Thank you!
Thank you!
You all deserve our heartfelt gratitude for your actions reduced the length of our prison time and eased our boredom while we were in prison.

Afghan school children in Iran have been the subject of abuse and mistreatment.
Photo from ICHRI and used with permission.
On January 5, 2016 Shargh newspaper reported that the principal of a school in Damavand beat five young Afghan students with a hose and left marks on their faces and bodies, telling them, “You Afghans have to leave.
There are too many of you.” Afghan students are being subjected to physical punishment and discrimination in Iranian schools, according to media reports in Iran that the government has tried to suppress.
“News about abused students in general, and Afghan students in particular, only pop up in the media by accident because the monitoring agencies and the Education Ministry try to suppress these incidents,” Shirzad Abdollahi, an expert in Iranian educational affairs, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.
Iran is host to one of the largest refugee populations in the world, with 950,000 Afghans registered in 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The mistreatment of Iranian children in schools, whether it is bodily punishment or verbal abuse and humiliation, is common in Iran, according to Abdollahi, but it is worse for Afghan children because they have fewer protections.
The educational system tends to deal with these incidents without punishing abusive staff, and they try to hide it from the press, he told the Campaign.
Many undocumented Afghan children also face bureaucratic obstacles that prevent them from attending school, a violation of international law that guarantees the right to education.
An Afghan student from the city of Pakdasht was beaten and expelled from school for not paying tuition, according to the most recent report appearing January 16, 2016 in the Vaghaye Ettefaghiehnewspaper.
The parents were only able to afford one million rials (about $33) of the 2.3 million rials ($76) demanded by the school.
The student was told not to come back to school until tuition was paid in full.
Following the January incident in Damavand, one of the parents told Sharg newspaper,
We went and complained to the district’s school administration and they sent an investigator to the school.
But after all that, the school’s headmaster told us it was better not to drag things out further...He said our kids were being rowdy and they caused the principal to get angry.
Last year a teacher from another school in Pakdasht punished four Afghan elementary students by forcing them to put their hands inside a toilet, according to a February 10, 2015 report from Tabnaknews.
“The mistreatment of Afghan students is not systematic within the educational system but rather it’s at the school level, depending on the personal beliefs of the headmasters, principals or teachers,” Abdollahi told the Campaign.
Teachers and administrators are not sufficiently trained about children’s rights, he added.
In the short-term, there should be better monitoring of headmasters and teachers and any violations should be countered with greater firmness..Honorable teachers, who are more than a few, should stand up to colleagues who are abusive...The media should also raise awareness about the rights of children and make society more sensitive towards the mistreatment of students.
“There’s no official directive condoning physical violence against Afghan students.
The problem is society’s views,” Abdollahi told the Campaign.
“A few years ago a group of families in Tehran’s Kan district rallied in front of their neighborhood school to stop Afghan students from enrolling there,” he said.
In addition to physical abuse and discrimination, Afghan students are also financially more vulnerable because their parents, most of whom are refugees, often earn less than average Iranians.
“Since last year, the tuition issue has been somewhat resolved and schools are no longer required to demand tuition from Afghan students,” said Abdollahi.
“They may be asked to make voluntary contributions for certain school expenses, but it’s not clear what’s voluntary and what’s not.”
“Nevertheless, regulations state that Afghan students have the same rights as their Iranian classmates and no one has the right to mistreat them,” he said.
In 2011, the Education Ministry’s international affairs deputy announced that foreign students were banned from enrolling in special schools for the gifted, as well as in exemplary public schools and vocational schools, a violation of the internationally guaranteed right to higher education.
“Educational policies should not be subject to seasonal changes in taste or governments.
Education is a recognized children’s right regardless of nationality, ethnicity, residency status or financial means,” Abdollahi told the Campaign.
“This right must be completely respected without any impact from changing governments and policies,” he said.
Abdullah Hassan, known as Fish, lived at the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya for 23 years.

This article by Rachel Gotbaum for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on February 18, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Abdullah Hassan, whose nickname is Fish, was 7 years old when his father was murdered by militants in Somalia.
He then left Somalia and traveled to Kenya, to the Dadaab refugee camp.
Along the way two of Hassan's brothers and his sister died of malnutrition.
When he and his mother arrived at the camp the conditions there weren't much better.
The camp was created in 1992 to house 90,000 Somalis escaping their civil war.
To this day, there is little plumbing or running water, and the UN Refugee Agency often cuts the already minimal food rations.
Many refugees have died of hunger.
There are also cholera outbreaks because of massive flooding and little sanitation.
Fish's wife died of an ulcer due to lack of proper medical care.
Fish's work with the Danish Refugee Council is considered volunteerism due to his refugee status.

The refugees are not allowed to work and very few are allowed to leave.
Fish works for the Danish Refugee Council, but it's not a job in the traditional sense: the agency provides Fish with a stipend, and considers him a volunteer.
The Dadaab camp now houses 500,000 people and is a ramshackle city the size of New Orleans.
Recently the militant group Al Shabaab has penetrated the camp.
"We experienced severe violent activities, kidnappings, shootings, killings, there were a lot of vehicles bombed," says Hassan.
"My colleagues in the community were killed."
Fish was also targeted and had to leave for Nairobi, where he is now living illegally.
He is often stopped by police and must offer them bribes to avoid arrest.
After feeling trapped at Dadaab and in Kenya for 23 years, Fish hopes to resettle somewhere less hostile with his daughters, who still live at the camp.
He hopes to make a new life.
“I’m optimistic that I may go out of this country Kenya and get resettled," he says.
"It’s just about time that God has a solution for me.”
Fish is profiled in the new book "City of Thorns" by Ben Rawlence.

Blogging is bad for your back .. in Saudi Arabia.
Image used as part of an Amnesty International campaign to draw attention to the plight of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes in Saudi Arabia in 2014 for setting up a "liberal" website
Saudi Arabia has sentenced a Twitter user to 10 years in prison in addition to 2,000 lashes for publishing 600 tweets "which spread atheism" on the micro-blogging site.
According to Saudi daily Al Watan the Twitter user, whose name was not disclosed, was sentenced by a court in Medina which found him guilty of denying the existence of God and holy scriptures, accusing prophets of lying and also ridiculing the Holy Quran.
He was also fined 20,000 Riyals (5,300 US dollars).
The man was arrested after the Information Crimes Prevention Unit at the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice or Saudi Arabia's religious police started monitoring his Twitter account.
The newspaper adds that the man, aged 28, confessed his atheist beliefs in court and refused all attempts to make him repent, citing his right to freedom of speech.
He added that he was previously a Muslim, and has now renounced all religions after communicating with websites which spread atheism on the Internet.
The court, added the newspaper, proved the accusations against the man based on his confessions and the testimony of four men who said they found the Twitter account on the man's mobile phone, and it was proved that the service operating the phone was under his name.
The sentence was met by a muted response online, with many just exchanging links to news stories without much commentary on it.
Abdulrahman, from Egypt, warns Saudi Twitter users:
This is Saudi Arabia.
A 28-year-old Saudi man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, 2,000 lashes and a 20,000 Riyal fine for atheism on Twitter.
Users of social media in Saudi Arabia should be careful.
You are being watched, persecuted and threatened.
A simple tweet could threaten your life.
What a society of ignorance and backwardness!
According to a 2001 Saudi law, "anything contravening a fundamental principle or legislation, or infringing the sanctity of Islam and its benevolent Shari’ah, or breaching public decency" is punishable by law.
In 2014, the conservative kingdom, issued drastic laws which, according to Human Rights Watch, criminalises "virtually all dissident thought or expression as terrorism."
Article 1 of the law describes as terrorism those:
“Calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based.”
In May 2014, a criminal court in Jeddah sentenced blogger Raif Badawi to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for “insulting Islam”.
Badawi was prosecuted for developing “Saudi Arabian Liberals”, an online forum he launched in 2008 debating the role of religion in the country.
The then 32-year-old was also ordered to pay a one million riyals fine (approximately US$266,600).
Despite an international campaign calling for his release, Badawi is still in prison today.
In January 2015, he was flogged 50 out of the scheduled 1,000 lashes.
His second flogging has been postponed due to Badawi's poor health.
Michael Niyitegeka, a respected authority on social media in Uganda.
Photo from his official Twitter account, @niyimic
On February 18, Uganda goes to the polls.
Like many countries around the world, social media has become part and parcel of political communication and conversation in Uganda.
For example, social media played a significant role during the first ever presidential debate on January 15.
The hashtag #UGDebate16 trended throughout the debate.
Ugandans like never before use social media tools to engage in election-related chatter.
According to the Uganda Communication Commission, Uganda had over 11 million Internet users as of March 2015 and 1.8 million Facebook subscribers in the country of over 37 million as of Novembers 2015, while mobile subscriptions are estimated to be 19 million.
I spoke with Michael Niyitegeka, an accreditation consultant and an authority on social media in Uganda, to discuss the role that social media has played in this election season.
Prudence Nyamishana (PN): What has the role of social media been in this year's election in Uganda?
Michael Niyitegeka (MN): Social media has taken a role that nobody anticipated it would have.
Out of the blue, there is a lot of attention from all the political actors and players.
It's like they have woken up to the reality that social media is not something that they can take for granted.
And so there has been a lot of investment, a lot of people hired to run social media campaigns and candidates’ pages.
Therefore, the relevance and importance of social media in Uganda has gone to a different level.
On the other hand, there has been what I can call amateurism because the people who hired and were hired to conduct social media campaign did not come up with clear strategies at the beginning of the campaign.
As a result, some started strong and died out, others gained momentum as a the campaigns went on, but if they had planned in advance the aspirants would have had better mileage on social media.
Social media users in Uganda have also evolved and the number has increased.
For example the number of people that have just joined Twitter during the campaign season is massive.
Social media has claimed a position that it didn’t have in the beginning- it has become more important and more critical.
People share real-time photos that caused some camps to 'Photoshop' crowds to give the impression to voters that they have support.
Social media has elevated some political personalities and events such as the presidential debate, which was closely followed and intensely debated by Ugandans because of social media.
PN: Do you think Ugandans have successfully engaged with the presidential candidates on social media?
MN: From my observation, I think one or two presidential candidates are tweeting for themselves, the rest have hired social media teams.
The candidates come up with a social media team, who come up with a Twitter handle and a Facebook page.
They basically run the campaigns on behalf of the candidate.
You don’t get the feel of the natural person, the actual candidate behind the Twitter handle but more of a robot tweeting on what the candidate is doing.
Have we been able to engage the camps from a machinery perspective?
National Resistance Movement, the ruling party, has tried to organise Twitter chats but it’s also not consistent and people are not paying attention to them in terms of engagements.
For instance, when the party hosted Hon Rebecca Kadaga, the first female Speaker of Parliament in Uganda, people were just tweeting what Kadaga was saying but it would have made more sense if Kadaga was the one tweeting and having a conversation with social media users.
I am sure this would have been different.
So social media engagement is something that political camps jumped on, but I don’t think that it is something that they seriously made strategies for.
A screenshot of the official Twitter page for Uganda Presidential Debate.
The event was one of the most tweeted election-related event in Uganda's political history.
PN: What has been the place of social media as a propaganda tool in this election season?
MN: Freedom of expression comes with responsibility to it.
There are instances of irresponsible reporting and commenting on social media.
Candidates have an obligation to be mature and responsible enough when saying things because they are not just communicating to their supporters, but to wider audiences.
So different political parties should be responsible when putting out information, For example, when the ruling party secretary was recorded saying that those that cause confusion would have their children killed, people recorded the message and shared it widely.
We, the users, should also be responsible and verify information before sharing it because unverified information can easily lead to chaos and political violence.
PN: How do we score in terms of freedom of expression online?
MN: I think Ugandans still enjoy, to a greater extent, freedom of expression online.
And I believe we cannot reach the levels of countries like Thailand that suppress media freedom online.
With the amount of liberty and freedom Ugandans enjoy on social media have, nipping it up would be a difficult task.
You would just have to have shut down the Internet.
PN: What role is social media going to play in terms of monitoring and observation on election day?
MN: There is a side of me that thinks that the Internet is going to slow down.
That’s just me.
Because you see if you are the person in charge and things are not going on as expected, a couple of things might happen.
But with this wide-spread Internet, it is going to be difficult to do anything stupid.
For instance there is a police truck in Mbale, a town in eastern Uganda, that was ferrying ruling party supporters, I don’t think in their wildest imagination they would have taken a photo and shared it as netizens did.
There was another incident when someone from the ruling party was trying to claim on Twitter that the opposition Forum for Democratic Change ferries people to its rallies but people came out and blasted him.
To counter his claim, social media users displayed multiple shots of the incident which showed that there were in fact cows in the truck.
So anybody who is participating in this election has to be extremely careful.
PN: What do you think will be the role of social media post-election, in terms of civic engagement?
MN: Social media is going to continue growing; the space is going to continue growing more than it was in the past five years.
We are going to have more leaders being held accountable though online activism, more people will pay attention to citizens' sentiments and concerns expressed online.
So social media is going to be an accountability tool.
I will see somebody doing something and I will take a photo and share knowing it will be picked up by many other concerned citizens.
PN: Do you have any final thoughts?
MN: As Ugandans on social media, we need to go beyond the semantics of followers, the semantics of the number of likes, we need to start digging deeper and deal with real issues in a more realist way and that is going to require much more than just having likes or followers.
It is important for us to look at analytics, collaborations, create valuable content for our followers.
We know governments, businesses and brands pay attention to social media.
Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore reacts to the news saying "Bring it on!"

Saudi Arabia's notorious religious police intend to give Professor Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, a run for his money.
Thirty members of the Commission for the Protection of Virtue and Prevention of Vice have just completed a five-day course which will enable to them to fight black magic, identify sorcerers and even break their spells.
Needless to say, practicing magic is strictly prohibited in the deeply conservative kingdom, where those convicted of witchcraft and sorcery are executed.
From the UAE, commentator Sultan Al Qassemi quips:
@jk_rowling Harry Potter and the Dark Kingdom.
Please make it happen.
But Hassan Cha says training the religious police is a "twisted version of Harry Potter":
Harry Potter aside, it seems that such training programmes have been ongoing for a while.
One user on Facebook shares a post from 2013 for a similar workshop.
In fact, combating sorcery is one of five main areas religious police should focus on in doing their work.
The other four are: "preserving Islam, preventing blackmail, fighting human trafficking, and ensuring that no one disobeys the country’s rulers."
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe turned 92 this month.
Public domain photo by the U.S. Air Force.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, nicknamed 'Uncle Bob', turned 92 on February 21.
He is the world's oldest president, holding office since 1987.
His time in the upper echelons of Zimbabwe's government isn't limited to his 30-year stint as president; he also was Zimbabwe's prime minister from 1980 to 1987.
According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch Mugabe's government regularly mistreats opposition politicians and their supporters, journalists, civil society activists and human rights defenders.
Human Rights Watch's World Report 2015 pointed out that, "The government of President Robert Mugabe continued to violate human rights in 2014 without regard to protections in the country’s new constitution.
An expected legislative framework and new or amended laws to improve human rights in line with the constitution never materialized."
Mugabe is also accused by Zimbabwe's opposition and the international community of systemic electoral fraud.
Online, Twitter users have been sharing facts about and quotes from a man known for his oratory skills, brashness, sense of humor, homophobia and hatred for the West.
"I have died many times.
I have actually beaten Jesus Christ because he only died once."
Robert Mugabe.

You set up the ICC , we set our ICC to try Europeans, to try Mr Bush and Mr Blair."

American journalist Anna Therese Day was arrested in Bahrain for covering protests to mark the fifth anniversary of Arab Spring-like protests which still continue.

American award winning journalist Anna Therese Day was arrested in Bahrain, along with three of her crew members, also American, for covering protests to mark the country's fifth anniversary of Arab Spring-like protests, which still continue today.
She was deported on February 16, along with her crew, after spending a day in detention.
The team was arrested during a demonstration in Sitra, and charged with taking part in an illegal protest and entering the country under a false pretext.
In a series of tweets, the Bahraini Ministry of Interior accuses Day and her crew of taking part in "illegal" protests:
Four Americans have been arrested after one of them was caught with his face covered during his participation with rioters in Sitra
The rest were arrested at a police checkpoint in the same area
Those arrested entered Bahrain on February 11 and 12 and presented wrong information to the concerned authorities claiming that they came to Bahrain for tourism
Those arrested worked in media without a permit in addition to committing acts which break the law.
Legal action has been taken against them and they have been referred to the public prosecutor.
Accusing journalists of breaking the law for covering news is not new to Bahrain.
More recently, photojournalist Ahmed Al Fardan was sentenced to three months in prison for taking photographs of protests.
He was charged with "intent" to protest.
Accusing journalists of taking part in protests was not lost on activists and friends who raised the alarm after Day's arrest.
On Twitter, journalist C. Robert Gibson appealed to his followers to make noise:
Bahrain detained my friend and colleague @ATDLive for the crime of journalism.
Share this far and wide: https://t.co/bZbN5m5qXz #FreeAnnaDay — C. Robert Gibson (@crgibs) February 16, 2016
Others, like Sally Kohn, called for Day's release under the hashtag #JournalismIsNotACrime:

Not only was she tortured for doing her work, but her torturers were acquitted.

The small island country of 1.3 million people (about half of whom are foreign workers) has been witnessing a brutal crackdown following a popular uprising, which began on 14 February 2011.
Activists have been tortured, killed or imprisoned.
Amnesty International, a leading human rights watchdog, released several reports ahead of the 14 February anniversary bringing attention to the dangerous reality in Bahrain for dissidents.
James Lynch, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, said:
Today in Bahrain, anyone who dares to criticize the authorities – whether a human rights defender or political activist – risks punishment Despite pledges from the authorities to prosecute security forces responsible for human rights violations in 2011, the Bahraini people are still waiting for justice.
Institutions set up to protect human rights have not only failed to independently investigate or hold perpetrators to account, but now increasingly appear to be used to whitewash continuing abuses.
Five years on, demonstrations continue, but are smaller and quieter.
Today, protesting, or rather “gathering”, is criminalized by law and villages are under day-and-night security watch.
Ugandans take to the polls, February 2016.

On February 18, Ugandans voted in presidential, parliamentary and local elections tainted by violence, protests, arrests and reports of rigging.
Ugandan and international observers have given a mixed opinion on the integrity of the vote, but one local organization, the Citizens’ Elections Observers Uganda, have discredited the whole exercise.
Provisional results show that the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, who is seeking to extend his 30-year rule with a fifth term in office, is leading with nearly 62 per cent of the vote.
Kizza Besigye, the main opposition candidate representing the Forum For Democratic Change (FDC), was arrested along with some of his officials when police stormed his party's headquarters, firing teargas and stun grenades.
Journalists who were live tweeting from the scene were also arrested.
In total, Besigye has been arrested three times this week alone.
There were protests outside the party's headquarters on Friday and some skirmishes were reported in different parts of the country over delay in declaring results.
Presidential elections in 2006 and 2011 were also marred by violence and public protests.
On election day, the Uganda Communications Commission blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp an hour after voting began, claiming that it was done in the interest of national security.
The services are still blocked.
Some bypassed the block using virtual private networks (VPNs), and once Ugandans were able to access social media, many published reports of what they were seeing.

Days before the vote, Besigye protesters and police clashed violently in Kampala.
One person was shot dead, and police fired canister after canister of tear gas to break up the gatherings.
Users discussed their upset with the situation.
Calling attention to the way the police and soldiers treated opposition politicians and their supporters, 'Cane cutter' wrote:

Journalist Sonny Serite.
Photo from from his Twitter account @kivuki.
Tenacious Botswana journalist Sonny Serite was arrested and charged March 17 with receiving stolen property in violation of the Botswana Penal Code.
Serite, who calls himself the "Bruce Lee of journalism", was allegedly caught by officials at the Office of President while receiving a confidential file for a corruption story he was working on.
Serite's defenders say he received the file, whose contents are not known yet, without knowing or having reason to believe it was unlawfully obtained or stolen from the Office of President.
It is believed the file may relate to a March 10 published story in the Botswana Gazette highlighting corruption in Botswana Railways' purchase of a rail passenger coach.
The journalist has since been denied bail as well as access to a lawyer.
The Botswana Media And Allied Workers Union (BOMAWU) has condemned his arrest and treatment.
Anti-corruption and freedom of speech activists are campaigning for his release on Twitter with the hashtag #FreeSonnySerite.
Is reporting a crime also a crime in Botswana?
Scores of supportive tweeps have leapt to the journalist's defence:
Knowing the truth about government becomes perilous.Reporting a crime is a crime in Botswana yet we preach #AntiCorruption #FreeSonnySerite — Mabena (@iam_mabena) March 18, 2016
How do you detain a journalist for exposing corruption smh #freesonnyserite — Goitse® (@geelek) March 18, 2016
Do you honestly believe the folks in power will just hand over these files?
No.
The system leaves journalists w/ no choice.#FreeSonnySerite — that circx dude (@Thabi_Kuswani) March 18, 2016
It is actually stupid to charge a journalist for receiving info, stolen or not.
Where do you think we get this info, idiot! #freeSonnySerite — thapeloNdlovu (@thapeloindlovu) March 19, 2016
What happened to Botswana's anti-corruption crusade?
Botswana is lauded as one of the least corrupt countries in Sub-Saharan Africa by organisations such as Transparency International.
The consulting firm Cushman & Wakefield released a report in 2015 titled Emerging & Frontier Markets which showed that Botswana is actually the most transparent emerging economy in Africa.
But Serite's arrest has caused some to revisit that praise:
#Botswana government arrests journalist digging into corruption.
Does it matter how journalists get hold of information to expose corruption?
On Facebook, Radifalana Turpelo Bobo Ronald was of the opinion that journalists should be able to get information by any means:
I still say where there is corruption, it has to be exposed.
Action taken against Serite are clear evidence that corruption indeed took place.
How he got the info doesn't matter, we need journalists like him who work tirelessly digging info about things that affects Botswana.
But others, such as Yusrah T Gareegope said Serite should answer before the law like anyone else:
detain Sonny Serite until you get whatever info you need from him, he's not the first nor the last to be detained nor is he special from all the other Botswanans who are always detained!
Sethamiso Moritshane noted:
He is just like any Botswanan who can commit crime , so what's special about him?

A compilation of some of Snoggie's work.
Uganda's recent elections were characterized by tension, arrests, and rigging allegations.
Not exactly a laughing matter, but there's still room for humor.
Just ask Snoggie, one of the country's leading political cartoonists, who regularly commented on these issues throughout the voting season.
Ugandans cast their ballots in presidential, parliamentary and local council elections on February 18, 2016.
The Electoral Commission of Uganda announced two days later that incumbent President Yoweri Museveni had won with 60.75% of the votes.
Main opposition candidate Kizza Besigye, who was arrested multiple times during the lead-up to the election, followed with 35.37%, and former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi came in third with 1.75%.
Snoogie shares his art in the Uganda's Daily Monitor newspaper as well as on his Facebook page, Snoggies World for Uganda, which has close to 30,000 followers.
His cartoons offer insight into the political drama playing out in Uganda at the moment.
Below are some of his works posted on his Facebook page.

The person in the driver's seat above is the chairman of the Electoral Commission, Badru Kiggundu.

After elections, there was a heavy police and military presence in the streets.
Unlike past elections, streets were empty of celebrations.

After years of environmental activism and fighting for indigenous communities, human rights champion Berta Caceres was assassinated in Honduras on March 3, as reported by SOAWatch:
At approximately midnight last night, the General Coordinator of COPINH, Berta Caceres was assassinated in her hometown of La Esperanza, Intibuca.
At least two individuals broke down the door of the house where Berta was staying for the evening in the Residencial La Líbano, shot and killed her.
World-renowned for her activism, Caceres won the the Goldman Environmental Prize last year for successfully stopping the construction of a major river dam.
With the honor came a stream of death threats, as noted by the press release that accompanied her award:
What stopped are death threats to Cáceres.
Her murder would not surprise her colleagues, who keep a eulogy—but hope to never have to use it.
Despite these risks, she maintains a public presence in order to continue her work.
In a country with some of the highest murder rates in the world, Cáceres hopes the victory in Agua Zarca will bring hope to activists fighting irresponsible development in Honduras and throughout Latin America.
The organization “Witness for Peace” summarized what forces Caceres went up against, when she opposed the dam:
Following the US-backed coup in Honduras in 2009, the floodgates for selling off Honduran land and natural resources to transnational and national corporations blew open.
For example, the coup government granted 47 hydroelectric dam concessions with a single law, without consulting the communities that would be directly impacted and thereby violated international conventions including the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) convention 169 that requires the Honduran state to defend indigenous land and natural resources and prevent their forced displacement.
In just the past few days, Caceres' organization, COPINHHONDURAS, spoke out against repression aim at indigenous communities, sharing evidence of the dispossession of the Lenca community:
A chronology of dispossession: lands are being grabbed from more Honduran Lenca communities
The UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Rights has also highlighted the abuses against the Lenca community and its struggle for a better environment.
During her recent visit to Honduras, she stated:
In the course of the visit and my examination of the situation of indigenous peoples, I observed the critical situation faced by them regarding their rights on their lands and natural resources, violence, impunity and corruption, access to justice and lack of adequate social services including in education and health.
Honduras, which is plagued with endemic corruption, has a horrendous record when it comes to the murder of environmental activists and women.
Organizations from all over the world are urging the Honduran government to take immediate steps to address the issues to which Caceres devoted her life.
Activists are also appealing to other countries to put pressure on Honduran officials, who just launched the Honduran Commission Against Impunity.
There are hopes that the commission could be an opportunity for the government to prove its political will.
For now, all that's clear in the aftermath of Caceres' murder is the nation's desperate need for some mechanism to help stem the tide of violence, corruption, and impunity.
Image from the Social Media Index Report showing top six radio stations on Twitter.
The emergence of social media has revolutionised the way media transmits information to its audience in Africa, especially Ghana.
Media houses now count social media platforms as important channels for distributing news.
In assessing the real usage of social media by news outlets in Ghana, Penplusbytes, a non-profit organisation promoting effective governance using technology in Africa, has released its first Social Media Index (SMI) report on Ghana’s print, radio and television media houses.
According to a press release issued by Penplusbytes, the index examined the media houses’ activity on social media up until February 8, 2016, and how effectively they use social media platforms, especially Twitter and Facebook, to interact with their target audience.The report looked at 37 newspapers found to be in active operation and/or most visible in newsstands.
It also looked at 16 out of the 22 TV stations and 309 out of the 390 radio stations currently operating on air.
The report shows low usage of social media by print media.
Many of the newspapers in Ghana do not have a strong social media presence as compared to radio and TV stations.
According to the report, 20 out of 37 newspaper have active Facebook pages, and only 6 have active Twitter handles.
Radio
The radio stations in Ghana, according to the report, use social media more actively to engage their audience than newspapers.
Citi FM, one of Ghana's most influential media houses, was identified as the leader in social media presence in Ghana.
Citi FM has over 600,000 likes on Facebook and a verified Twitter account (the first media house in Ghana that got a verified account by Twitter) with over 265,000 followers.
Joy FM, another influential outlet, leads on Twitter with over 330,000 followers.

Newspaper
According to the report, Daily Graphic, the most read newspaper in Ghana, had the highest number of likes on Facebook with over 621,000 likes.
Daily Guide, a privately owned newspaper, took the lead with respect to number of Twitter followers - over 12,000.
After Penplusbytes promoted their report on Facebook, Fundraising Africa, an online fundraising website, commented that:
More and more Ghanaians are looking to social media for up to the minute news, so it's important for the local media houses to satisfy this need or else Ghanaians may end up favouring foreign media houses' social media accounts.

A farmer showing a drought affected field in Lesotho.
Photo used with permission from Send a Cow.
Send a Cow, a UK-based international development charity, organized a live Twitter chat, #askLesotho, on February 24, 2016, to discuss Lesotho's worst drought in recent history and the relative lack of media attention.
Lesotho, a landlocked kingdom completely surrounded by South Africa, declared a state of emergency last month.
According local UN officials, as many as one in three Basotho may require food aid until next year.
World Food Programme's country director Mary Njoroge says the drought has forced people to adopt negative coping mechanisms, which include selling assets and even theft.
The country experienced a downpour recently, leading to what experts call 'green drought'.
The rain deceptively greened Lesotho's valley where fields have no crops or vegetables.
The drought is caused by the El Niño weather pattern, which has left more than 100 million people in southern Africa, Asia and Latin America without food.
Over the hour-long Twitter chat, Send a Cow Lesotho’s country director Manthethe Monethi answered questions from various individuals and organisations.
There were some challenges as Manthethe experienced an electricity shortage and was forced to change location shortly before the chat took place and a slow Internet connection in Lesotho meant responses were delayed.
The importance of vegetable growth was a key issue in the conversation.
Unlike maize, which usually takes five months from planting to harvest, vegetables grow very quickly.
Lumela 'M'e Manthethe!
If we help you to provide vegetable seeds for families now, when will they be ready to eat? #asklesotho — Dolen Cymru (@DolenCymru) February 24, 2016

@jamnam1982 #askLesotho Livestock production is equally affected because it depends on rangelands and water — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016
Joey Brownbill wanted to know if Send a Cow operates like the World Food Programme:
Are you providing food aid like @WFP? #asklesotho — Joey Brownbill (@joeybrownbill) February 24, 2016
@joeybrownbill @WFP #askLesotho We do not provide food aid, we provide training and agricultural inputs — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016
He then wanted to know if that solution is practical:
@SendaCowLesotho @WFP but how will that help people now? #askLesotho — Joey Brownbill (@joeybrownbill) February 24, 2016
@joeybrownbill @WFP #askLesotho Vegetable production cycle is short- 5 weeks, and availability is sustained through preservation techniques — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016

#askLesotho Q from HelpAge SA: Is the current humanitarian response age and gender inclusive? — Send a Cow (@SendaCow) February 24, 2016
@SendaCow #askLesotho The response is age and gender inclusive, targeting the most vulnerable, ie,elderly,OVCs,people with disabilities, etc — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016
Another user questioned the severity of the crisis, asking whether it was a ‘‘once-in-a-lifetime’’ or ‘‘once in a few years’’ crisis:
@MrsMoulogo @SendaCow #askLesotho I'd be interested to know how bad is the emergency in context-once in a lifetime, or once every few years? — Waterloo Foundation (@Waterloo_TWF) February 24, 2016

@Waterloo_TWF @SendaCowLesotho 1) The problem is getting worse, so we must tackle it with long-term solution, not just food aid.
Families — Send a Cow (@SendaCow) February 24, 2016 A Twitter user based in Wales, Cathy Moulogo, wanted to know the benefits of recent downpour:
Hi @SendaCow are the current rains making any improvement to the drought situation? #asklesotho — Cathy Moulogo (@MrsMoulogo) February 24, 2016
@MrsMoulogo @SendaCow #askLesotho The current rains are going to make some improvement, esp on vegetable production & livestock — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016
She then wanted to know what can be done to alleviate hunger:
@SendaCowLesotho @SendaCow that's great news!
Will there still be widespread hunger?
What can we do about it? #asklesotho — Cathy Moulogo (@MrsMoulogo) February 24, 2016
@MrsMoulogo @SendaCow #askLesotho We need to intensify vegetable production for consumption and income,and fodder production for livestock — Manthethe Monethi (@SendaCowLesotho) February 24, 2016

"Cuba and Obama reestablish relations."
Cartoon via Linhas Livres.
“Cuba’s future will be decided by Cubans.”
Speaking in Havana on March 21, 2016, Obama vowed that the US trade embargo on Cuba “will end” and signaled his intention to respect the decisions of Cubans about their country's future.
While Obama’s tone marked a clear departure from the rhetoric of past US presidents, his choice of words left plenty of netizens wondering who Obama really means when he says “Cubans”.
Pro-government blogger Iroel Sanchez responded, asking:
Obama says that the future of Cuba is a matter for Cubans to decide.
Or all Cubans?
Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits are watching intently this week as President Barack Obama becomes the first sitting US president to visit the country since 1928.
Hundreds of US journalists reporting on the visit appear almost giddy as they tweet and report on everything from trade to AirBnB accommodations to the upcoming Industriales - Tampa Rays baseball game.
Meanwhile, Cubans on the island (at least those with Internet access) and off are voicing firm critiques of both leaders.
Writing for La Joven Cuba, a collective blog of university students who tend to express support for the Castro government, Jesús López Martínez suggested that rather than allowing Obama to “bring a vision of progress” to Cuba, Cuban leaders should teach Obama the benefits of their system:
We can offer our insight on public health, something he can take back to his country, where millions of people have no healthcare.
If he wants to talk about human rights, we can teach him how our police behave, so that he can avoid the manslaughter of black people by their own police forces.
While numerous Twitter users echoed Martínez' sentiment regarding public health, heavy policing of public areas and a surge in detentions of anti-government activists before and during the visit undercut his second argument.
Indeed, the visit has been marred by arrests and detentions of some of the Castro government’s most vociferous local critics.
High-profile human rights advocate Elizardo Sánchez was also detained while en route to Havana on Saturday, where he intends to meet with Obama.
Sánchez estimates that 180 Cubans have been arrested before and during the visit thus far.
How many countries comply with all human rights?
None.'
Prominent US television journalist Andrea Mitchell asked both leaders how the two countries would work together given their disagreements on the issue.
Following Obama's response, Castro said:
What country complies with ?
Do you know how many?
I do.
None.
None whatsoever. Some countries comply some rights, other comply others.
And we are among these countries.
Out of these 61 instruments, Cuba has complied with 47 of these human rights instruments.
There are countries that may comply with more, those that comply with less.
I think human rights issues should not be politicized.
Castro then continued, touting Cuba's healthcare and education systems and guarantees of equal pay for all genders.
Shortly thereafter, a reporter asked if the Cuban government would consider releasing political prisoners.
Raúl Castro first expressed doubt as to the existence of political prisoners in Cuba, then responded: “Give me a list of political prisoners and I will release them,” and then refused to speak further on the matter.
Shortly thereafter, Cubans and Cuban-Americans on Facebook and Twitter began sharing multiple versions of such a list.
Technologist and blogger Eliécer Avila pointed out that Raúl’s response showed a total lack of due process in Cuba:
...It demonstrates that here there is no law or judicial system beyond will, this is why he confidently promises that if he’s given a list of political prisoners, “they’ll be on the street by tonight.”
Multiple reports have surfaced indicating that Cuban state police exerted increased control on the public and on vocal critics of the regime in particular.
Democracy advocate and council member of the Christian Liberation Movement Rosa María Rodriguez described state precautions around the visit as “millimetric.”
“Nothing moves without them knowing about it,” she said.
Rodriguez’ organization, which is based in Cuba, was founded by Oswaldo Payá, a democracy advocate best known for pushing for democratic change within the bounds of Cuba’s constitution until he died in a car crash under mysterious circumstances in 2012.
Multiple critics, most of whom are writing from outside Cuba, commented on the meaning of Obama's political identity and image within the Cuban context.
What does it mean, they asked, for Cubans to see a relatively young, black president elected for two terms in the US, while Cuba's top-level leadership is still dominated by white men in their 70s and 80s?
Recent census numbers indicate that 14% of the US population identifies as black or mixed-race, while an estimated 36% of the Cuban population identifies as black or "mestizo" (mixed race).
Writing for Huffington Post, US sociologist and Cuba expert Ted Henken reflected on racial discrimination in both the US and Cuba, describing Obama as “a powerful symbol" of US achievement in "racial justice and equality," while acknowledging that the US still has a "long way to go."
Obama embodies many things that young Cubans on the island value after 56 years of communism: the social and political rise of African-Americans in the United States, a push for public policies that benefit a majority of citizens….a democrat of the 21st century who speaks the language of democracy of the 21st century.
But Obama is also living proof of something that young Cubans must view with a mix of longing and fascination: a politician who will be stepping down from power at 55 years old, the age of the youngest people among the governing octogenarians on the island…
Marxists decry state control of public discourse
Observatorio Crítico, a communist intellectual blogging collective put forth a more nuanced critique of the way Cuban authorities handled the visit, drawing from a Marxist perspective:
In situations like Obama’s visit, our country is supposed to avoid showing conflict or confrontation, but we reserve the need to distinguish between government protocols and public expression.
… Public organizations and other avenues for civil society expression are indispensable in process of achieving political agitation in the face of official visits by leaders such as Obama and François Hollande, or in the context of arbitrary moves made by these governments towards entities with whom they want to improve economic relations.
Observatorio Critico makes a keen observation here: Despite their disagreements on human rights and social policy, at the end of the day, the rekindling of diplomatic ties between Cuba and the US may stem chiefly from a shared belief that the shift will better serve the economic interests of both parties.

Grafik Rebel Untuk Protes & Aktivisme (Grupa) said the campaign aims to inspire the public to support the work of independent journalists:
We feel that the time has come for Malaysians to demand for media and internet freedom in light of the latest assault on freedom of speech in Malaysia.
It is thanks to such tactics many journalists from independent portals face a tough time when covering ruling party lawmakers and the reporters from the mainstream media are often dubbed government lapdogs.
Since January, the Malaysian government has blocked three news websites and three socio-political blogs.
It blocked the Medium and Asia Sentinel news websites for carrying a report originally published by Sarawak Report about the corruption scandal involving Prime Minister Najib Razak.
The Sarawak Report was banned in Malaysia in 2015.
Two weeks ago, The Malaysia Insider was blocked for allegedly posting an ‘unverified’ information regarding the corruption case of Najib.
Najib is accused of receiving more than 600 million US dollars from a state-run investment firm.
Najib denies this and claims that the money in his banks was a political donation from a royal family in the Middle East.
The issue sparked massive protests in Malaysia and some of Najib’s allies even called for his resignation.
Activists and opposition leaders believe the suspension of some newspapers and the blocking of websites are part of the government’s attempt to hide information about the corruption case.
Even social media users are targeted by authorities.
The blogs OutSyed The Box, Din Turtle and Minaq Jingo Fotopages were blocked for being critical of the government.
The Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC) threatened Internet users who are sharing satirical clown memes of Najib.
Interestingly, it was also Grupa which popularized the clown memes after police warned an activist artist that the latter is being monitored for tweeting a clown image of Najib.
Grupa’s campaign against censorship promotes the hashtags‪ #‎freethemedia and‬ ‪#‎bebasmedia (free the media)‬.
Below are some of the posters uploaded on Grupa’s Facebook and Twitter pages:
Grupa asserts that the media should not simply broadcast government propaganda, especially those coming from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).

In late February 2016, Japan's census bureau announced that the country's population has experienced a net decline, with more people dying than being born, for the first time since the state started keeping these records in 1920.
The news of comes amidst regular news reports in Western media that Japanese people are having less sex than ever before.
Some Western writers are even asking why young people in Japan stopped having sex.
How much sex are Japanese people having, anyway, and could having more sex help Japan improve its declining birth rate?
Japan's Population Is Officially in Decline
First, let's consider Japan's population decline.
Over the past five years (Japan conducts full census surveys once a decade, with a partial count after five years), Japan's population shrank by nearly 950,000 people (by 0.7 percent) to 127.1 million people.
Nearly a third of all Japanese were over 65 years old in 2015.
By 2050, almost 40 percent will be older than 65.
To make matters worse for the future of Japan's population, the country's fertility rate has been about 1.41 births per woman, putting it well below the "population replacement rate" of about 2.1 (the average number of children born per woman to replace the population for nearly forty years since the 1970s).
The census bureau's announcement this month of a net decline in Japan's population, then, has been foreseen for quite a while.
Japan is not the only country in the world experiencing this phenomenon.
In Germany, fertility has remained below 1.5 children per woman since 1975, while the World Bank notes that the East Asia and Pacific region is aging faster than any other region.
In other words, the nation's “graying” is a global challenge that's not unique to Japan.
The Abe government aims to "stabilize" Japan's population at 100 million by encouraging women (somehow) to have more children and improve Japan's population rate.
The main problem (says conventional wisdom, at any rate) is that Japanese people are no longer interested in having sex.
Japan's "Celibacy Syndrome": Real or Imagined by the Foreign Media?
Rather than comparing it with its peers like Germany, Japan's population is often connected to the perception that Japanese people just aren't having sex.
There apparently seems to be a name for this phenomenon in Japan: the "celibacy syndrome" (セックスしない症候群).
Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry for this phrase quotes a 2013 Guardian article as the primary source for the term.
A Japanese-language article about "celibacy syndrome" begins by referencing a 2013 BBC documentary called "No Sex, Please, We're Japanese."
Most of the search results for “セックスしない症候群” seem to have appeared around 2013, and articles by foreign-owned media properties such as Huffington Post and China's People's Daily Online are at the top of the Japanese-language results.
2006/07 Durex Survey Still Influential
The idea may have originated with the gold-standard for sex research, the Sexual Wellbeing Global Survey.
Conducted by condom-maker Durex in 2006 and 2007, this poll from nearly a decade ago interviewed 26,000 people, aged 16 and older, across 26 countries about their sexual habits.
Despite being almost 10 years old, the results of the Durex survey continue to be recycled year after year by both Western and Japanese media.
For example, in a 2014 article in the online edition of magazine Toyo Kezai, Sechiyama Kaku, a professor at University of Tokyo, cites the 2006/07 Durex study to argue that "Japan has the lowest sexual frequency in the world."
(In the Durex study, Japanese respondents reported having sexual intercourse 45 times a year, the lowest number among all the 41 countries surveyed.)
That said, a little-known, more recent Japanese report seems to confirm Durex's conclusions about Japan's national libido.
As a matter of fact, Sagami, a leading condom company in Japan, conducted its own survey on sex in Japan in 2013.
Blogger Yuta Aoki summarized the results of the Sagami survey here in English.
Aoki notes that the more recent Sagami survey seems to confirm Durex's conclusion: Japanese people report not having a lot of sex.
Japan's "Sexless Marriages"
Aoki notes that Sagami's survey indicates that people in relationships in Japan (Durex surveyed anyone sexually active) may be having sex far less than 45 times per year.
A 2006 survey by Bayer found that Japanese married couples had sex just 17 a year, on average.
On top of that, the Sagami study found that 55.2 percent of married couples consider themselves to be sexless.
"Sexless marriage" has become a hot topic in Japan in recent years.
In a survey of its own, the Japan Family Planning Association found that most married men were too busy or tired from work to have sex.
Japanese women reported that sex was "too bothersome."
However, the interesting thing about Sagami's study, Aoki reports, is that, generally speaking, people in Japan have no aversion to sex: 83 percent of single men and 58 percent of single women in their 20s and 30s say they want to have sex.
While there may be a variety of reasons why some people in Japan are going without sex, an aversion to intercourse doesn't appear to be one of them.
Japanese Men May Be Having Sex, Just Not Always With Their Partners
It's important to note that, in the context of the Sagami survey, people in couples who reported being part of a "sexless marriage" were simply reporting on whether or not they were having sex with their partners.
What goes almost universally unreported is extramarital sex, and sex for money.
According to various surveys, between 10 and 20 percent of Japanese men admit to extramarital sex (不倫, furin) with women at about half that number.
So, even if many Japanese people are in sexless marriages, it's not always accurate to say they're having no sex.
On top of that, many married men in Japan also avail themselves of the country's US$5 billion (5兆6,884億 円) sex trade.
Indeed, a significant minority of married heterosexual men in Japan are choosing to pay for sex.
A Significant Minority of Japanese Men May Be Paying for Sex
According to Japan's National Police Agency (NPA), as of 2011 there were more than 29,000 businesses connected to the sex industry (性風俗関連特殊営業, seifuzokukanrentokushueigyo)—10,000 more businesses than four years earlier in 2007.
Japan's sex trade consists of a variety of establishments and enterprises, including brothels ("soaplands"), massage parlors, escort agencies, and “paid” dating services.
In one poll conducted by MiW (a community devoted to providing support and advice to those whose spouses had engaged in extramarital sex), 23 percent of married men surveyed in Tokyo said they had paid for sex.
Another survey by the National Women's Education Center of Japan found that 40 percent of Japanese men pay for sex.
So, while Japan's "celibacy syndrome" may exist, it may only be between heterosexual couples in long-term relationships.
Where Does This Leave Japan's Declining Birth Rate?
Thanks to a new policy by the Abe government, women in Japan are being put in a double—or even triple—bind: Japanese women are being encouraged to have more children in order to increase the country's fertility rate and slow population decline.
At the same time, Japanese women are being encouraged to "lean in" and participate more in the workforce.
However, women will still be expected to be responsible for childcare, while looking after ageing relatives.
So, even if more sex means a higher birth rate, for Japanese women it could mean just more work, and even less free time than they have now.

Liberia is poised to set another first for Africa.
The country was the first in Africa to have a female president when Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf was elected in 2006.
Now, the country is embarking on what some are calling another first in Africa: outsourcing its entire pre-primary and primary education system to a private American company.
Education in Liberia was severely affected by the First Liberian Civil War and Second Liberian Civil War between 1989 and 2003.
It is estimated that 50% of young women and 68% of young men have completed primary school or, if not, are able to read a whole sentence.
The situation was exacerbated during the recent Ebola crisis.
Liberian Education Minister George Werner announced in January 2016 that pre-primary and primary public education would be outsourced to Bridge International Academies, a private US-based company, for a five-year period.
The government of Liberia will pay over $65 million.
Bridge International Academies describes itself as the world’s largest education innovation company, currently operational in Kenya and Uganda.
Class sizes can be as large as 60 students.
Unlike the company's schools in Kenya and Uganda, where families pay tuition of about $6 per term, parents in Libera would not pay for the schools out of pocket.
The move has drawn international and local criticism.
Education experts plan to exert pressure on the Liberia government not to go ahead with the plan.
Opposing the plan, Kishore Sing, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the right to education, said in press release in March:
It is ironic that Liberia does not have resources to meet its core obligations to provide a free primary education to every child, but it can find huge sums of money to subcontract a private company to do so on its behalf.
She also took issue with the company’s claim that its students do better than their comparable peers at government schools, pointing out the data comes from a study commissioned by the company itself.
However, privatised public education might be a good bet for Liberia, whose system is currently "in shambles," she concedes:
In that case, an education system, which is modelled on accountability, standardisation, analytical rigour, and policy changes that can be backed with rich data sets – albeit private – is far better than what Liberia has at the moment.
Reacting to the news, Jan Resseger, an American public education expert and blogger, questioned the motives of the company's investors, which include the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank Group:
One must also examine the motivation of some of the so-called investors described as backing the work of Bridge International Academies, for example Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.
Are these tech-philanthropists supporting such an international education venture as part of their philanthropic aid work or is the purpose to expand the worldwide market for the kind of education technology that has created their personal fortunes?
Global Education Monitoring Report, which is published by UNESCO, expressed concern over the issue:
Thinking of schools only as places to learn how to read may appear a reasonable idea in a country where most children cannot achieve even that.
However, it risks reducing appreciably the purpose of education.
Policy-makers need to be aware that good teaching cannot be delivered by just anybody out of a script.
The National Teachers' Association of Liberia, among other civil society organizations, have sent a letter to Liberian Education Minister George K. Werner explaining their concerns that the privatisation plan poses a "serious threat" and represents the "commercialisation of education services in Liberia."
Others, meanwhile, have expressed their opinion on social media:
Mind-blowing.
Might be last post but I'm determined to gain my freedom bec I'm innocent.
Jailed anti-censorship activist and blogger Hossein Ronaghi Maleki is struggling for his health and freedom.
He began a hunger strike March 26, to protest prison authorities' refusal to give him proper medical care and demand his release.
His health now is deteriorating rapidly.
According to a correspondence between Maleki's father and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (ICHRI), authorities “have threatened him that if his family makes noise about his case he will be transferred to Rajaee Shahr Prison,” located in the northern city of Karaj.
Rajaee Shahr is known for its poor conditions, particularly for political prisoners.
Previous reports suggest that in-person visits would be limited there, if not impossible.
This Thursday, April 14 will mark Maleki's 20th day on a hunger strike.
Supporters are calling on the global community of activists and technologists who stand up for freedom of expression and access to information to raise their voices on Maleki's behalf using the hashtag #NoJail4Hossein.
Maleki blogged under the nickname Babak Khorramdin, the name of an ancient Persian freedom fighter from Azerbaijan (Maleki is an ethnic Iranian Azeri).
He is also a computer programmer who worked actively in setting up websites aimed at circumventing online censorship.
The networks of international actors working on Internet freedom and building innovative ways for Iranians to access the Internet is vast.
Maleki is very much a part of this community, but unlike many of his fellow activists, his work landed him directly in the line of fire.
Maleki was arrested in December 2009, six months after Iran's disputed presidential elections.
He was immediately incarcerated at the notorious Evin prison, serving 376 days in solitary confinement before seeing trial in 2010.
This led to a 15-year sentence on charges of “spreading propaganda against the regime”, “membership of the Internet group Iran Proxy” and “insulting the Iranian supreme leader and the president.”
Maleki was released in 2015 on a temporary six-month furlough to receive medical treatment for kidney failure, but returned to prison on January 19, 2016.
His return to prison came despite recommendations by the Medical Examiner that his health is unfit for the Iranian prison system.
The denial of medical care is a routine practice for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.
Global Voices' Advox and Iran teams are encouraging supporters to give as much exposure as possible to Maleki by sharing his case on social media, and using the hashtags #NoJail4Hossein.
Appeals can also be sent tagging the President Hassan Rouhani or the Supreme Leader.
Tweets in English should be sent to @HassanRouhani and @Khamenei_ir.
Tweets in Persian should be sent to @Rouhani_ir and @Khamenei_fa.

As a teenager, he worked as a translator with the US military in Iraq.

This article by Jacob Resneck originally appeared on PRI.org on March 24, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Ibrahim Esmael Ibrahim is a 26-year-old nattily dressed guy from Baghdad.
When I met him, he was standing on the platform at the train station in Idomeni, Greece — though there are no trains running now.
Ibrahim speaks good English; as a teenager he landed a job with GLS (Global Linguist Solutions), a Virginia-based contractor that provided interpreters to the US military during the Iraq war.
He says the pay was good — $1,500 a month plus bonuses.
The soldiers liked him and nicknamed him AP.
But after six months on the job, Ibrahim says his life was threatened by insurgents.
"They told me I will cut your head from your body if I see you again here," he recalls.
Ibrahim’s family urged him to leave the country.
But before he got out, he emailed his favorite American sergeants to tell them what was going on.
"I told them what happened with me and they told me to give my badge number to GLS in the Green Zone in Baghdad," he says, recalling the incident 10 years later.
"So I went there and gave to them and the next day I took a bus to Syria."
In Damascus, he found a white-collar job at a telecom company.
But he dreamed of some day going to the US where his sister lives.
His brother-in-law pointed out that because of his service to the US military in Iraq, he could apply for a US Special Immigrant Visa.
But for that, he’d need proof of his employment.
So he wrote to GLS, the company with the big Pentagon contract.
"They don’t answer, they don’t answer me," he tells me.
"They say the contract is closed with the US Army and you can’t get your documents.
It’s very difficult."
PRI's The World contacted GLS in Virginia last week and left several messages, but we've yet to get a response.
Ibrahim say he stayed in Syria for a few years, then moved to the Kurdish region of northern Iraq where he worked odd jobs under the table.
But he says being an ethnic Arab there was a problem; Kurdish authorities told him to go back to Baghdad, but he was too afraid to go.
Instead, he crossed the border into Turkey, where he met an Afghan woman in 2014.
They got married in a religious service.
Ibrahim says she was able to get to Canada, but she can’t bring him over because they don’t have a legal marriage license.
"I’m alone.
My wife is in Canada and my sister is in America," Ibrahim says.
His parents are in Turkey and he says his sister is able to bring them to the United States in a few months, but it might take years for him to get permission.
So Europe is his preferred destination for now.
But under the European Union’s new deal with Turkey, it’s unlikely he’ll be allowed to stay.
The EU plans to send back asylum seekers like Ibrahim who make the crossing from Turkey to Greece.
Turkey has agreed to take them back in exchange for about $6 billion in aid and other incentives.
The EU says the arrangement would discourage people from paying smuggler’s fees and risking their lives to make the perilous Aegean crossing from Turkey to Greece.
But critics say when one route closes, another just opens up.
Most of the asylum seekers who have gotten stopped in Greece are Syrians escaping the war at home.

And human rights officials say the prospect of mass deportation is inhumane and potentially, a violation of international law.
"Every person seeking protection has the right to have his case examined on a case-by-case basis on the individual merits," Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner Nils Muiznieks told The World.
He says the EU’s agreement with Turkey threatens to throw that principle out the window.
Tanzanian netizen Isaac Habakuk Emily, who hails from the Arusha region in the north of the African nation, appeared in court on April 15, 2016 on charges of "insulting" the country's president, John Magufuli.
Emily's statements are allegedly contrary to Section 16 of Tanzania's Cybercrime Act No. 14 of 2015, which says:
Any person who publishes information, data or facts presented in a picture, text, symbol or any other form in a computer system where such information, data or fact is false, desceptive, misleading or inaccurate commits an offence, and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not less than three million shillings or to imprisonment for a term not less than six months or to both.
Emily is accused of posting a controversial Facebook message (in Swahili) on March 17, 2015, even while knowing that counterfactual criticism of the country's president is against the law.
His comment was in reference to President Magufuli's surprise live call to Clouds TV's current affairs program, 360, during which the president thanked the presenters and expressed his admiration for the show.
Theatrics in politics , how come you compare this imbecile to Nyerere ?
His offence has taken place against the backdrop of Tanzania's parliament passing a cybercrime bill on April 1, 2015, to address cybercrime issues such as child pornography, cyberbullying, online impersonation, electronic production of racist and xenophobic content, spam, illegal interception of communications, and the publication of false information.
Despite widespread opposition from politicians, social media practitioners, donors and human rights activists, the bill was pushed through parliament with relatively little discussion or debate.
They have also cautioned that police or the state could use their power to harass online activists or social media users.
That same month, another netizen, Sospiter Jonas, was arraigned in a primary court in Dodoma Region and charged with “misuse of the Internet” after he posted a message on Facebook saying that Tanzanian Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda “will only become a gospel preacher.”
The four appeared before a Magistrate's court in Dar Es Salaam on November 6, 2015.
Public prosecutors alleged that the accused published audio information on a WhatsApp group called the "Soka Group", that was intended to mislead the public during the October 2015 Tanzanian general elections, which were plagued by accusations of vote-rigging.
As far as this latest incident goes, Emily is scheduled to appear in court again on April 18, 2016 for judgement on his bail application.

By Jemila Abdulai.
A version of this article was originally published on Circumspecte.com.
Let's talk for a second about the March 13 terrorist attack in Côte d'Ivoire.
Specifically, about what Ghana and other African countries should learn or do.
For those who don't know, an estimated 16 people died on March 13 in Grand-Bassam, Côte d'Ivoire.
The former Ivorian capital and a UNESCO World Heritage site, Grand-Bassam is a popular resort and beach town a few hours from Abidjan, the country's capital city. I visited it numerous times when I lived in Côte d'Ivoire.
From a Ghanaian perspective, Grand Bassam could easily be Ada Foah or Labadi Beach.
In Senegal, it could be Gorée Island or any of Dakar’s many popular beaches.
But none of this is new.
Same script, different cast.
In terms of strategy, the attackers (Al-Qaeda, in this case) have remained consistent.
"From a Ghanaian perspective, Grand Bassam could easily be Ada Foah or Labadi Beach.
In Senegal, it could be Gorée Island or any of Dakar’s many popular beaches."
What exactly is this strategy?
To attack sites frequented by expatriates and tourists—hotels, resorts, shopping malls, places of entertainment.
They've done so in Burkina Faso and Mali, in Tunisia and Kenya, and now Côte d'Ivoire.
The strategy might be slightly different in each country (location, for instance), but the motive is largely the same: to draw attention and press coverage to their perceived political grievances.
Why expat or tourist sites?
They want international—not local—press coverage.
Hitting such sites means more countries are involved.
For example, among the Côte d'Ivoire attack victims were nationals of Germany, France, Cameroon, Mali, and Burkina Faso.
One attack, six countries affected (not counting the injured).
The January 2016 attack in Burkina Faso resulted in the deaths of people of 18 different nationalities.
And this is not counting the numerous local citizens who are also affected.
Another factor is that these groups appear to ride off existing press coverage.
Burkina Faso had a civilian uprising prior to the attack there.
Mali has been in the news since Gaddafi demise, with a lot of coverage about its United Nations heritage sites.
And Côte d'Ivoire has been getting lots of positive press lately, especially since the October 2015 presidential election.
The country recently overtook Nigeria as the preferred investment destination in the sub-region.
So, if the trends are clear and the motives generally consistent, the next question is what are African governments doing to prevent, combat or prepare for attacks?
The attackers are being strategic—and to a degree coordinated—how are we doing the same?
When the November 2015 Paris attacks took place, the whole of Europe—and the US—went on high alert and ramped up security, as they've certainly had to do once again after this week's attacks in Brussels.
After the Paris attacks, the United Kingdom police also disseminated a video and information, targeted at civilians, on what to do during a terror attack.
West Africa has experienced three terrorist attacks in recent times (not counting Nigeria).
In Ghana, at least, beyond news headlines and short-lived discussions about security, I've seen no concrete follow-up information on the attacks, much more about what to do in the event of one.
"West Africa has experienced three terrorist attacks in recent times (not counting Nigeria).
In Ghana, at least, beyond news headlines and short-lived discussions about security, I've seen no concrete follow-up information on the attacks, much more about what to do in the event of one."
How, for instance, do we evacuate buildings—hotels or places of work—in the event of an attack?
Have we mapped exit routes out of the capitals and other major cities?
Is there a national or regional early warning system or strategy for attack-prone sites like hotels and resorts?
Have we undertaken training for first responders like police and ambulances?
Really, where and what is our plan?
I've been asking these questions since the 2013 Al-Shabab attack on Kenya’s Westgate Mall in Nairobi.
Where is Africa's regional strategy on security and terrorism?
If it exists, how are regional bodies like the ECOWAS and the African Union making sure citizens in their member countries are aware of measures being taken?
Where is our equivalent of the cross-border coordination that has taken place after the European attacks?
The United States probably has the most comprehensive security intelligence in West Africa—are there any intelligence-sharing deals with African governments?
At the end of the day, information, vigilance and preparedness are what will save lives.
Ghana shares borders with Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire, in case you hadn't noticed—too close for comfort.
Senegal is another country which should be on high alert.
Ghana has many sites that are frequented by expats and tourists, and a diverse international community.
It also has marginalized communities ripe for exploitation by terrorist seeking to recruit members.
Regardless of our much heralded "peace", these are the facts.
Life in Ghana not rosy for everyone.
We are as vulnerable as any of the countries that has already experienced attacks.
What can be done?
I don't even need to dig deep: What is the word for "terrorist" in local Ghanian languages such as Twi? Ewe?
Ga? Does the average Ghanaian know that "Al-Kayida", is not just a popular Ashanti dance, but also evokes and represents something terrifying and dangerous?
If someone were to shout "Al-Qaeda", would some people break out their best dance moves, or would they make a break for it and run?
Have Ghanaians followed the other attacks in the region closely?
Have we been informed or educated enough to understand key elements like the fact that shouting or praying "in Jesus' name" might not be the best bet when confronted, as the terrorists have often targeted Christians?
Will people, children especially, know to run away from the sound of gunfire, or will they think it's the sound of leftover firecrackers from Christmas?
The danger is not as far away as we may think.
We are nowhere as prepared as we should be.
And, as a 2012 Ghanaian presidential candidate once pointed out, attacks have little to do with internal peace or relations between religious groups.
There are things we can begin doing right away.
Like sensitizing people, coming up with ways to describe terror events in local languages, warn people, and so on.
We can also take regional incidents like those in Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Burkina Faso seriously, instead of simply launching "pray for X country" campaigns.
We also need to separate protocol from convenience.
Why are there so many motorcades, both civilian and military, in Accra these days?
When a real emergency happens, how will we know the difference?
Terror spreads quickly when there is lack of information and order.
Attacks that happen elsewhere shouldn't just be an occasion to "thank God it's not us".
Rather, they should also be an incitement to think of "what we would do, if...".

It's also an appeal for Africa to come together as one and combat terrorism:

Yangon residents have to adjust to the increased temperatures and water shortages brought by the El Niño weather pattern.
Photo and caption by Hein Htet / The Irrawaddy
This is an article from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.
The effects of the weather phenomenon El Niño are already being felt in several countries in the Asia-Pacific.
As El Niño hits the most extreme of its 12- to 18-month cycle, large swaths of Myanmar have been beleaguered by high temperatures and water shortages.
Summer typically does not begin until March, but temperatures are already relatively intense.
Meteorologists have predicted that water shortages in many parts of Myanmar could be ratcheted up by as much as three-fold in the coming months.
In Yangon, the country’s main urban hub, temperatures have already soared to 35 degrees Celsius in recent days, forcing people to take shelter under any shade they can find.
In Dala, a town across the river from Yangon, water scarcity is more palpable.
Irrawaddy photographers Hein Htet and Pyay Kyaw recently documented how the residents of Rangoon and Dala have been coping with the country’s intense weather conditions.

Former South Africa's president Thabo Mbeki says a virus cannot cause a syndrome.
Image released under Creative Commons by Antônio Milena/ABr.
Former South African president Thabo Mbeki has reignited AIDS denialism controversy after writing an article titled "A Brief Commentary on The Question of HIV and AIDS."
While in office, Mbeki and his former Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, nicknamed "Dr. Beetroot," were accused of denying that the HIV virus causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), despite conclusive scientific evidence on the matter.
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang promoted the use of lemon, beetroot, garlic and olive oil to treat AIDS.
During his presidency from 1999 to 2008, Mbeki accused scientists who linked HIV to AIDS of racism.
He argued that accepting Western conventional wisdom on AIDS would be absurd and illogical.
He opposed the use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), saying that they were "poisons" and products of greed by Western pharmaceutical companies.
He organized a Presidential Advisory Panel regarding HIV/AIDS in 2000, which attracted scientists such as Peter Duesberg and Harvey Bialy, who deny that HIV causes AIDS.
In his March 7, 2016 article, Mbeli refutes claims that he ever said that HIV does not cause AIDS.
What he believes, he says, is that a virus cannot cause a syndrome:
I must also mention that I never said “HIV does not cause AIDS”.
This false accusation was made by people who benefitted from trumpeting the slogan “HIV causes AIDS” as though this was a religious edict.
What I said is that “a virus cannot cause a syndrome”.
As you know, AIDS is an acronym for “Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome” – therefore AIDS is a syndrome, i.e. a collection of well-known diseases, with well-known causes.
They are not, together, caused and cannot be caused by one virus!
I said that HIV might be a contributory cause of immune deficiency – the ID in AIDS!

It is estimated that Mbeki's views and his opposition to the use of ARVs during his presidency lead to up to 365,000 deaths from AIDS.
Responding to criticisms that his denial contributed to the number of deaths in his country, he shared data from Statistics South Africa (Statssa) showing ten leading underlying natural causes of death in 2006 in which HIV was number 9 and directed a number of questions to his critics:
As you will have seen from the above , what Statssa recorded as deaths from “HIV disease” came 9th in terms of the leading causes of death in South Africa in 2006, as indeed it did also in the preceding years.
I am convinced that it would be perfectly understandable that the normal, thinking African would ask the questions:
Why did it come about that so much noise was made internationally about the 9th leading cause of death in our country, with not even so much as a whimper about the 1st leading cause of death, tuberculosis?
Why would the South African Government, knowing the health condition of its own population very well, have been expected so to focus on the 9th leading cause of death as virtually to treat as less urgent and important the first eight (8) leading causes of death, even taken together?
Did this have to do with the fact that South Africa could be a lucrative market for the sale of ARVs, as it now is?
An attempt to reframe his presidency'
Responding to Mbeki's article, Katherine Furman, a PhD candidate in philosophy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, theorized what influenced Mbeki to take the actions that he did while president:
The international scientific community made its disagreement with him explicit in the form of the Durban Declaration, a petition signed by more than 5000 scientists that endorsed the mainstream scientific view on HIV and AIDS.
It is clear that Mbeki should have taken the objections from scientists seriously, given that they are the experts.
But part of what went wrong in the Mbeki case was that he was confused about who exactly the real scientific experts were.
He believed that the denialist scientists he supported were an oppressed minority group who had been unfairly treated by the scientific community – a feeling that was all too familiar to him emerging from the struggle against apartheid.
We could concede, albeit grudgingly, that maybe Mbeki’s confusion was understandable under the circumstances.
But even when presented with the Durban Declaration, Mbeki didn’t step back and re-examine his views.
This is an astonishing response.
Following the publication of Mbeki's article, Kerry Cullinan, managing editor for health news site Health-e.org, said Mbeki made it clear he has no remorse for his policies:
I have often wondered whether former president Thabo Mbeki has regretted his stance on HIV and AIDS, given the remarkable increase in our life expectancy since he was bundled out of power.
But today, I wondered no more as Mbeki reiterated many of his bizarre beliefs on AIDS on his website as part of a series of letters he has been writing in an attempt to reframe his presidency.
While every year under Mbeki saw a decrease in our life expectancy by a year, once he was ousted and the new government adopted an aggressive approach to combatting HIV including widespread access to antiretroviral (ARV) medicine, life expectancy has grown each year by a year.
Sanele Sano Ngcobo, a University of Pretoria junior lecturer, challenged Mbeki on the ARVs question:
Your article is indirectly denying the proven facts that antiretrovirals (ARVs) have saved lives of many South Africans.
I would like to share few ARV success stories with you.
In 2005, life expectancy in South Africa was 51 years and today it is 61 years.
Zimbabwe’s life expectancy in 2000 was 44 years and today it is 60 years.
Both South Africa and Zimbabwe introduced massive ARV programmes.
Due to ARVs, HIV-related deaths went down by:
58 percent in South Africa 71 percent in Ethiopia 64 percent in Thailand, and 87 percent in Senegal.
All these countries started massive ARV programmes.
What more proof do we need that ARVs are saving lives of our people?
You have argued that the US pharmaceutical companies wanted to benefits from provision of ARVs, however on 19 April 2001 your government successfully protected a law allowing the domestic production of cheaper, generic medicines – including ARVs – against a lawsuit filed by transnational pharmaceutical companies.
Why didn’t you invest in domestic companies to produce ARVs?
A simple apology...would have sufficed'
Commenting on the issue on Twitter, Africa is a Country simply said:
We're going to pretend we did not see former South African President Thabo Mbeki recycle his HIV/AIDS denialism again. — AFRICA IS A COUNTRY (@AfricasaCountry) March 7, 2016
While Muzi Maseko advised the former president to apologise:
A simple apology from former President Mbeki, on his denialism about HIV causing AIDS which to 300 000 deaths, would have sufficed. — Muzi_Maseko (@liNgcamane) March 9, 2016
However, Mbeki has got supporters as well.
Nande N tried to explain Mbeki's position to his critics:
Mbeki's dissidents wasn't centered on the denial of AIDS existence but rather what were the causative stages & linkages between HIV & AIDS. — Nande N (@nandnz) March 3, 2016
Msizi James wanted discussions about the former president to be about his other good leadership qualities:
Let's talk about how good Mbeki was.
Apart from not believing AIDS was a real problem #SONA2016 — I'm Msizi James (@msizijames) February 11, 2016
Another user seemed to suggest that it is difficult for AIDS experts to challenge Mbeki's claim:
All these pedestrian HIV/Aids ‘experts’ who scream “Aids denialist” will find it difficult to refute what Mbeki is saying on the matter. — #ConceptSixty5 (@Sentletse) March 7, 2016
Two independent AIDS researchers, Anthony Brink and Chris Rawiins, who also dispute the scientific consensus on the link between HIV and AIDS, have come out in support of Mbeki's article.
The King of Congolese Rumba Has Died.
Papa Wemba, December 30, 2015.

African music legend Papa Wemba passed away on April 24, 2016, in Abidjan, after collapsing on stage during one of his performances.
He played an active role in popularising Congolese rumba on the international music scene, and he was also known for mentoring other African music stars, including Koffi Olomidé and King Kester Emeneya.
Three days of national mourning were declared following his death, and a national funeral was held on May 4, 2016, at Our Lady of the Congo Cathedral in Kinshasa.
More than a thousand people reportedly attended the ceremony:
Despite being renowned amongst African music lovers, he is still not very well known outside Africa.
If you have just discovered this African legend, here are four highlights in his career full of achievements.
A Man of Perpetual Musical Innovation
Papa Wemba was dubbed the King of Congolese Rumba, a continuously evolving genre that has given rise to other styles such as Soukous and Ndombolo.
As its name indicates, Congolese rumba has roots in Cuban rumba, which arrived in Congo in the 1930s.
Below is a video from the show “Africanités”, broadcast on TV5 Monde, illustrating the music's history with a selection of hits:
Papa Wemba's and his colleagues' contribution to the evolution of Congolese rumba in the 1970s was manifold, when the genre came to favor percussion instruments over wind instruments, as well as a quicker tempo, blending more strongly local trends with rumba's Cuban origins.
The American and European Tour with Peter Gabriel
In 1993, Papa Wemba toured North America and Europe on the “Secret World Live Tour” alongside Peter Gabriel, who was at the time one of the music industry's biggest stars.
The international recognition was huge for Papa Wemba.
Here the two artists can be seen performing “In Your Eyes” at a concert.
(Papa Wemba begins to sing in Lingala at 7:40.)
Peter Gabriel is as well known for his musical career as for his human rights activism, notably through the organisation he founded, called WITNESS.
Peter Gabriel attended Papa Wemba's funeral in almost complete anonymity.
Timeless Hits
Throughout his 40-year career, Papa Wemba recorded many popular hits.
Here is a selection of his most famous songs:
Yolele:
Maria Valencia:
Show Me the Way:
Papa Wemba was also famous for collaborating with many African stars, such as Koffi Olomide, notably for the song “Wake Up”:
With Extra Musica on Etat Major:
A Cultural Impact Beyond Music
In the 1970s, Papa Wemba created a movement called “SAPE”, which is an acronym for the Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Elégantes (or Society of Ambiance-ists and People of Elegance).
(This is the origin of the expression "sapé" in French, which is slang for a loudly but still well-dressed individual.)
Papa Wemba liked to dress extravagantly and, by the middle of his career, he was also called the King of Sape.
Congo is now known as the world's leading “sape” country, thanks in large part to Papa Wemba.
The following documentary details the origins of the 'King of Sape' nickname:
And so we have lost Papa Wemba, a Congolese rumba pioneer and the “King of Sape”.
“Farewell to the artist and thank you,” says Global Voices.

Shan State’s upland areas are typically cooler than the arid regions of central and lower Myanmar, although this year, much like the rest of the country, it has suffered from an unusually powerful El Niño weather pattern.
In southern Shan State, springs and lakes used by local communities to store rainwater for domestic as well as farming purposes have been dry since February, leaving many villagers facing water shortages that are even worse than those in previous years.
Tun Kyi, the head of Kalaw Township’s Le Gaung Village, explains the situation in their area:
The lake near our village dried up two months ago.
Last year, we were able to use water from there until March.
To tackle water scarcity, some local charities, such as the Brighter Future Myanmar Foundation, have started to distribute drinking water to villages.
The foundation, the only in Shan State digging wells in hard-hit areas, has been collaborating with Myanmar’s government since 2014, receiving machines to drill into the mainly limestone Shan plateau.
The foundation says that it has recently spent US$1.5 million to buy their own new drilling equipment and that they have dug over 100 wells in Shan State to date.

In this edition, Global Voices News Editor Lauren Finch and I — Managing Editor at Global Voices– take you to China, Mexico, Jamaica, Macedonia and Uganda.
In China, we tell you about Chinese dissidents being horrified after Twitter hired a former Chinese military officer to develop their business strategy in the greater China region.
Oiwan Lam brought our attention to this story.
Then we head to Mexico to a story brought to us by our partner Sin Embargo, where the Mexican government's favorite contractor is displacing an indigenous community to build a highway.
Next, we set our sights on Jamaica, where our author Emma Lewis wrote a story about students at Deaf Can! Coffee who learn how to make coffee and also learn how to run all aspects of the business.
On to Macedonia, where the streets are full of protesters demanding justice. Our contributor Goran Rizaof reported the story.
Finally, we’re off to Uganda, where people are peeved at their government's perceived priorities. The country's only radiotherapy machine for cancer treatment recently broke down.
It used to serve over 27 thousand patients every year, but it’s now beyond repair. Our contributor Prudence Nyamishana joins the podcast to tell us more about why Ugandans are upset and what a porn detector machine has to do with it.
In this episode of the Week that Was at Global Voices, we featured Creative Commons licensed music from the Free Music Archive, including Please Listen Carefully by Jahzzar; Twitterpated by Floating Spirits; Gladiator by Tommy Tornado; Good Riddance by Ars Sonor; Highway 101 by Josh Spacek; and Sex and Lucia by Gary Lucas.

HiviSasa, Swahili for "right now", is a Kenyan digital media project publishing news and photos from citizen reporters who are paid via M-Pesa, a mobile payment system, for every article published.
Some citizen reporters, according to the site, earn up to about US $85 per week.
The project also awards writers whose articles attract the highest number of pageviews with cash prize every week.
The website currently covers 10 counties in the country: Nakuru, Kiambu, Machakos, Kisii, Nyamira, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, Garissa, Mombasa and Kibera.

HiviSasa explains its ethos on its website:
Accessible, diverse, transparent information empowers both governments and citizens.
Better informed citizens make better decisions about their lives and their government.
Registration to be a contributor for the site takes less than a minute and one does not need to be a trained journalist to write for HiviSasa:
You can be a professional, an organisation, a student, a government officer, a politician, a concerned citizen, a cartoonist, a businessman, a bystander… etc.
Also, many trained journalists also contribute, which increases their skills and online exposure.
Write a 200-words news story (or submit a new photo with a short description) answering the questions: What event?
Where and when did it happen?
Who was involved?
How did the event occur?
Why is it noteworthy?
The site has identified three examples of good local stories for new writers.
One of the stories is about a Kenyan man, Lawrence Gekonge, who buried his wife in the kitchen after she passed away because she used to spend most of her time there.The man says that he should be buried in the sitting room of the main house when he dies.
The second story is about citizen reporter, Dickens Luvanda, who has managed to consistently publish over 50 stories a week.
The third one is about 1,200 title deeds lying uncollected at the Lands Registry.
The project's lead editor Enoch Nyariki told Global Voices in an email conversation that the site has so far published 61,000 stories.
He said that one of the main challenges the project is facing is having citizen reporters take advantage of free HiviSasa Academy they have set up to empower reporters with basic news writing skills. The YouTube video below is an introduction to the academy in Sheng, a mixture of Swahili and English:
The academy offers various free lessons such as How To Interview, How to Report Court Stories, Writing Lawfully - Plagiarism/Accreditation, Writing Lawfully - Defamation/Libel, Hate Speech, etc.
Piloted in 2012 with the support of 88mph, which invests in start-ups, the project was launched in January 2014.
Other investors in the project are Omidyar Network and Novastar Ventures.
Editor's note: Global Voices also receives support from Omidyar Network.
Oops!
Facebook joined Filipinos in celebrating the Philippine Independence Day.
However, it unintentionally inverted the country's flag.
June 12 is Independence Day in the Philippines.
The Philippines declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898 after more than 300 years of colonial rule.
In honor of this special day, Facebook greeted Filipinos by displaying the Philippine flag.
However, the flag was inverted which is only done when the country is at war.
Philippine Star newspaper quickly noticed the mistake:
LOOK: In honor of Philippine Independence Day, Facebook's home page greets Filipino netizens with a banner of the Philippine flag—except that it's displayed with the red part at the top and the blue at the bottom, signifying the country is in a state of war.
Filipino Facebook users are laughing over this mistake although majority are grateful Facebook remembered to send its Independence Day greetings.
However, there are also netizens who criticized Facebook for incorrectly displaying the Philippine flag.
Below are some reactions on Facebook and Twitter:
Facebook user Berniemack Arellano asks if the error is a movie marketing ploy:
Dear Facebook,
Has the President and the Congress declared war on some country?
Ano to, marketing ng Independence Day: Resurgence?
Has the President and the Congress declared war on some country?
Facebook says we're at war.
Happy Independence Day, Philippines.
Dear @facebook: It's not a happy Independence Day if our flag is like this.
This is the correct way to display the Philippine flag.
In the country’s history, the red banner was last displayed at the top during the Second World War in 1941 to 1945.

Je suis pineapple, or I am pineapple.
Via Mirana (with permission)
When it comes to memes, pineapple is the new orange, at least in Madagascar.
Social media in Madagascar has become quite pineapple-flavored over the past few days.
Why the sudden fervor for the spiky fruit?
Here is a bit of context on the current social situation on the Red Island.
Madagascar came up as the world's poorest country in one of the poverty indices published by the World Bank (and reported by media outlets such as Radio France Internationale).
The criticism of the economic status of the country did not sit well with the president of Madagascar.
He challenged observers, local media and citizens to "provide evidence that the country was getting poorer."
Malagasy netizens quickly obliged in a biting manner:
Is this graph here not enough evidence Mr President ? #Madagascar #WASH
Koolsaina, a Malagasy community blog, posted the following photo on its website:
Malagasy citizens going through trash pile ups in Antananarivo.
Via Koolsaina
Following that first tense exchange between the president and Malagasy netizens, another Malagasy community website, Tananews, posted a photo of First Lady Voahangy Rajaonarimampianina wearing a a green dress with a pineapple motif on the front:
The Malagasy president and the first lady at an independence day ceremony.
Via Tananews
Tananews added a link and a comment with a hint of sarcasm that said, "Indeed, not everyone is poor in Madagascar."
The link showed that the dress was probably designed by high-end clothing brand Dolce & Gabana that sold for US $7,745 on the website of department store Nieman Marcus (it is unclear whether that is the actually cost of the dress that the first lady was wearing).
The outrage was swift on the Malagasy web.
A flurry of memes with the hashtag #mananasy (pineapple) appeared within days on various Malagasy websites and social media.
Here are a few memes that were widely shared:
Spoof of Facebook founder Marc Zuckerberg's profile wondering about pineapples in Madagascar.
The meme reads, " Do you know how to wear Pineapple as they do in Antananarivo ? (play on word with a traditional folk song)" Used with permission.
Beggar: "Can I have US $7,000 please?"
First lady: "I have no pineapple for you."
Via the POV Facebook page
"New pineapple haircut because I want to be famous too."
Via Rivo Francis on Facebook
"Did you know that the brand Dolce & Ananas was all the rage in Madagascar?"
"Anana" means pineapple in French.

Tragically, all the jokes about pineapple came a few days after tragedy struck the country's independence day ceremony. A grenade exploded into the crowd watching the military parade in the national stadium, killing three people and injuring 91.
Here is a video of the aftermath:
The whole conversation on "Pineapple-Gate" comes at a time when a major bill on freedom of speech and ethics online is being prepared by Malagasy authorities.
The early returns from insiders on how the bill will shape up hint that it will severely restrict free expression online and will include heavy fines for any materials deemed to be libel.
The bill should be submitted to the parliament for approval in the coming weeks.

Renna Ramadan prepared an iftar meal for her family, Syrians from Idlib who hoped to reach Northern Europe but instead are living in the passenger waiting area at Piraeus Port Terminal 1 in Athens, Greece.
Several hundred refugees and migrants remain at Piraeus, long after Greek authorities vowed to move the people to other camps.

This article by Jeanne Carstensen originally appeared on PRI.org on June 10, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
On the first night of Ramadan, residents of the informal tent camp at Piraeus port in Athens line up for special meals to break their fast.
As the sun sets behind the massive ferries that take travelers to the Greek islands, hundreds of hot, tired refugees line up in front of a trailer in a vast parking lot.
They haven’t eaten or had a drink of water since about 4 a.m.
It’s clear the Greek government is trying to support the refugees during Ramadan.
But even so, conditions at Piraeus are abysmal.
Hedda Grew, a volunteer with the NGO Team Sweden, says the Ramadan fasting is only increasing tensions among people who are already desperate about their circumstances.
"They can't drink, they can't eat, they're just sitting in their hot tents all day, and it's a combination between the Ramadan and the waiting," she says.
And there’s an awful lot of waiting.
I walk to a quieter area of the camp where I meet Amal Herh, a beautiful young mother of four from Aleppo.
Her name means "Hope" in English.
"I have a lot of hope," she says. "But now I must be strong, more strong, for my family."
Amal is putting on a positive face, but I can see the distress in her eyes.
She tells me that Ramadan makes her long for home.
"I want to go to Aleppo for Ramadan, with cooking and some cold water and a good place, not this," she says.
"Some good fruit, not orange every day.
You don't love the same food every day, yes?"
I tell her I understand.
That people tell me that Ramadan is a very happy time of year, with family, and special food.
"Yes," she says. "But I don't say what I can say to you, because I am very sad now, because I remember my house."
The next night I accept an invitation to a very different Iftar meal with Anna Stamou, a Greek woman who converted to Islam, and her husband, Naim el Ghandour, president of the Muslim Association of Greece.
Naim was born in Egypt.
The Ramadan app on his phone signals sundown with a recording of a call to prayer.
At the table, there's playful banter about whether the salad is Egyptian or Greek.
Over Iftar dinner Anna translates for Naim as he speaks Greek.
He’s sad for the thousands of Muslim refugee having to celebrate Ramadan in the camps.
But he tells me he’s glad to see Yannis Mouzalas, the Greek minister of migration, is making an effort to show support during Ramadan.
"It's very encouraging for us," he says.
The refugees are in a terrible situation in Greece.
But Naim, who fled his native Egypt in 1967, is grateful that they are at least away from the violence.
"They are way better than if they were there and maybe a bomb would be in their heads right now and they would celebrate no Ramadan, no nothing," he says.
But the best Ramadan blessing would be to end the fighting.
"I wish there would be a solution with Europe to stop the war," he says. "Because this is the issue — to stop the war.
All of them want to go back.
We certainly wish that next Ramadan will find us without war."
Later I keep thinking about Amal in her tent back in Piraeus.
It’s not easy to feel your dignity slipping away, especially during the holidays.
I wish I could bring her cool water and freshly peeled oranges from Aleppo for Ramadan.

Armelle Nina Sitchoma reported on the first African Bloggers and Vloggers’ Festival (FABY, for its initials in French), which took place 3-5 June 2016 at La Place du Souvenir in Dakar, Senegal.
The blogger, who is from Douala, Cameroon, wrote on her website that the two-day festival attracted 36 of the "best" bloggers and vloggers from around Africa as well as other digital figures.
They gave presentations on African digital content and the economic opportunities to be found on the African web.
She continued:
The two days of discussions were arranged around two panel discussions: “Big Data: What place is there for African content?” moderated by web 2.0 consultant Aboubacar Sadikh Ndiaye, and “The Future of Video in Africa” moderated by Mountaga Cissé from Senegal.
The panels included well-known bloggers and vloggers such as Edith Brou from Ivory Coast, Yassine Massouath from Morocco, and Mountaga Cissé from Senegal, who spoke on the theme of “How to succeed on the internet: Job opportunities in an IT world.”
Whilst Annie Payep from Cameroon, Ameyaw from Ghana, and Alexandre Lette and NK Thiat from Senegal led a workshop on “Ensuring quality content”.
African success stories, such as that of Aisha Dème of the website Agendakar, were shared with the audience.
There were also exhibition stands featuring make up – Fashion from Sylvia Njoki (Kenya) and Mode & Beauté from Aba of Senegal – and cooking, video games, education and comedy were also covered and the first African Bloggers & Vloggers’ Festival

Tanzanian citizen Isaac Abakuki Emily was convicted of insulting Tanzanian President John Magufuli on his Facebook page by the Arusha Resident Magistrate’s Court.
Emily first appeared in court on April 15, 2016 on charges of "insulting" the country's president, John Magufuli, allegedly contrary to Section 16 of Tanzania's Cybercrime Act No. 14 of 2015, which says:
Any person who publishes information, data or facts presented in a picture, text, symbol or any other form in a computer system where such information, data or fact is false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate commits an offence, and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not less than three million shillings or to imprisonment for a term not less than six months or to both.
He was accused of posting the controversial Facebook message, written in Swahili, on March 17, 2015, despite knowing that posting false or misleading statements about the country's president is against the law.
His comment was in reference to President Magufuli's surprise live call to 360, a current affairs program on Clouds TV.
While on the air, the president thanked the presenters and expressed his admiration for the show.
Neither Emily's personal Facebook page, nor the discussion page on which he is reported to have posted the comment, have come up in searches, but his Facebook comment allegedly read:
Theatrics in politics , how come you compare this imbecile to Nyerere ?
His conviction comes against the backdrop of Tanzania's relatively new cybercrime bill, which the Parliament passed on April 1, 2015, to address cybercrime issues such as child pornography, cyberbullying, online impersonation, electronic production of racist and xenophobic content, spam, illegal interception of communications, and the publication of false information.
Despite widespread opposition from politicians, social media experts, and human rights activists, the bill was pushed through parliament with relatively little discussion or debate.
Former president Jakaya Kikwete signed it into law in May 2015.
They have also cautioned that police or the state could use their power to harass online activists or social media users.
That same month, another netizen, Sospiter Jonas, was arraigned in a primary court in Dodoma Region and charged with “misuse of the Internet” after he posted a message on Facebook saying that Tanzanian Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda “will only become a gospel preacher.”
The four appeared before a Magistrate's court in Dar Es Salaam on November 6, 2015.
Public prosecutors alleged that the accused published audio information on a WhatsApp group called the "Soka Group", that was intended to mislead the public during the October 2015 Tanzanian general elections, which were plagued by accusations of vote-rigging.
A screenshot of Samson Tusiime's Facebook post.
Twitter in Uganda was buzzing on Sunday, 29 May with the hashtag #FreeSamwyiri.
The Twitter campaign followed the arrest of a Ugandan man named Samson Tusiime allegedly for wearing and distributing T-shirts bearing the photo of Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye.
Police allege that he was organizing "illegal" demonstrations and had plans of distributing similar T-shirts countrywide.
According to Uganda's Independent newspaper, two other Ugandans, Ismail Muyinda and Asia Nanyanzi, were also arrested.
Tusiime had posted a message on Facebook on 28 May wearing the T-shirt in question, saying he was looking for his friend Ysmyl Muyinda (presumed to be the same Ismail Muyinda reported as arrested above), whose company produced and printed them.
He wrote that he had gone to different police stations looking for his friend.
When friends noticed that Tusiime himself had gone missing, they started a hashtag #FreeSamwyiri.
Police later confirmed that he was arrested.
The case has agitated many Ugandans, who are in shock that a T-shirt could be enough to arrest someone.
Joel Nevender, a Ugandan blogger, asked the police:
You're arresting @Samwyri for exercising his freedom of expression?
Because of t-shirts?
T-shirts? #FreeSamwyri — Joel B Ntwatwa (@nevender) May 29, 2016
While Ogutu Daudi tweeted:
Can we come out and stop calling this a democracy because it isn't.
Bloody tshirts.
Put us in yellow jumpsuits why don't you. #freesamwyri — iamogutudaudi (@iamogutudaudi) May 29, 2016
In recent months, Ugandan authorities have been especially intolerant of criticism.
President Yoweri Museveni won a controversial fifth term in office in February 2016 in an election that the country's political opposition claims was rigged.
Opposition members and other activists have been challenging Museveni's victory with a series of protests they've dubbed the “defiance campaign.”
Since the February election, authorities have arrested Kizza Besigye and other opposition figures multiple times as well as blocked social media twice in the interest of "national security".
After Tusiime's arrest, Josephine Karungi wondered:
Some things are terribly hard to spin...ati now we arrested him because why...you can't really say it was the tee shirt can you? — Josephine Karungi (@jkkarungi) May 30, 2016
Patoraking, a university student, thought that this act was worse than the days of Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator who ruled Uganda from 1971 until 1979:
Our parents can nolonger even tell us "During Amin's time, ....." because this time we r in is even worse than Amin's time #FreeSamwyri — Patoranking (@pyepar) May 29, 2016
Chapter Four Uganda, a legal aid organisation, responded to the outcry by sending their legal team to the police station:
Our officer is at SIU Kireka to obtain a statement from @Samwyri for appropriate legal action #FreeSamwyri — Chapter Four Uganda (@chapter4uganda) May 30, 2016
SIU Kireka stands for Special Investigation Unit at Kireka in the capital Kampala.
It is not yet known which exact charges will be laid against him.
However, Qatahar Raymond, a Ugandan journalist who has been following Tusiime's case since he was arrested, speculated that he might be charged for inciting violence.
We learn that @Samwyri and his friend will likely be charged with 'inciting violence' if they are charged, that is. — Qatahar Raymond (@qataharraymond) May 30, 2016
A single blog post changed the life of this Somali mother of 8. Photo by Somali Faces (Donia and Mohammed).
Used with permission.
On May 1, Somali Faces covered a story about a poor Somali mother who is an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) and has eight small children, none of whom were attending school.
She was facing abuse for belonging to a minority Somali clan and because of her dark skin.
She was contemplating suicide.
Sometimes I’m treated like a foreigner in my own country, like I don’t belong here.
I’m a single mother of 8 and none of my children are at school.
I clean houses whilst carrying the child I’m carrying now.
The rest of my children look for any type of work that they can find.
I know it’s a hard life and it’s not easy but what makes it so much harder and at times unbearable is how people treat me and my children.
I sometimes feel like I’m in an ocean of people whose hearts are made of stone.
Many discriminate against me because of my very dark skin colour.
I tell them, that’s how God created me and I can’t change it.
Either they reject me because I’m from a minority clan or because of my skin colour.
Sometimes, I contemplate whether death is better for us than living in a wretched life.
Readers were moved by her story, and began a fundraiser for her.
A total of $4,000 was raised in 21 hours.
After the donations, Somali Faces reported:
Your donations changed her family’s life.
Because of you, she will have her own shop, her house will be repaired and she told us that with the money she will be making, she can easily pay for her children’s education.
You couldn’t conceal her smile and happiness, at times; she had difficulty getting the words out.
Never in a million years did she imagine that she would receive this amount of money.
A week ago, she was discriminated against, hopeless and penniless and now, she has a continuous source of income for her family.
We thank each every one of you for your unrelenting generosity and efforts to change this mother’s life.
Somali Faces made sure that every dollar you sent was spent towards her family and we were involved every step when it came to the materials and how the money will be managed.
We would like to thank Tadamun Social Society (TAAS) for their tremendous help.
We will be monitoring her progress and will provide you with a video update 3 to 6 months from now on how her and her beautiful children are doing.
Somali Faces is an online project that shares everyday stories of ordinary Somali people from around the world.
The idea was the brainchild of the creative duo of Donia Jamal Adam, a storyteller, human rights advocate and campaigner; and Mohammed Ibrahim Shire, an author and history enthusiast.
Statement of offence shared on Twitter by @samirasawlani.
Tanzanian citizen Leonard Mulokozi was charged on June 22 under Tanzania's Electronic and Postal Communications Act over a WhatsApp message that authorities say is "abusive" to Tanzanias president, John Magufuli.
Mulokozi denied the charge at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court and was released on bail.
The case will come up for mention on July 18.
It is alleged that on June 2 Mulokozi posted the following message, in Swahili, on WhatsApp:
Does it mean this Pombe Magufuli doesn't have advisers?
Is he unadvisable?
Or is he just a fool?
He's real foolish, this fellow: he doesn't consider the applicable laws before opening his mouth; or does he also suffer from an illness like that of Mnyika?
Mulokozi is the latest victim of Tanzania's relatively new Cybercrime Law, which the Parliament passed in April 2015 to address issues such as child pornography, cyberbullying, online impersonation, illegal interception of communications, and the publication of false information.
Despite widespread opposition from politicians, social media experts, and human rights activists, the bill was pushed through parliament with relatively little discussion or debate.
Former president Jakaya Kikwete signed it into law in May 2015.
They have also cautioned that police or the state could use their power to harass online activists or social media users.
Tanzanian citizen Isaac Abakuki Emily was convicted this month of insulting Tanzanian President John Magufuli on his Facebook page by the Arusha Resident Magistrate’s Court.
Emily may serve three years in prison, or alternatively pay a fine of five million shillings (US $2300), a steep sum in Tanzania, where the GDP per capita amounts to just under US $1000 per year.
This was reduced from seven million upon appeal by his lawyer, according to local news site The Citizen.
He must pay the fine by August 8, or serve the prison term.
The four appeared before a Magistrate's court in Dar Es Salaam on November 6, 2015.
Public prosecutors alleged that the accused published audio information on a WhatsApp group called the "Soka Group", that was intended to mislead the public during the October 2015 Tanzanian general elections, which were plagued by accusations of vote-rigging.
A few weeks ago, Masonga Kitanda Olivier, a 23-year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was beaten to death by three men in South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj area.
Olivier had moved to India for university studies and had recently started teaching French in a private institute.
His attackers allegedly used racial slurs as they assaulted him.
It was far from being the only recent case of violence against African people in India.
On May 25, a Nigerian student, 26-year-old Bamilola Kazim, was hit with an iron rod after an altercation over a parking issue with a local in the city of Hyderabad.
He was treated at a local hospital and released.
And in January, a 21-year-old Tanzanian woman studying in India was beaten, stripped and paraded naked in the streets of the city of Bangalore by a mob because they incorrectly thought her car had run over and killed a local woman.
Three of her friends were also assaulted and the car they were traveling in was set on fire.
After they were done, the enraged horde went to houses where African students live and harassed them.
Throughout the last years, similar attacks targeting African nationals and people of African descent have continually made headlines.
So does that mean India has a problem with racism against Africans?
Not if you ask India's Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj, who was reluctant to categorize the Masonga Kitanda Olivier's killing as racist.
Swaraj assured that the assault was carried out by anti-social elements and argued that giving the case a racial tinge would be unfair to the people of India, who generally believe in harmonious cohabitation.
I would like to assure African students in India that this an unfortunate and painful incident involving local goons. — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) 25 May 2016
Swaraj took to Twitter to urge Indians to tell Africans that India loves them and shake their hand.
However, many found it naive or hypocritical, in the face of recent violence against Africans as well as the discrimination that persists in other sectors of Indian society.
Even after 70 years of Independence, we can't even make the Indians love each other, and they want us to tell Africans that we love them. — Mr. Tippler (@MrTippler) June 2, 2016

40 envoys almost boycott Africa Day
Africans go on camera recounting racism in India.
And minister blames media.
Some Africans have recounted their experiences with racism to various media outlets.
In a June 4 article for Scroll.in, a South African student of South Asian origin talked about subtle forms of racial and cultural stereotypes that exist in India:
It was also not uncommon for many students to have conversations with me, which they assumed were progressive, about Africa and Africans that were based on crude colonial stereotypes of Africans as being close to nature, having a good sense of rhythm or even, and possibly the most colonial, having big penises.
While many of the students at JNU had an impressively extensive knowledge of their own colonial, independence and post-independence cultural, political, social and religious, and regional histories, as well as knowledge of western theory and philosophy, and were committed to an idea of Left politics that took ideas like South-South solidarity seriously, their knowledge of African social, political and cultural histories as well as present realities was limited.
There have been protests too.
For example, after the killing of Obodo Uzoma Simeon, a 36-year-old Nigerian citizen, outside an African restaurant in Parra in the state of Goa in 2013, more than 50 Nigerians blocked the highway.
They stopped the hearse carrying Simeon and dragged his body on the road as a way to draw attention to the case and prevent a cover-up of the murder.
Authorities, however, answered their protest by cracking down on undocumented Nigerians, a campaign that seemed to only make anti-African sentiment worse.
The negativity continued after Masonga Kitanda Olivier's murder.
In response to an alleged rape case involving a Nigerian national, Goa's tourism minister publicly accused Nigerians of committing crime on purpose to prolong their stays in India.
"We should have a strict law where we can deport them.
But unfortunately there is no such law in India at the moment," he said.
There is little doubt that the series of attacks on African individuals have disgraced India in front of the international community and has strained its ties with African countries.
In an effort to reverse the dismal situation, Sushma Swaraj has sought to provide assurances to African ambassadors and individuals in India alike.
A group of African students called off a demonstration in the national capital as a result.
Hopefully, the country will soon be on the path to peace and security for Africans as well as for all marginalized communities in India.
Belarusian Internet users stripped in their workplaces to respond to the President's call to put more effort into their work.
Image from Instagram.
Belarusian citizens are not usually known to enthusiastically heed the commands of their long-time president Alyaksandr Lukashenka.
In fact, his authoritarian monopoly on ruling Belarus is frowned upon.
But as it turns out, there are exceptions to every rule.
On June 22, Lukashenka spoke at the All-Belarusian people's meeting, and, ending his speech, issued a call to Belarusians seeking a better life.
Our life is about simple things.
We must get undressed and get to work.
Work till we sweat.
If we don't, we'll perish.
The video of Lukashenka's speech made the rounds on social media, with disbelieving users trying to confirm that he had indeed used the word "to strip" (раздеваться) and not the similar-sounding "to develop " (развиваться).
But the transcript of the speech on the presidential website confirmed it.
And so the Belarusians took to the task with gusto.
Soon, social media were flooded with photos and videos of (mostly young) Belarusians in their offices and workplaces, stark naked, strategically covering themselves with binders, office tables, laptops, and going about their workday.
Belarusian urban news website CityDog collected the best specimens of the social network flashmob.
Batka (Lukashenko's nickname) said we should get naked and work, so we got naked and are working.
We'll follow the advice as well))
Anything to prop up the country's economy.
Thousands of Belarusians have been posting pictures on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter using the hashtag #раздеватьсяиработать (#getnakedandwork).
I weeded the strawberries today.
And how have you fulfilled the state's command?
The flashmob became so popular that even users from other countries on the RuNet and beyond joined in.
Supporting the Belarusian flashmob!
Japan is experiencing a bit of a love affair with the capybara, the large, hamster-like rodent with a gentle disposition and a preference for hot spring baths.
The video "scratching many capybaras" has so far racked up more the 1.2 million views:
The main attraction of the website is a "capybara navigator" that shows where to find the hamster-like rodent in prefectures all over Japan.
The page's Twitter account has some amusing images as well:
I went and saw the capybaras at Reoma Resort (in Kagawa on the island of Shikoku), and I'll be flying back home today.
I'll provide an update on my blog.
The most popular video on the YouTube channel shows a capybara jumping from a pool:
Capybaras, which are native to South America, are well-known in Japan thanks to the popular cartoon character Kapibara-san.

Donald Trump's presidential campaign has always advocated “getting tough on Iran,” but the rhetoric escalated ever so slightly last week, when retired Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn, one of Trump's chief military advisors and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, demanded that Ayatollah Khomeini—a man who's been dead for more than a quarter of a century—condemn the attack on July 14 in Nice, France.
Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, calls on a man dead 27 years to condemn extremism pic.twitter.com/qhtxOYeHce — Samuel Oakford (@samueloakford) July 15, 2016
Appearing on Fox News with Megyn Kelly, Flynn said angrily, “I want the Imam, or Khomeini, to stand up and be counted and to talk about this radical form of ideology in their bloodstream, in their DNA."
Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhollah Khomeini died in 1989 after establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran, the first modern-day theocracy, following the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Flynn either confused the name “Khomeini” with Iran's current supreme leader, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei, or he is unaware that Ayatollah Khomeini died 27 years ago.
Whether the mistake was confusion or ignorance, Flynn appeared on Fox News again the following day, on July 15, and said Khomeini again, insisting that the long-dead man denounce the attacks in Nice.
Internet users both in Iran and the US have shared a few thoughts about Flynn's curious interest in “the Imam Khomeini."
Iranian Twitter user Ameneh Mousavi tweeted:
Wise people, can this be right?
General Michael Flynn, Donald Trump's military advisor, wants "Ayatollah Khomeini," the leader of Iran, to condemn the Nice terrorist attacks.

As if by magic, Google Maps changed some town names in Crimea overnight.
Images edited by Tetyana Lokot.
On July 27 Internet giant Google renamed a number of towns, villages, and settlements in Crimea—a peninsula in Ukraine that has been under Russian control since early 2014—on their Google Maps service.
The change came after the Ukrainian parliament altered the names of 70 geographic locations in Crimea in accordance with its “decommunization” campaign in May 2016.
Users of the Russian and Ukrainian versions of Google Maps noticed the differences immediately.
For instance, according to a report by Meduza news website, the town of Krasnoperekopsk became “Yany Kapu,” Sovetskoe turned into “Ichki,” and Kirovskoe was changed to “Islyam-Terek.”
Many of the new names have Crimean Tatar origin or other historic roots, replacing the Soviet-era variants.
The change on Google Maps immediately provoked a backlash from Russian and Crimean officials.
The head of annexed Crimea Sergey Aksyonov accused Google in a Facebook post of "producing a propagandistic product" and of "trying to create their own reality."
Russian communications minister Nikolay Nikiforov also joined in the criticism, saying that if Google didn't stick to Russian laws and the Russian names of towns and villages (in Crimea), it would "prevent the company from doing effective business in Russia."
Ukrainian foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin reacted to the backlash on Twitter, referring to what Ukraine believes to be illegal occupation of Crimea by Russia:
Renaming the stolen is a house of cards: it is bound to collapse under the weight of truth. #CrimeaIsUkraine — Pavlo Klimkin (@PavloKlimkin) July 28, 2016
On July 28, a spokesperson for Google told RBC news website that they were aware of the changes made in accordance with Ukraine's "decommunization" law and of Russia's displeasure.
Google told RBC they were "actively working to restore the previous version of the names on the Russian version of Google Maps."
The Ukrainian government lost control of the Crimean peninsula in the spring of 2014, following a disputed referendum on seceding from Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation.
Most of the world does not recognize Russia's subsequent annexation of the territory of Crimea.

After the Department of Justice in the United States filed lawsuits accusing Malaysian officials and their associates for laundering more than one billion US dollars through American institutions, Malaysians are wondering if ‘Malaysian Official 1,’ who is cited 36 times in the 136-page lawsuit, is actually their Prime Minister Najib Razak.
The prime minister controls the 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB) investment firm, which is at the centre of the lawsuit.
His stepson is also one of the accused.
The lawsuit aims to recover 17 assets in the US, which have allegedly been acquired through 1MDB funds.
The lawsuits claims 1MDB funds were spent on hotels, fine art, luxury real estate in New York, Los Angeles, and London, and even on the 2013 Hollywood film “The Wolf of Wall Street.”
This is not the first time that Najib Razak's name has been implicated in a corruption scandal.
Previously, he has been accused of pocketing more than 600 million dollars through anomalous transactions.
After he was linked to several large dollar bank accounts, he claimed the funds were a political donation from a royal family in Saudi Arabia.
US officials said the lawsuit is the “largest single action ever brought under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.”
They vowed to return the funds to the Malaysian people:
The Department of Justice will not allow the American financial system to be used as a conduit for corruption.
With this action, we are seeking to forfeit and recover funds that were intended to grow the Malaysian economy and support the Malaysian people.
Instead, they were stolen, laundered through American financial institutions and used to enrich a few officials and their associates.
Many Malaysians believe the text of the lawsuit provides enough evidence against Najib.
I don't see how MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1 could be anyone other than Najib in US DOJ case against 1MDB pic.twitter.com/z6xPE9OCh8 — Khairil Yusof (@kaerumy) July 20, 2016 #MalaysianOfficial1 Why is it so hard to find this guy? pic.twitter.com/v67tTpNHZa — David Teoh (@dteoh) July 22, 2016
DOJ stands for the US Department of Justice.
Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is calling for the resignation of Najib, urged the US to name Najib in the lawsuit:
If the US really believes in eradicating corruption and money laundering which involves their country, they should not be shy about naming names and letting due process to take place.
When the thief is in charge of the police and the prosecuting agency, only foreign intervention can bring about justice.
Let me clearly and formally declare that I am not the “Malaysian Official 1.” Will the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak similarly state his position – to formally deny it or confirm whether he is referred to as “Malaysian Official 1” and if the latter, what he proposes to do about the DOJ action.
Najib’s camp is insisting that the name of the prime minister is not part of the lawsuit, which means there’s no basis in accusing him of corruption in relation to the 1MDB scandal.
Some supporters of Najib are partly admitting that “Malaysian Official 1” could be referring to the prime minister, but they claim that the information presented by the US government is incorrect.
The hashtag #MalaysianOfficial1 trended after netizens reacted to the US DOJ report.
Some even launched a campaign calling Internet users to search for the real ‘Malaysian Official 1’.

I'm angry that the money is used like a personal bank account.

According to one of Mozambique's most trusted newspapers, Canal de Moçambique, the government has begun installing 450 security cameras in the cities of Maputo and Matola, as part of the “National Ordonnance on Intercepting Information” project, which reportedly includes plans to wiretap the general public.
(Earlier this year in May, Global Voices wrote about Mozambique's controversial plan.)
According to Canal de Moçambique, the government contracted “Msumbiji Investment Limited” to carry out the massive installation, without receiving any alternative offers for the procurement order.
The company, moreover, belongs to former President Armando Guebuza's son, who subcontracted the Chinese firm “ZTE” to perform the actual work, says the newspaper.
Egídio Vaz, a prominent analyst and social media activist, was indignant about the situation:
For more than two months, we have seen news of the big deals of these industrious sons of the fatherland’s hero.
My mood has worsened.
This is bad.
But there is a cure for me.
TO FORGET.
Schauque Spirou addressed the possible consequences of installing surveillance cameras throughout Maputo and Matola, recalling what happened in Brazil:
We are slowly waking up, or we are sleeping and unaware… but there is no doubt that Big Brother is in action… the information given by Canal de Moçambique on the security cameras—I think that it should not be taken lightly: except the “tendering” of that kind… In Brazil, there is already talk of a “fines industry”, since the security cameras in the streets of São Paulo are used to catch “Formula 1 drivers”… but the money generated by these fines is causing mistrust among the most aware.
According to Canal de Moçambique, however, the government might have legal grounds for awarding the surveillance contract without a public competition, given that the country's procurement law treats certain national-security concerns as an exception.
But this still wouldn't justify the decision to award the contract to Guebuza’s son, given the possible conflict of interest.
Screen shot from "How the Cossacks Rescued Their Fiances" (1973).
Traditional' bondage in Mauritania; forced prostitution in Europe; and bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan.
In 2016, an estimated 45.8 million were subjected to some form of slavery in 167 countries, according to the Global Slavery Index.
Even though slavery continues to plague us, discussions about human trafficking or slavery are seldom part of mainstream public discourse, and rarely do these conversations cater to children.
But an episode from a classic Ukrainian cartoon series broke taboos around addressing human trafficking as early as 1973.
And now thanks to YouTube, almost half a century later, "How the Cossacks Rescued Their Fiancees" (Как казаки невест выручали), from the "How the Cossacks.." series, is making a global comeback.
Single episodes of the series, uploaded to the video streaming site, have received as many as a million views.
The episode on human trafficking has been viewed more than 500K times and intertwines folklore and social commentary in a way that can be used as a conversation starter about the broad area of kidnapping and slavery.
This episode is a little over 17 minutes long, but well worth your time, as the director Vladimir Dahno combined classic animation techniques with a hilarious storyline and an excellent musical score.
This episode follows three Cossacks who pursues a gang of girl-kidnapping pirates through various countries, which include satirically stereotyped depictions of Greece, Egypt and India.
The use of dialogue is minimal, making this episode accessible to worldwide audiences of all ages.

Jefferson Krua fled Liberia as a refugee at age 5, and eventually settled in Boston, MA.
Recently, he's moved back to Liberia to help with re-building the country's infrastructure.

This article by Heidi Shin originally appeared on PRI.org on July 12, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Mercy Krua and her son Jefferson are having a disagreement.
It’s about whether he should move back home.
We’re sitting on her living room couch in Boston, where she’s eager to show off his childhood photos.
This one’s from graduation, another one’s from the refugee camps in Ghana.
She’s reminded of what life was like before they fled Liberia, in the midst of its bloody civil wars.
Jefferson was just a small child then, and when he was hungry or tired, she couldn’t offer something as simple as a snack.
Tears would follow, and she would panic, for fear of being discovered: “So you need to make sure the kids don’t cry, to bring like, to raise awareness that people or civilians are in the area.
Cause they didn’t really care, they were killing everybody.
So it was difficult, terrible.”
But Jefferson remembers it differently.
He was just 5 years old when they left, and it all felt like an adventure.
Hiding in the back of a UN food truck to gain safe passage out of Liberia, escaping through the jungles of Côte d’Ivoire, before landing in the refugee camps of Ghana, where they spent seven years.
Jefferson says when they eventually arrived in the US, that’s when he remembers that life got hard.
It was the 1990s, and he was about to start middle school.
He takes me back to the housing projects in Boston where he spent most of his teen years.
He reminds me to lock the car door, and points to the street corner where he was jumped and his cousin was mugged, all while the school crossing guard looked on.
We hear the sounds of squeaking swings, and kids shouting in Cape Verdean and Creole, so they can be heard over the blaring of the police sirens and ambulances driving by.
When Jefferson was a kid here, he tells me, he was allowed to go from home to school to church, and that was it.
He kept his head in the books, and made it to college — to Cornell University, where he met other Africans, who weren’t refugees, but wealthy international students.
Here it was cool to be African.
The university housed a rare collection of journals, where he learned about Liberia from scholars.
He admits the irony of having come to America, to a remote place like Ithaca, New York, to learn about his family’s roots.
He learned to speak the language again, studied civil engineering, and set his sights on going back to Liberia.
He’d heard of other young Africans– who went to school abroad—and were returning to the Continent.
So Jefferson moved back to Liberia last summer, just after the Ebola crisis had ended.
He remembers what it was like, when first arriving.
“Man, I wanted to kiss the ground.
I was so excited,” he says.
“It’s like everybody talks like how you talk in your home, and it’s just a nice feeling to not be the other.”
Jefferson launched a digital news outlet in Liberia called the Bush Chicken.
Here is a photo he took while on assignment, covering a student protest against proposed tuition hikes at the University of Liberia.

He launched a digital news outlet called the Bush Chicken, which trains journalists to report with accuracy.
He’s also working on a start-up to bring a bike share program to Monrovia, where it can take hours for kids to get to school.
But his mother worries for Jefferson’s safety, and says all she can do is pray.
They no longer have family to look out for Jefferson in Liberia, and the fruit trees, where they ate mangos and avocados from daily — all of these were gone as well.
The land isn’t theirs anymore, and so for her, home has vanished, too.
For his mother Mercy, America is the place that’s provided opportunities.
In the refugee camps, there were no jobs to be had.
But here she worked long hours as a nanny, caring for someone else’s kids, so she would have enough to care for her own.
She saved enough to finish nursing school, and now works as a registered nurse.
“Honestly, I’m from Liberia,” she says.
“But wherever I am right now I consider it to be home.
Wherever you are, where you see that you can make a day-to-day living, I consider it home for me.”

She doesn’t want to talk about Liberia anymore — the memories make her sad, she says.
Instead, she proudly shows me a picture of US President Barack Obama and the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. hanging on her living room wall of the home she now owns.
But Jefferson tells me this story about a run-in he had with the police, just in front of his mother’s house in Boston, when visiting not too long ago.
“They’re questioning me, but one of them is so aggressive,” Jefferson says.
The policeman shouts at him, as Jefferson searches for his license: “Why are you taking so long? Don’t you know it’s cold out here?”
Jefferson admits, “And as a black male in America, I am just scared.”
He continues, “So with something like that, it’s really hard to call America home.
No matter how much money I can make in this country, whatever, I’m always going to be a black man in America.”
But in Liberia Jefferson is the 1 percent.
He shows me photos of the resorts he frequents, the press badge he flashes that gives him access.
He can even put on an American accent whenever he needs it — something that affords you respect in Liberia.
He dreams of becoming Minister of Transportation, and he’s chosen not to become a US citizen, so he can be poised to enter politics there.
“All my dreams, everything, all my goals in life they’re focused on Liberia,” says Jefferson.
He continues, “I have these nightmares where, I wake up and I’d just be sweating, and it’s basically Liberia got into another war again.
And that’s a fear for me, because I don’t know what I would do.”
But for now, he’s embraced the opportunities his new home has given him, and he’s committed to helping rebuild the country, so that he says, “things like war aren’t so likely to happen again.”

Chinese graduates at a job exhibition in 2007.
Photo from state news agency Xinhua.
Once again, more than 7 million students in China graduated from university in May.
If you add in the 300,000 overseas graduates and previous years' graduates who are still looking for jobs, that means more than 15 million young people were reportedly seeking their fortunes at the same time this year.
As a newly rising economy power, China is considered to have a huge job market.
Indeed, when you google “find a job in China”, millions of results pop up.
But the reality is many graduates struggle to find work after finishing their studies.
In fact, a popular saying that has arisen in recent years holds that "graduation equals unemployment."
In 2013, the unemployment rate of graduates from colleges and universities two months after graduating was 17.6 percent, according to Times Higher Education; for those in rural areas, it was 30.5 percent.
That's higher than the general unemployment rate (or at least what's thought to be the unemployment rate, since data out of China is unreliable).
As China's economy has slowed down in the past two years, the graduate unemployment problem only has worsened.
The frustration of China's younger generations is reflected in a number of widely circulated social media and mobile text messages, such as the following:
When we were born, the infant formula was toxic; when our bodies were in development, we could only consume junk food; when we attended kindergarten, the school fee was out of control; when we graduated from university, we were unemployed; when we tried to earn our living via the stock market, it collapsed; when we tried hard to fall in love, we found out all handsome guys were gay; when we started chasing after the mainstream , they were no longer mainstream.
What university means: management is like prison, the quality is for hooligans. learn how to kiss in public, consume like a white-collar worker, daydream in class.
Skipping classes is common, dormitories are like internet cafes.
Taking exams becomes a profession, only the aristocracy can afford school fees.
Thesis looks like Baidu search results.
Everyone gets short-sighted.
The food in school canteens is for feeding animals.
Having a job is like a dream.
Graduation equals unemployment.
Jobs on the market are for rural-to-urban migrants.
Many believe that part of the problem of unemployment for recent university graduates is related to the policy of higher education expansion since 1999.
Back then, only about 35 percent of high school graduates entered post-high school education including colleges, technical schools and universities.
But in 2015, the percent was more than 80 percent, and about 40 percent became undergraduates at universities.
For big cities like Beijing, the number of students entering university was more than 70 percent.
Some argue there aren't enough jobs for so many university-educated people.
On popular social media site Weibo, Lydia commented on the over-supply of graduates:
Graduates are everywhere, and college students are not worth anything now.
How could you tell the difference?
Another Weibo user, "Nomadic hero", wrote that a side effect of expansion is a drop in the quality of graduates in general:
The fight for educational justice to make sure the majority of people have the chance to go to school is good.
But it is true that the quality of students is getting worse.
It is the university, rather than students, that lose value.
"Ling Yan San Chi" lamented:
Graduated for two years already, but I am still working on how to find a job!! Why is my life so miserable?
"HaiDe XiaTian" even chose to carry on his studies in postgraduate school:
I feel regret , but there is no other way and I have to carry on down this path.
Going to postgraduate school will be my last chance to enter an ideal university.
The graduation ceremony is called commencement, which should stand for a new beginning for graduates, but many see it like an individual struggle, such as Weibo user UsedToBe5:
Finding a job is a tough thing because you have to fall down and get up again and again.
Of course, I have no one to blame since I choose it myself.
Not everyone is gloomy about the situation.
A hashtag on Weibo called #graduation doesn’t mean unemployment# gives the topic a positive twist, and messages try to offer support, tips and personal experiences.
The latest status with the above hashtag was published on July 12 by Weibo user "WanAn Xin XinYu," who was one of the 7 million newly graduated young people in 2016:
I am going to have another interview today, and I wish I could start working tomorrow. #graduation doesn’t mean unemployment# Add oil !
Although I have been unemployed for a month.
Photo posted on the Facebook page of Myanmar Meme by Htet Myat Lynn.
This is an example of memes reflecting the rivalry between the Yangon Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein (Kwee Phyo) and Wirathu, the leader of a radical Buddhist group.
Phyo Min Thei, the chief minister of Myanmar’s Yangon City, made a daring statement last week when he declared that the radical Buddhist nationalist group Ma-Ba-Tha (Association of Race and Religion Protection) is “no longer needed” since the Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee of the government is already overseeing the country's Buddhist affairs.
Wirathu, the influential leader of Ma-Ba-Tha, has threatened to hold a nationwide protest if the government will not take action against Phyo Min Thein.
But Internet users have launched a campaign in support of the minister.
Established in 2013, Ma-Ba-Tha is a civil-religious group composed of Buddhist monks and their supporters whose avowed aim is to protect Buddhism, Buddhists and Myanmar from the so-called “danger of Muslim expansion.”
Myanmar has a Buddhist majority population, although it has more than 100 ethnic minority groups.
Ma-Ba-Tha has gained notoriety because of its anti-Muslim statements and activities.
In particular, it has been a strong force behind the attacks against the Rohingya people, a Muslim ethnic group living in the western part of Myanmar.
Supporters of the ideology of Ma-Ba-Tha and its leaders have been producing a hate-speech narrative that demands the government to expel the Rohingya, whom they are accusing of being illegal immigrants and terrorists.
Many human rights groups consider the Rohingya to be one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.
Phyo Min Thein, known by his supporters as Kwee Phyo, is part of the new ruling party National League for Democracy (NLD), which is led by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
The NLD came to power in February 2016 after defeating the military-backed party during the general elections.
The military had ruled Myanmar from 1962 until early this year.
As Yangon’s chief minister, Phyo Min Thein has made a name for himself instituting several contentious reforms, like a building regulation he imposed during the annual water festival in April.
But he sparked an even bigger controversy last week by publicly speaking against the powerful Ma-Ba-Tha.
Fortunately, Phyo Min Thein received support from many Internet users. The hashtag #NoMaBaTha was endorsed on Facebook as part of the campaign to defend the chief minister against the online supporters of the radical Buddhist group.
Some Facebook users are adopting this image on their profile page in support of the chief minister:
Here are some reactions to the #‎NOMaBaTha‬ hashtag.
Htin Linn Aye distinguished the Ma-Ba-Tha from the rest of Buddhist monks in the country:
I revere the sons of Buddha who abide by his doctrine
but... #‎NOMaBaTha‬
Below is a Facebook post which went viral:
To those who are saying we will become dogs if Ma-Ba-Tha no longer exists, now let me ask have we always been dogs many years before Ma-Ba-Tha came? :p:p:p:p:p
credit ‪#‎NOMaBaTha‬
Moe Kaung San thinks Ma-Ba-Tha's actions are tainting the image of Buddhism:
Because the organization called Ma-Ba-Tha is
getting involved in politics and making the country unstable by
creating racial hatred and religious discrimination in the name of race and religion protection
and is putting a bad image of Buddhism
#nodesireforMaBaTha #‎NoMaBaTha‬
A Google form was also created to gather more support for the statement issued by the Yangon chief minister about the Ma-Ba-Tha.

A photo posted on Facebook by Presidential Press Secretary Don Wanyama showing Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni speaking on the phone by the roadside.
Twitter has exploded with funny memes after a photo appeared online showing Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni sitting on a chair by the roadside to make a call.
His motorcade, which was on the way to a public event, stopped for about 30 minutes for him to make the call.
Presidential Press Secretary Don Wanyama posted the photo on his Facebook page with the following message:
On the way from Isingiro District yesterday where he'd presided over the World Population Day celebrations, President Museveni stopped at Kyeirumba Village to make a phone call.
Curious residents gathered to look at the President, who after 30 minutes on phone, briefly interacted with them.
They thanked the government for tarmacking the road linking Uganda to Tanzania through Isingiro.
Some people wondered whether the photo was part of a plan to divert attention from the news of the release of main opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who was in jail for two months facing treason charges.
The hashtag #M7Challenge has been used to show images of Ugandans and other people around the world taking calls by the roadside.
President Museveni is nicknamed M7 because of the sound of his name.
Other Twitter users have been posting edited photos mocking the president.
It is not yet known who Museveni was speaking to or the subject of the conversation.
One Twitter user suggested that Museveni was speaking to leaders in South Sudan, where troubling violence has erupted:
#M7Challenge : It is possible M7 was having a "Let my people go" discussion with the leaders of #SouthSudan. — Frank Hook (@FrancisHookDF) July 13, 2016
Museveni has ordered the Ugandan army to evacuate Ugandans living in South Sudan following recent clashes in the capital, Juba.
Rosebell Kagumire warned #M7Challenge participants not to try this stunt:
Don't try this at home.
Fredrick Tumusiime shared an alleged advert for a local television station in Uganda:

It's extraordinary how much a place can change in 50 years. For example, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is one of the most populous megacities of the world, but you wouldn't believe it from looking at old photos of it.
In the 1960s, British photographer Roger Gwynn came to Bangladesh as a volunteer for the non-governmental Service Civil International.
He visited various parts of the country, which was then East Pakistan, and took photographs.
Recently, some of his photos of were republished on a Facebook page called Bangladesh Old Photo Archive and went viral among Bangladeshi users.
Launched on 24 August 2011, the page has more than 171,000 fans.
When you look at these archived photos, you get a glimpse of history, tradition and the lives of Bangladeshis over the past century.
The Roger Gwynn photos made many people nostalgic.
They reminisced on the good old times and a few expressed a desire to return to those days.

Communication expert Wazir Satter remembered an era of cheap food after seeing a street photo of the New Market area:
And one of the restaurants there used to serve special malai cha (Creamed Tea).
We the students of Dacca College used to visit this restaurant in 1967-69 for that cha and special gosht-porota (Meat Paratha), The name of the eatery was Chittagong Restaurant.
A cup of malai cha was 4 anas (25 Poishas).

But some how I remember all those moments.
I miss my father every second and praying for him.

Ranajay Gupta was nostalgic too when he saw the Hardeo glass factory:
Interesting.
Hardeo Glass Factory came up on land originally owned by my family at Tikatuli.
I believe there was a 'samadhimandir' (memorial shrine) for my great-grandparents Sarat Chandra Gupta (after whom Sarat Gupta Road is named) and Manorama Gupta at a corner of the land.
I am told the Rajdhani Supermarket later came up on the land; someone told me the samadhimandir still exists at a corner of the market.

Dhaka is known for its enormous traffic jams.
But in the 1960s it was a tidy town.

It was a memory hardly I could remember fr 1982-86, left that area in 1987 and after 15 yrs later once I visited there was very shocking.. 15 yrs changes were huge, landmarks turned into different shapes couldn't even believe there was a river we were playing, swimming.. even all the way hazaribugh to kamrangir chor went by car.. unbelievable...
Syed Rahman does not like the current cityscapes of Dhaka:
That's where I grew up and miss my childhood and feel like how good days were those.
Those were the golden days of my loving city of Dacca not Dhaka.

"If a student speaks Tetum, they get a $1 fine.”
Photo: Timor Post, July 13 edition
The board of the Fatumeta Basic School, in Dili, has decided to start enforcing a rule against students speaking any language but Portuguese, including Tetum, while on school grounds.
According to the newspaper Timor Post, the director of the school, Fernanda Belo, argues that students should only speak Portuguese.
Those "who do not speak the language,” she says, are better off “remaining silent.”
According to the newspaper, students caught speaking any language other than Portuguese are “fined.”
Written in Tetum, the Timor Post quotes Belo as saying:
We have communicated this rule to the parents and established that they cannot speak Tetum; everyone has to speak Portuguese.
If they speak Tetum, they get a $1 fine.
The school director emphasizes that the "parents agreed to the rule" and justifies imposing the fine in order to help students to speak more Portuguese.
After gaining independence from Indonesia in 2002, Timor-Leste adopted Portuguese and Tetum as the country's official languages.
A decade later, however, studies indicated that only 15 percent of the population spoke Portuguese:
Despite being part of the CPLP, Timor-Leste is one of the countries with lower penetration of the Portuguese language.
Throughout the country, about 20 different languages and dialects are spoken, in addition to Indonesian.
Only 15 percent of the population speaks Portuguese.
The Fatumeta Basic School's rules, however, appear to violate the country's laws on teaching.
The President of the Alola Foundation and the goodwill ambassador for Educational Affairs, Kirsty Sword Gusmao, told Global Voices that the school's policy of fining Tetum speakers is being reviewed:
I will refer this matter to Mrs. Deputy Minister for Basic Education because this rule/sanction does not correspond with the Law for Basic Education Curriculum .

Gusmão explained:
The Fatumeta School Director is the one that should be fined for violating Law-Decree 4/2015 of the Basic Education Curriculum, which requires (a) the learning process has to start orally, and then reading followed by writing; (b) the progression from Tetum to Portuguese (begins with the teaching of Tetum literacy) (article 11-2); (c) the hours of Tetum and Portuguese literacy in the first cycle is not equal (Tetum will be higher) and in the second cycle it will become equal; and (d) in order to end the learning of the literacy component, it will need to first establish the basis of the two official languages (article 11-2) (no need to teach other maternal or national languages).
Long live the Tetum language!
Global Voices also spoke to João Paulo Esperança, a Portuguese linguist who has lived in Dili for many years.
Esperança says the situation at the school needs to be confirmed, and then a response may or may not be necessary:
First, we must confirm the true situation at this school, but I personally do not agree with school policies that prohibit students from speaking the language they want to use on the school grounds, outside of class.
And there may also be families without financial means to pay these fines.
But I think it is not with an evil intent that some principals and teachers try to implement these measures.
Previously, schools in Timor often used corporal punishment, the teaching language was Portuguese (and, after the invasion, it was Indonesian), and students were punished physically for speaking other languages.
This was most people's personal experience, but modern pedagogy refuses such measures from the past, so some teachers try to use these fines as an alternative punishment.
As for the attempt to create an immersion school in Portuguese, it will probably have to do with the fact that schools, seen as model in Timor like the Portuguese School, the Reference Schools and the mythic Externato S. José are committed to everyone speaking Portuguese inside the classroom .
And this, lately, has led to a trend that should make us think.
Many parents of Dili's upper-middle class, whose children cannot gain admittance to these immersion schools in Portuguese, are putting them in Filipino immersion schools of English, instead.
Estanislau Saldanha, the president of the Permanent Council of the Board of Directors of DIT - Dili Institute of Technology, also believes the strict language policy is illegal:
This decision violates the RDTL Constitution in relation to the official language and also violates the basic law of education regarding the language of instruction at school.
Therefore, it violates the right that students have to express themselves and learn in an easier language that supports them to learn science materials in a faster way.
Virgilio da Silva Guterres, the president of Timor-Leste's Press Council, says the interests of teaching science should prevail:
The School of Fatumeta is meant to be a Portuguese language school?
The aim of the school is to teach science.
Using Portuguese or English language as a means or instrument to learn it, the goal is not the language itself .
We can not use children for retaliatory aims with rules that once applied.
The rules of the school Soibada, Maliana and College Ossu were valid and applicable in his time not for all time .
I ask the school principal to revoke this rule.
Kashogy Junior, whose younger brothers study in a primary school in Dili, wrote on Facebook:
Sometimes students are afraid to raise these questions because they fear being expelled from school.
They are afraid of being transferred to schools they don't want to attend, as well.
So concerns “go up in smoke,” though there are many stories.
Students think twice before they complain about anything.
Some students play ironic jokes with the situation when they are sanctioned.
The Timor Post's report has had a profound impact on Timorese society.
Fining students for speaking Tetum has produced particular shock among the public because Tetum is one of the country's official languages.
A public school in Uganda.
Tweeps argue that taxpayers money need to bail out schools like this one.
Image released under Creative Commons by The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance.
When news broke that the government of Uganda intends to use 1 trillion shillings (US$300 million) of taxpayer money to bail out defaulting businesses, Ugandans on Twitter called the move a 'scam" and suggested the bailout money go towards Uganda's neglected public schools instead.
The companies that the government wants to rescue accumulated debt from loans they privately acquired from various banks in Uganda.
Many of the businesses are run by powerful well-connected tycoons.
Some central bank and ministry of finance officials are against the bailout plan.
David Mpanga, a Ugandan lawyer, called the plan "socialisation of loss":
The privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss.
Must we all pay for business failure when we didn't all share in the profits made? — David F.K. Mpanga (@dfkm1970) July 22, 2016
Allan Ssenyonga was surprised to find out that one of the enlisted businesses is a discotheque:
Club Silk is one of the companies in need of a bail out.
Is this really a priority for Uganda?? #ScamBailOuts — Allan Ssenyonga (@ssojo81) July 22, 2016
Fredrick Tumusiime suggested:
For any #bailout, the public must acquire a stake in the firm(s).
No public money for private sins. #ScamBailOuts https://t.co/kQ95Ky2cqB — Fredrick Tumusiime (@tufre80) July 22, 2016
Ugandans questioned the rationale of plans to help well-connected and powerful tycoons in a country with little investment into infrastructure, and dilapidated schools and hospitals.
Sarah Bireete suggested that the government bail out poor schools:

With conflict and insecurity plaguing North and West Africa and civil war lingering in Syria, people continue to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea on makeshift boats to seek sanctuary in Europe.
The human cost of these passages has been dramatically high.
In 2015, more than one million people were estimated to have entered European Union countries by sea, five times more than the year before.
So far in 2016, the figure stands at more than 240,000.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, about 3,500 people who tried to immigrate to Europe died or went missing in the Mediterranean Sea in 2014.
In 2015, the number rose to 3,771.
This year has already seen 2,944 people perish.
This is where SOS Méditerranée comes in.
SOS Mediterranée is an organization aiming to provide assistance to any person in distress at sea, whether they are men, women or children, migrants or refugees, who find themselves in mortal danger while crossing the Mediterranean.
The project is financed by private donations and public funding.
The funds raised go toward renting the boat and the daily costs of maintenance and rescue.

The ship used for the operation is the Aquarius.
SOS Mediterranée was started by German merchant marine captain Klaus Vogel and Sophie Beau of France, who has experience in humanitarian programs.
The project was created after the end of the Italian navy's Operation Mare Nostrum, which also aimed to rescue migrants in distress at sea.
SOS Mediterranée's blog includes several accounts from those who have made the perilous journey.
These are a few of their stories.
Kebba is a 22-year-old welder from Gambia.
He fled his country because of the reigning dictator and lack of work:
The only way to get ahead is to become a soldier, and I didn't want to do that.
I lost my father and had to support my mother and my young sisters, so I went looking for work elsewhere.
In Libya, I was kidnapped.
I was held in a camp for two months.
There was virtually no food, no water, nowhere to sleep.
They killed six people I know in the camps.
They would say, "Give me your money or we'll kill you," and they kept their word.
I wanted to go back home, but I had no way of getting there.
So I decided to take a risk and go to Europe.
The smugglers kept us in another camp for two or three weeks.
When the day came, they stuffed us onto the rubber boat.
There was no captain, just the will of God.
I have two dreams: to become an underwater welder and to write a book about this journey.
But if life gives me nothing else, I hope to at least be able to live in peace.
Cyrill is a Cameroonian executive who fled the brutality of the militant group Boko Haram in the northern part of the country.
He spoke of torture houses, robberies and violence he witnessed in Libya, a launching point for many of the boats headed to Europe:
Libya is in another world—it is a country that has lost all sense of morality.
A world that has returned to an animalistic state.
There are kids who are trained to shoot at black people in the streets, rob them by putting a blade to their throat, or learn to torture migrants as their parents watch.
They talk about the systematic rape of women in the streets, the ruthless smugglers and guards who beat them and spit on them and tell them that they're not worth the bread they're giving them.
Gode Mosle is a 22-year-old Syrian who lived in Damascus.
He is now in Sweden but remains traumatized by his memories of his escape:
I told my friends in Syria to not take these boats.
They should go through Turkey and Greece, even though it costs a lot more.
There were about 700 of us in the boat but there wasn't even room for half of us.
Those smugglers are animals.
They scream at people, steal from them and hit them when they get on board.
It was a kind of psychological torture that started even before the boat.
Two Africans died in the hold.
They suffocated; they couldn't breathe because of the exhaust from the engine.
It was so rickety, we couldn't stand or move.
As soon as someone did, the boat threatened to capsize.
There was a lot of screaming.
I wouldn't make that voyage again.
I can't forget what I saw.
People are getting on those boats because they want to live.

A Nigerian citizen named his dog after the Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari.
Creative Commons photo by Erfan Kouchari in Tasnim News Agency.
A trader named Joe Fortemose Chinakwe has been arrested by the Nigerian police for naming his pet dog "Buhari," which happens to be the surname of the country's president, in a case that touches on Nigeria's long history of ethnic tensions.
The canine was named after a man called Alhaji Buhari, who is Chinakwe's neighbour.
However, a different neighbour reported him over the matter, and many have since misconstrued the name as coming from President Muhammadu Buhari (PMB).
The dog was named after a different Buhari.
Not Pmb.
Case has nothing to do with PMB https://t.co/TgoapGJ0vm — ZahrahMusa (@Zahrahmusa) August 21, 2016
Authorities said Chinakwe would be charged with "conduct likely to cause a breach of peace," according to the Vanguard newspaper in an August 17 report.
You know an average Northerner will feel bad over such a thing.
It can cause serious ethnic crisis or religious confrontation because when you are relegating such a name to a certain person, you are indirectly insulting him.
Nigeria is an ethnic fault-line state with over 250 ethnic groups and a history of violent tensions.
The three major ethnic groups are the Hausas and Fulani in the north, the Yorubas in the west and the Igbos in the east.
The country still bears the scars of years of distrust, bickering and pervasive cleavages that have been further exacerbated by religious fundamentalism.
The Nigerian Civil War, which lasted from 1967 to 1970, the numerous and unresolved root causes of ethno-religious crisis have dominated the country's socio-political space since independence in 1960 have not helped matters.
As though these were not enough, the perpetrators of these crimes targeting certain ethnicities go unpunished and a culture of impunity prevails.
According to media reports, Chinakwe had inscribed the name on both sides of the dog's body and walked the animal through his Hausa-dominated neighbourhood.
Hausas are a minority in the southwestern state of Ogun, where Chinakwe resides.
President Muhammadu Buhari, for his part, is ethnic Fulani.
Naturally, the news of Chinakwe's arrest and the reason given by the police did not go down well with Nigerians.
Abimbola Adedokun, a newspaper columnist, warned of the danger in allowing divisions along ethnic or religious lines to exist:
History has taught us that whenever the “average northerner” says he “feels bad over a thing”, the rest of us are supposed to hurriedly rearrange our manners.
We are told to take heed of invisible limits that “infidels” are not permitted to cross.
Alarmingly, a number of us have restricted ourselves to this emasculating avoidance of wrath.
We have mapped out “no-go areas” of public discussion that we trespass at grievous risks to ourselves.
We have seen the repercussions of trespassing these bounds and they are not pleasant.
From Gideon Akaluka’s killings to the Reinhard Bonnke crusade violence, the Miss World riots, the Danish cartoons saga, and many other instances of unwarranted violence that have occurred, we have long realised we are dealing with a short-tempered evil spirit who demands a sacrifice of our collective dignity so he can let us live.
Gideon Akaluka was a Christian Igbo trader in Nigeria who was beheaded by a mob in 1994 for allegedly desecrating the Koran.
A 1991 visit by German evangelist Christian Reinhard Bonnke sparked deadly riots in the northern city of Kano after he reportedly converted some Muslims to Christianity.
In 2002, more than 200 people were killed and dozens of churches attacked during three days of rioting in the north over Nigeria's hosting of the Miss World beauty pageant.
And in 2005, a Danish newspaper's publication of several editorial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad led to protests in various countries, including Nigeria.
Adedokun continued:
The trouble is that this evil spirit of violence who has a chokehold on our society is implacable.
He has tasted vats of blood of the innocent and assumed a proprietary right over our lives.
Violence in Nigeria happens, not because of intrepid and insensitive people who say things that make others feel bad.
Rather, they stem from a cultivated attitude of those who think others’ lives are theirs to take, and they have no regard for any law that attempts to restrain their execution of mindless violence.
There is no legal basis for a trial of Chinakwe, according to Monday Ubani, the incoming second national vice president of the Nigeria Bar Association:
In the eye of the law, it is not criminal for somebody to name his or her dog after another person.
It may be offensive by examining the circumstances under which the incident happened.
Nigerian Twitter users have condemned Chinakwe's incarceration.
Nigerian musician Seun Anikulapo Kuti, the son of the legendary Fela Kuti, said:
Wer all our human right lawyers dey, dis Na serious injustice, why govt no arrest obj wey name chimpanzee Patience? https://t.co/99nGwYonZA — Seun Anikulapo Kuti (@RealSeunKuti) 24 de agosto de 2016 Where are our human right lawyers?
This is serious injustice, why did the government not arrest OBJ who named his chimpanzee Patience?
OBJ stands for former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who once owned a pet chimpanzee named Patience, supposedly after Patience Jonathan, the wife of another former president, Goodluck Jonathan.
Obasanjo campaigned against Jonathan in Nigeria's 2015 presidential election, which current President Muhammadu Buhari won.
Reno Omokiri, new media spokesman of former President Jonathan, argued in a tweet that more should have heeded his words:
Remember when I said this? I was insulted and ridiculed but time has vindicated me. Expect more like this. pic.twitter.com/JGvjpwej7m — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 22, 2016
Omokiri was referring to his August 11 tweet: "If you want to know whether there is change in Nigeria, insult PMB the way you insulted GEJ and you will know the true meaning of 'change'!"
Buhari ran on a platform of "change" against Jonathan in last year's vote.
Twitter user MaziNze chided the police for double standards:
Fulani herdsmen not in jail those who killed for blasphemy roaming free
it is the buhari dog owner that is in jail
good morning Nigeria — maziNze™ (@hand2ome) August 24, 2016 The ethnic Fulani cattle herders have been accused of invading farming communities in Nigeria, leaving death on their trail. And in June, a woman was killed by a mob in Kano for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Mohammed.
A similar fate was visited on another lady in July, who was hacked to death in the nations capital, Abuja by suspected Muslim fanatics.
Kemi shared this photographs of Ali Baba, a Nigerian comedian, and his dogs which were named after world celebrities and leaders:
Meet Ali Baba &his dogs, OBJ, IBB, Obama, Abacha, Thatcher&Chaka
Those using ethnicity, religion and political sentiments to obfuscate this case should know that Nigeria is a country of laws.
The human rights community will never sit back and watch innocent citizens being traumatised and dehumanized.
The fact that the two persons who donated this money are from the North and the South West, respectively, shows that the bonds of brotherhood and egalitarianism among patriotic Nigerians are superior to the whimsical and repulsive commentaries of the ethnic and religious bigots.

The Bangladesh Daily Star reported on August 4, 2016 that Bangladesh's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission had ordered the country's International Internet Gateway operators to block access to 35 news websites.
No further details about the blocking have emerged thus far, but the list of sites is long and includes some that represent critical positions within the country's current political climate.
A full list of the domains ordered blocked, as reported by the Daily Star, appears below.

This comes on the heels of an Internet shutdown that took place early in the morning on August 2, when Internet access in a commercial area of Dhaka was cut off for 3.5 hours as part of a government-enforced “drill” to test the capabilities of telecommunications agencies in the country.
The national telecommunications agency indicated that it was part of a series of test shutdowns that will soon take place across the country.
The “Internet shutdown drill” was announced on August 1 and presented as a security measure.
This comes following the brutal attack in early July at the Holey Artisan Bakery, where 20 hostages were murdered as part of a terrorist attack that came at a time when violence is increasing in the country.
In addition to the Internet, other services were also cut.
Mobile phone operators reportedly tested their ability to shut down voice calls and ISPs were also asked to block certain web pages.
It is unclear whether these are the same sites that were ordered blocked on August 4.
The Chairman of the Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission (BTRC), Shahjahan Mahmood, clarified on August 3 that this exercise was the first in a series of temporary Internet shutdowns, saying “As part of the ongoing exercise, all sorts of Internet connections will be suspended for a short period anytime at any place in the country,”
Ahsan Habib Khan, vice-chairman of BTRC added that these future blackouts are likely to take place during the night, and on holidays.
Citizens are struggling to see how these shutdowns might have a positive impact on public safety, but the pitfalls of this strategy seem self-evident.
Bangladeshi citizens expressed dismay and anger on social media, with one Facebook user writing:
And wtf is this??
Without any prior notice or with such a short notice??
Do they have any idea how people work and how it may affect their work??
Imagine the situation - an area suddenly went offline around the most critical time and most of the people don't even know about it and you can't even use your cell phone data to communicate with someone to inform about the situation cause your entire area is f**ed up!
On Twitter, digital rights group Access Now called these actions “misguided”, as part of their global campaign against internet shutdowns, #KeepItOn.
BREAKING: Today Bangladesh announced an internet shutdown "drill".
Here's our take. #KeepitOn pic.twitter.com/0gVp1ndX8I — Access Now (@accessnow) August 1, 2016
This is not the first time networks have been deliberately shut down in Bangladesh.
In November 2015, the Bangladeshi government blocked social media sites including Facebook, Viber and Whatsapp for almost four weeks.
On the first day of that ban, Internet access was cut to the entire country for roughly 75 minutes.
Immediately afterwards, Mahmood said it had been a mistake and the shutdown was the result of a “misunderstanding.”
This new push to curtail citizens’ Internet access is extremely worrying, particularly in Bangladesh where freedom of expression is increasingly under threat, both online and in everyday life.
In 2011, the United Nations declared Internet access to be a fundamental human right.
Just four weeks ago, the United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday passed a nonbinding resolution condemning countries that prevent or disrupt access to the internet.
Despite these repeated violations of digital rights, the government’s claims of moving towards a "Digital Bangladesh" continue.
Protest in Ethiopia from Abdi Lemessa's Facebook page.
Used with permission.
As hundreds of protesters took to the streets over the weekend in Oromia and Amhara, two of Ethiopia’s largest administrative regions, security forces violently disbanded demonstrators with live bullets.
According to news sites and social media reports, about 100 protesters were killed.
The protests in Oromia and Amhara started at different times and for different reasons, but they both stem from identity politics.
The distribution of wealth and power among Ethiopia's 100 million citizens falls suspiciously along ethnic lines.
The Tigray make up 6% of the population but dominate the ranks of the military and government.
At 34%, the Oromos are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, but they have only a nominal federal representation in their country.
The Amhara represent 27% of the country's population.
Details of the exact number of fatalities were hard to come by before Monday because the government blocked internet services and telephone services in Oromia and parts of the Amhara region.
Funerals of the dead took place on Monday and Tuesday in Bahir Dar and numerous towns across Oromia.
Despite the government’s willingness to use lethal force, calls for more protests in Oromia and Amhara regions are already taking place on Facebook.
Activists, inside Ethiopia and abroad, claim that protests will not subside unless the government is open to an inclusive political solution in Oromia and Amhara.
A weekend of killing in Amhara and Oromia
The Amhara regional state capital, Bahir Dar, saw the heaviest causalities in decades on Saturday as the residents took to the streets in protest, defying authorities who killed at least 20 protesters in a nearby historical city of Gonder two weeks before. According to Amnesty International, at least 30 people were killed in one day in Bahir Dar.
Similarly, in Oromia at least 50 people were killed and hundreds were arrested.
In the capital, Addis Ababa, hundreds of protesters tried to gather at Meskel Square, but were quickly and violently dispersed by security forces.
On Tuesday afternoon a 1:40 second video posted on EthioTube shows security forces brutally beating demonstrators.

The Amhara protests
The protests in Amhara began on July 12, 2016 when security forces attempted to arrest a leader of the Wolqait Identity and Self-Determination Committee, Colonel Demeka Zewdu, on alleged terrorism charges.
The protestors in Amhara and their leaders are demanding the repositioning of the provinces of Welkait-Tegede community into the Amhara region from adjacent Tigray Regional State.
News reports and social media reports show that grievances among Welkait-Tegede community members have been building for some time over what activists say is the annexation of their land and forceful assimilation of their identity into Tigray region.
Remarkably, disproportionate political, economic and military power is vested in the elites hailing from Tigray region.
Pro-government commentators, however, play down the power of the Tigrayan elites instead blame opposition groups for blowing the question of Welkait-Tegede community assimilation out of proportion.
The Oromia protests
The demonstrations in Oromia are the continuation of protests that have become a daily occurrence since November 2015.
Initially, the protest started in Oromia when students asked the government to stop its plan to expand the capital city Addis Ababa into surrounding farm lands of Oromia.
The students argued that the controversial plan to expand Addis Ababa into Oromia state would result in mass evictions of farmers mostly from the Oromo ethnic group.
The government rejected the accusation, claiming that the expansion was intended only to facilitate the development of infrastructure such as transportation, utilities, and recreation centers.
Although the government has scrapped the plan to expand Addis Ababa, the move has fallen far short of the demands of the protesters, which include greater questions of self-rule, freedom and identity.
For example, the students are demanding that Oromo become a federal language.
Oromo, the language of the Oromo people, is the most widely spoken language in Ethiopia and the fourth largest African language.
However, it is not the working language of the federal government.
In May 2014, the government suspended the plan to expand the capital city in order to abate the students protests that saw at least 12 students were killed and hundreds of ethnic Oromo students were imprisoned.
But in November 2015, the government decided to resume plans to expand the capital.
It is not clear if the government will revive the plan again.
Demands of self-rule in other regions
The arrest of numerous prominent opposition leaders such as Bekele Gerba and Yonatan Tesfaye, the suppression of journalists and bloggers and the brutal crackdown on protesters by security forces, in which at least 500 people have died according to Human Rights Watch have served only to ignite fresh protests in Oromia.
The Ethiopian government spokesperson Getachew Reda frequently says there is no political solution as the government won the latest parliamentary election in May 2015 by 100%.
Observers say that this is the most serious challenge the Ethiopian government has faced since they came to power in 1991.
The closest was in 2005 when Ethiopia had its only truly contested election.
But lately questions of self-rule and identity have become one of the sources of political violence.
In April there were instances of violent demonstrations demanding self-rule in Southern Regional State, particularly in Konso area.
There were also similar conflicts in the South Western State of Gambela in January 2016.
Twitter user Awol echoed similar sentiments saying this is the most significant political mass action since the death of the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi:

Following the 2005 election the government gunned down at least three hundred demonstrators after the prime minister at the time, the late Meles Zenawi, declared a state of emergency when supporters of the opposition contested the results of the election.
Showing the level of defiance exhibited by the protestors, Ethiopian Press shared the photo below:

On Facebook, Balcha Mitiku advised protestors not to turn violent:
Please continue the civility you have shown thus far for not putting you hands on civilian properties or civilians.
A Facebook user using the name 'Fair Man' noted:
With this momentum removing the regime and working towards the new and fair Ethiopia is very near.
I urge activists to focus on constructively helping the ongoing struggle aiming at creating free and fair Ethiopia that we are going to have sooner.
Sanyiikoo Oromoo pointed out the peaceful nature of the protestors:
Oromo people are peace loving people.
We are not aggressors.
The people marched with religions books and green tree leaves to indicate that their rally is not designed for confrontation.
Yet they were savagely attacked.

Biblioburros, a mobile library in Colombia.

What would the world be without the wit and inventiveness of all those who see what goes on and wonder what can they do to improve it?
What would the world be without teachers?
Luis Soriano, a Colombian elementary school teacher born in Nueva Granada, understands the value of education.
He was raised in a community in the municipality of La Gloria, in the department of Cesar.
Soriano graduated with a diploma in Spanish literature, thanks to a professor who visited his village twice a month.
Personally aware of reading's importance, Soriano is doing what he can to make sure books reach children where they might not otherwise.
“Biblioburros” (literally “Donkey Library”) is a mobile library that distributes books around Northern Colombia on the back of two donkeys named Alfa and Beto, whose names together form the word alfabeto, or “alphabet” in Spanish.
And one more thing: they are the “wisest donkeys in the world,” according to blog Narrative Journalism in Latin America:
In 1997, had an idea that many considered wonderful, but for others was simply crazy: he decided on his own to load the back of two donkeys with 70 math, literature, geography, and history books.
His goal?
Take them to several poor children located in remote areas of his township.
Luis Soriano has enjoyed reading since childhood—a passion he says he owes to his aunt, with whom he discovered a memorable poem by the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío:
No doubt about it, Soriano is a Colombian Quixote who went crazy, just as the Knight of the Sad Figure, with books.
When his aunt read him "Margarita how sad the sea is," he couldn't sleep for eight days.
He was four years old and if he couldn't foresee it by then, at least he intuited his life would be intimately linked to literature.
Soriano recently spoke to CCN.com, listing some of the motivations for his Biblioburros project.
According to the website:
In regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools.
The children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school.
There are teachers that would like to teach in the countryside.
His wish to spread reading isn't limited to the Spanish language either: Soriano also shares his few English-language books with his young readers:
While crusading against illiteracy in a war-weary hinterland, Soriano is keen to expand his meager English-language book collection.
Understanding the importance of bilingualism in a country that increasingly is connected to the outside world through digital and print, he feels passionately that rural children should have greater access to words written in the world’s most widely-spoken language.
The video below shows Luis Soriano in action, highlighting the difficulties of obtaining books in some areas.
That, of course, is where he and his donkeys come in.
I have 3,480 books stored in boxes, stuck in shelves, in boxes, and in small boxes.
I also have them at my friends' places, otherwise there wouldn't be any space for me, or for the books.
Alfa is actually the one carrying all the library, we have 120 titles in these bookshelves for rural areas for children to enjoy.
We do tours of 3, 4, 5, even 11 hours.
That's 8 hours riding a donkey.
This is lifetime commitment—to feel useful to the society to which I belong.
In an article that appeared on the news website Quartz, Biblioburros was listed as one of eight libraries every book lover must visit.
Quartz sparked enthusiasm among English-speaking Twitter users, as well.

One day, the teacher Luis decides to load his two donkeys, Alfa and Beto, with books and takes them to remote areas for children who can't access them otherwise.
Since then, he's gone through the country with his mobile library.

Africans, like people elsewhere in the world, use Twitter in many ways.
Sometimes it's to have a laugh at themselves.
Sometimes it's to find common ground across countries and cultures.
Sometimes it's both.
For example, @IGtiz, a Kenyan student, has started the #100AfricanMyths hashtag to share myths that are passed on from generation to generation in African countries, mostly orally.
Myths in Africa serve different socio-cultural needs.
Parents, for instance, use myths to keep their young ones in check.
Here is a sample of some of the more hilarious African myths.
Faith Mulungi, a Ugandan radio presenter, tweeted:
When your palms itch,you will receive money#100AfricanMyths — Faith Liam Mulungi (@Omulungi_Hawt) September 27, 2016
@PatohShanqueels explained a common myth that went around schools where caning took place:
Do not cut your nails at night, according to @xolelwandengane in South Africa:
Flo Letoaba, a South African radio talk host, added this one to the mix:
#100AfricanMyths If you whistle at night, a snake will visit your room — The Usual Suspect (@Jude_Mugabi) September 27, 2016
Children were taught not to laugh at the disabled, according to @NaughtyMilz in Uganda:
If you laugh at a lame person you would give birth to a lame child.... #100Africanmyths — ռɨʟօtɨċ (@NaughtyMilz) September 27, 2016

49 year-old Slimane Bouhafs blogs in support of religious minorities in Algeria.
On 6 September, an appeal court in the eastern Algerian city of Setif confirmed the conviction of activist Slimane Bouhafs for insulting Islam and prophet Muhammad on Facebook, while decreasing his jail sentence from five to three years.
On 7 August, a primary court sentenced him to five years in jail and a fine of 100,000 Algerian dinars (approximately US $900) for “offending the Prophet” and “denigrating the creed and precepts of Islam” under article 144 bis 2 of Algeria’s Penal Code.
On appeal, the court of Appeals of Setif maintained his conviction, reduced his jail sentence to three years and dropped the fine.
Bouhafs, a Christian convert, and activist with the St. Augustine Coordination of Christians in Algeria which supports the rights of religious minorities in the country, regularly posts about the situation of Algeria's Christian minority on Facebook, his Google+ profile and personal blog.
According to Amnesty International, he is also a supporter of the Movement for Self-Determination of Kabylia (MAK), an autonomous political group seeking autonomy for the region of Kabylia.
He was arrested on 31 July, over Facebook posts he published between May and June 2016.
One of the posts reportedly cited as evidence against him was published on 21 June.
In the post, Bouhafs shared a cartoon by the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo showing Prophet Muhammad crying with the following comment:
Muhammad cries because he lost in advance in Kabylia, but also in all of Algeria.
His lie will disappear because the light of Christ is here, because he is peace, truth and the true path
The link to the Facebook post for which Bouhfsa reportedly went to jail currently shows no Charlie Hebdo cartoon.
However, the same post along with the cartoon still appears on his blog.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both slammed Bouhafs' arrest and conviction.
The Algerian League for Human Rights (which appointed its lawyers to defend Bouhafs' appeal) condemned the sentence for violating the Algerian constitution and international human rights standards, and called on the authorities to amend article 144 of the Penal Code which criminalizes insults to religion and state symbols.
Algerian authorities repeatedly use this article to silence those who criticize the state or religion.
Journalist Mohamed Tamalt is currently serving two years in jail for criticizing the country's president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in a poem he published on Facebook.
Iwacu front page (n°385, 29/07/2016) asking "Where is Jean?"
Burundian journalist Jean Bigirimana has been missing since 22 July 2016.
Multiple sources have told his employer, independent newspaper Iwacu, that he is in government custody.
Authorities are denying these claims.
Iwacu, which represents a small beacon in Burundi's notoriously difficult media environment, last week changed their website design to one that is entirely black and white, in homage to their missing colleague.
#Burundi yet another Black Monday.
Dark days, gloomy weeks, a sombre month for the family of the journalist Jean Bigirimana.
The country's once lively media landscape has suffered from the militarized response to third-term opposition, especially outside the capital Bujumbura.
Burundian and international journalists have faced accusations of anti-government bias or encouraging insurrection and been targeted with violence.
Iwacu director Antoine Kaburahe himself currently lives in exile in Belgium.
Before coming to Iwacu, Jean worked with Rema FM radio station.
Iwacu reports that in his travels to Rwanda, the 37-year-old reporter had written about the lives of exiled Burundian journalists living in the neighboring country.
Rwanda and Burundi have a long history of political and diplomatic tensions.
#Burundi moving images from the homage to the journalist Jean @iwacuinfo
Iwacu has vowed to continue searching for Jean.
Iwacu journalists undertook their own investigations which they published online, and hope to take the case to court, though this may prove difficult given the crisis and the many other uninvestigated deaths and disappearances.
Burundian rights organization APRODH recently reported that police and military sources, unhappy with the current situation, have identified 14 mass graves, likely containing some of the disappeared.
During their enquiries, two tortured bodies were found and eventually collected by police.
When Jean’s wife was brought to identify the bodies she said neither was him, although they were then reportedly buried without being identified.
Police spokesperson Pierre Nkurikiye confirmed that neither of the two was Jean:
#Burundi Investigation/ Case Jean BIGIRIMANA (journalist/IWACU): The 2 bodies identified : Not Jean.
Muramvya Prosecutor to follow up
The news raised concerns among citizens not only about Jean, but about other possibly undiscovered bodies.
Twitter user Thierry Uwamahoro asked:
Had #FindingJean team not embarked on that trek, we wld have never known about the 2 bodies.
So, how many more bodies r out there? #Burundi — Thierry Uwamahoro (@ThierryU) 10 août 2016
Eleven days after Jean's disappearance, Iwacu criticized the police for their “deafening silence” and for the apparent lack of an investigation.
Iwacu attempted to follow a lead of Abel Ahishakiye, someone Jean contacted by phone before disappearing, but he too then apparently disappeared.
In early August, colleagues of Jean's received a tip indicating that he had been secretly detained in Muramvya province.
Police spokesperson Pierre Nkurikiye denied that the journalist had been arrested, and on 5 August Burundi's independent human rights commission (Commission Nationale Indépendante des Droits de l'Homme) stated it found no evidence that Jean was in the custody of the SNR.
Other reporters have recently been similarly targeted. Oximity journalist Julien Barinzigo was arrested on 17 June and released on 05 August with restrictions.
Gisa Steve Irakoze of Radio Buja FM was arrested by SNR in early August, before being released on 25 August.
Some have not returned.
Rights activist Marie-Claudette Kwizera, with rights organization Ligue Iteka, has not been seen since December 2015 after reportedly being arrested by security agents.
APRODH’s president Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa is in exile after surviving an assassination attempt last year, and family members were then murdered.
The risks of attack even follow reporters into exile.
Boaz Ntaconayigize, a journalist with Bonesha, in exile in Kampala, was stabbed on 31 July.
He said that security agents had come from Bujumbura to infiltrate the refugee community and track journalists and activists.
Boaz was also later questioned by Ugandan police.
As many have disappeared or been found dead after being detained, officials' denial of Jean's detention has left his friends and colleagues fearful that authorities may be concealing information on his whereabouts or death.
On 25 August Iwacu’s editors published a “Letter to Jean” expressing their hopes of finding him and their fears of the worst.
Dear Jean we are so powerless against those who have made death their speciality.
(…)
Today we have only words.
But words are stronger than death.
Jean, they will not win!

The Russian Orthodox Church has another scandal on its hands, or rather on the wrist of one of its top clergyman in St. Petersburg, where the archdiocese recently published photographs taken on Metropolit Varsonofiya’s travels to Greece.
In one of the happy images, journalists spotted what appears to be a Rolex Daytona 116509 — a wristwatch that retails for roughly 2.5 million rubles ($40,000).
Varsonofiya went to Mt. Athos on Oct.
23, where he met with the new abbot at a monastery operating within the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church.
According to Varsonofiya’s own account, he congratulated the abbot on being selected to his new position, and gifted him a holy cross.
To mark the occasion, the church released several photographs of the meeting, including one picture revealing part of what appears to be Varsonofiya’s very expensive wristwatch.
Rolex introduced its Cosmograph Daytona series in 1963, designed specially to “meet the demands of professional racers.”
A watchmaker in St. Petersburg reportedly told the Fontanka news agency that a Rolex Daytona 116509 could likely be purchased on Russia’s black market for about 25,000 euros.
The press office for St. Petersburg’s archdiocese says Varsonofiya is still in Greece, telling reporters that clarification about his wristwatch will have to wait until he’s back in Russia.
There was a similar controversy four years ago, when Internet users noticed that the Russian Orthodox Church edited photos of Patriarch Kirill to conceal his $30,000 Breguet wristwatch.
Sadly for the church, its photo editors forgot to remove the watch’s reflection on a tabletop.
The church first denied the story, but later blamed an “inexperienced staff member.”

Outside Russia's clergy, Vladimir Putin's longtime official spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, landed in the center of a political scandal in August 2015, when anti-corruption activists spotted a $620,000 Richard Mille RM 52-01 wristwatch in his wedding day photos.
Peskov claimed the watch was a gift from his bride, and insisted that it was worth just $3,500, but this wasn't the first time he was pictured wearing the timepiece.
The story was one of the first and biggest revelations made by activist Alexey Navalny about the vast personal wealth of individuals in Vladimir Putin's inner circle.
Navalny has continued to publish similar investigations for the past year.

Hours ago, the third and final U.S. presidential debate ended, capping off a heated exchange between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that again mentioned Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, many times.
RuNet Echo recaps the debate-night tweets by one of Russia's biggest national news agencies to get an idea of what resonated in Moscow.
With nearly 3 million followers on Twitter, RIA Novosti was Russia's most active major news organization that offered live blogging during the third debate.
The following tweets appeared in chronological order.
The first tweet appeared about 30 minutes in, when Hillary Clinton first mentioned the U.S. government's spying allegations against the Russian state:
Clinton declares that Russia “spies” on Americans.
RIA's wording was likely meant to amuse Russian readers, whom the Kremlin has repeatedly reminded are at risk of being spied upon by the U.S. government, in keeping with revelations made by Edward Snowden and others.
Trump says why Clinton “doesn't like Putin.”
Putin wants to use Trump like a puppet in the U.S. presidency, Clinton believes.
Trump declares that the Clinton Foundation charity is a “criminal enterprise.”
Trump declares that Assad is much smarter than Clinton and Obama.
Trump promises to cancel Obama's healthcare reforms.
Overall, RIA chose to focus on Donald Trump's comments, whose alarmist tone is likely better for generating traffic on social media.
Naturally, the news agency also focused on moments when Russia came up in the debate, though nothing was tweeted regarding the extended conversation about the Russian-Syrian bombing of the Syrian city of Aleppo, which U.S. State Department officials have said should be investigated for war crimes.
In terms of retweets and "likes," the most popular of the tweets above was the one recalling Trump's declaration that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is “just much tougher and much smarter than and Obama.”
Into the Deep is a new Global Voices podcast that digs deep into one issue that isn’t getting the media coverage it deserves.
In this week's episode, we hear from Global Voices contributors Robert Valencia and Andrés Lombana-Bermudez as well as peace advocate Diego Osorio about why Colombians voted "No" in a referendum to confirm a peace agreement between Colombia's government and the militant group FARC that would have finally put an end to more than 50 years of war.

Jihad Diyab will need crutches for the rest of his life—a regular reminder of the torture he endured for 12 years, 8 months, and 7 days as an inmate in Guantanamo Bay, where the U.S. military operates a prison to detain suspected war criminals indefinitely and without trial.
Forty-three years old today, Diyab suffered permanent damage to his back while in the care of the U.S. government.
In an interview conducted earlier this year in Uruguay, he told an an Argentinian journalist that Guantanamo even haunts the prisoners who are lucky enough to leave.
The ones who make it out, he says, “are still U.S. prisoners inside.”
Diyab is one of the six Guantanamo prisoners (four Syrians, one Palestinian, and one Tunisian) who were freed and welcomed to Uruguay in December 2014, thanks to an agreement between U.S. President Barack Obama and Uruguayan President José “Pepe” Mujica.
Following a failed campaign to be reunited with his family, who fled from Syria to Turkey, Diyab declared a hunger strike in mid-August.
On September 15, he told the BBC that he blamed the governments of Uruguay and the United States for his situation.
My health is very precarious.
I’m sick, my energy is very low, and I personally hold accountable the U.S. and also the Uruguayan government, if I die.
In late September, after receiving a guarantee that his family was safe in Turkey, he resumed a liquid diet.
Diyab made headlines this June, when he fled Uruguay over the border into Brazil.
The Uruguayan media called him an “ungrateful” “rebel” for leaving the country that welcomed him out of U.S. captivity.
After a month of uncertainty about his whereabouts, Diyab turned up in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was detained for 17 days and then deported back to Montevideo. The circumstances of Diyab's deportation remain unclear.
Though officials have maintained that the former Guantanamo prisoners are now “free men,” the reality has been something different.
According to the newspaper Brecha, Uruguay apparently agreed to require that the freed prisoners remain in the country for two years before setting foot abroad, though top Uruguayan state officials initially denied that they accepted this condition.
Whatever deal Uruguay made with Washington, the fact remains that the prisoners released from Guantanamo have only been issued Uruguayan citizenship cards, which are not valid for foreign travel.
Today, public opinion on the former Guantanamo inmates has shifted, and even the former Uruguayan president who negotiated the prisoner release now says receiving the men was simply the price his country needed to pay in order to keep “selling oranges to the United States” and maintain good ties.
The Prisoners’ Protest
Five months after arriving in Uruguay, four of the "Six of Guantanamo" staged a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy in Montevideo.
Diyab was absent.
The men had gathered after learning that Washington refused to provide them with financial assistance.
Writing in a blog, the men say they were dumped in a foreign country without employment, their families, or local language fluency.
For this, and for the 13 years they spent locked up without charges, they deserve help from the government responsible, they argued in April:
They should provide us with the means to live as normal human beings.
They can’t just throw the mistakes on others, they should help us with houses and financial support.
We are not asking the impossible from them they detained us for 13 years and they should help form some years to come.
We think that this is the least they could do or we can ask for.
In a documentary about Jihad Diyab’s life in Uruguay, Anfibia magazine says the deal that secured his release was actually just an “informal” agreement with the United States.
In other words, there are no official documents establishing the former prisoners' rights.
The only formal sheet of paper applying to the prisoners is a letter signed by U.S. State Secretary John Kerry that lists the six prisoners' names and says “there is no information that were involved or conducted terrorist activities against the U.S. or its allies.”
Anfibia's documentary also examines the lives of other former Guantanamo prisoners who have settled in Europe and Africa, where many are facing similar problems.
One of these men, now living in Slovakia, told the magazine, “This is not freedom.
We are still detained.
I’ve left Guantanamo, but it's still in me—all the time.”
Another prisoner in the film called his life after prison “a second Guantanamo.”
Since April, all the former prisoners in Uruguay except Diyab signed a deal with the Ecumenical Service for Human Dignity (SEDHU in Spanish) to receive financial support.
Diyab refused to sign, saying he disagrees with the terms, which include housing and money for two years.
Diyab says his back injury prevents him from working, and argues that the financial aid offered isn't enough to sustain himself, let alone his family.
Diyab was the only of the six prisoners who entered Guantanamo with a wife and children.
Of the group, he alone says that he wants to leave Uruguay for an Arab country, where he hopes to settle with his family.
So, Where Now?
The next challenge Diyab faces is finding a new home.
In an interview with the independent journal La Diaria, Senator Lucía Topolansky—who imprisoned during Uruguay's dictatorship—promised that the government is searching for a solution:
What we have to do is search for a country that accepts him.
And this is not just Uruguay's problem or his problem—it's the world's problem.
In September, Uruguay’s government released a note confirming that it is looking for a country willing to receive Diyab and his family.
Officials say they are doing everything they can and ask Diyab to call off his hunger strike “to respect the principle of life.”
The negotiations, however, have made little progress.
According to WikiLeaks' Gitmo Files, Diyab—the son of a Syrian father and an Argentinian mother—earned his living as a truck driver for many years in Syria.
When he was arrested in Lahore by the Pakistani police in 2002, he was living in an apartment maintained by the Taliban and was selling honey to support his family.
The files link Diyab to al-Qaida members, identifying him as “high risk,” “high intelligence,” and “a threat to the United States.”
He was allegedly responsible for forging documents and passports for the terrorist organization.
Held in U.S. detention for well over a decade, he was never formally charged with any crimes.
Diyab denies all the accusations.
In the meantime, repeating what he did for 13 years in prison, Diyab waits.
In an interview with CNN, he declared:
I didn't want to go on hunger strike, but they have closed the doors on me and left me without any solution and this is the only path that I've found.
This week, after 54 days of hunger striking, Diyab was was diagnosed with a "superficial coma."
According to the newspaper La Diaria, he previously signed a document refusing medical intervention, "even if his life is in danger," but he later accepted intravenous feeding.
The doctor who is assisting Diyab says his current health is "critical" with a “high risk of sudden death.”
In addition to his deteriorating condition, his mediator with the Uruguayan government just left his case.
Nevertheless, the hunger strike continues as Diyab waits for a reply to his request.

Five Tanzanian citizens, Dennis Temu, Suleiman Nassoro, Shakira Makame, Juma Mtatuu, Dennis Mtegwa, appeared before a Tanzanian court September 14 charged with insulting President John Magufuli on social media.
The five denied the charges.
It is alleged that the five shared offensive content targeting the president and the police between August 24 and 30 this year, in violation of Section 118 (a) of the Electronic and Postal Communications Act No. 3 of 2010.
The section imposes a criminal penalty on any person who:
knowingly makes, creates, or solicits or initiates the transmission of any comment, request, suggestion or other communication which is obscene, indecent, false, menacing or offensive in character with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another person...
Of the five accused, state prosecutors allege that Mr. Mtegwa posted an abusive and offensive comment on a WhatsApp group called DSM 114U Movement in Kiswahili.
Roughly translated, the comment in question reads:
I don’t know what is going on in JPM’s head… He doesn’t even know how to say sorry.
We are at this stage because of one person who believes that what he thinks is always right…he needs to understand that politics isn’t about resentment and the Opposition isn’t an enemy…he should learn to compete with the Opposition on the basis of debate, not force.
In another recent case, Dr. Oscar Magava, a lecturer at the Mkwawa University College of Education in Iringa region, was arrested for allegedly insulting the president.
Regional Police Commander Dr. Julius Jengi Gava said on September 15 they received reports that the lecturer used social networks to the abuse the president.
He did not specify which social network he used and what exactly Magava said about the president.
Since President John Magufuli won the presidential election in October 2015, 14 people have already being arrested and charged for insulting the president on social media.
Thus far only one citizen, Isaac Abakuki Emily, has been found guilty of these charges.
He was convicted in June 2016 of insulting Tanzanian President John Magufuli on his Facebook page by the Arusha Resident Magistrate’s Court.
Tanzanian citizen Leonard Mulokozi was charged on June 22 under Tanzania's Electronic and Postal Communications Act over a WhatsApp message that authorities say is “abusive” to Tanzanias president, John Magufuli.
In October 2015, two Tanzanians became the first victims of the new law.
Benedict Angelo Ngonyani, a 24-year-old student at Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology, was charged for publishing materials which are “false or not verified by relevant authorities.”
It is alleged that he posted a Facebook post claiming that Tanzania's Chief of Defence Forces, General Davis Mwamunyange, had been hospitalized after eating poisoned food.
In November 2015, four Tanzanians — Leila Sinare, Godfrey Soka, Deo Soka and Monica Gaspary Soka — were charged under Section 16 of Cybercrime Act for publishing false, election-related information on WhatsApp.
Public prosecutors alleged that the accused published audio information on a WhatsApp group called the “Soka Group”, that was intended to mislead the public during the October 2015 Tanzanian general elections, which were plagued by accusations of vote-rigging.
Most of these citizens have been charged under the controversial relatively new Cybercrime Act.
Authorities frame the Cybercrime Act as an important tool for fighting child pornography, cyberbullying, online impersonation, racist and xenophobic content online, unsolicited messages (i.e. spam), illegal interception of communications, and publication of false information.
The controversial law was signed into law by the former President Jakaya Kikwete in May 2015, despite criticism from opposition politicians, social media practitioners, and human rights activists.

Residents of Khabarovsk in Russia’s Far East have been staying indoors or wearing masks when they go outside since a thick smog blanketed the city on Tuesday.
Russian officials are monitoring carbon monoxide levels, which have increased 1.5 times since the smog rolled in.
Smoke began to descend on Khabarovsk about two weeks ago and seemed to originate from the Chinese border province of Heilongjiang and the Jewish Autonomous Republic, a Russian region next to Khabarovsk.
Khabarovsk officials said that straw fires in Heilongjiang were responsible for the smoke, and sent a letter to the Heilongjiang Department of Environmental Protection asking that provincial authorities get the situation under control and take new measures to prevent future fires.
Authorities in Heilongjiang denied the Russian officials' claims, telling the Global Times today that farmers in the province had not yet begun to harvest crops or burn straw—and won't begin do so until early November because of recent precipitation.
Ас satellite imagery from "Fire Map,"(a Russian website that shows where forest fires are currently burning across the globe) shows, when the smoke began to envelop Khabarovsk two weeks ago, fires were indeed mainly in Heilongjiang and the Jewish Autonomous Republic:

By the time Heilongjiang officials responded today, however, the fires were almost all to the north and west of Khabarovsk:

On a state visit to Germany last week, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari made a sexist comment about his wife, First Lady Aisha Buhari, saying, "I don't know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room."
The comments were made at a news conference attended by both Buhari and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In a recent interview with the BBC, Aisha Buhari criticized her husband's leadership and his appointments, saying she might not support his re-election.
“The president does not know 45 out of 50 of the people he appointed and I don't know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years," she said.
“He is yet to tell me but I have decided as his wife, that if things continue like this up to 2019, I will not go out and campaign again and ask any woman to vote like I did before.
I will never do it again.”
Garba Shehu, the president's spokesman, later tried to calm the waters, saying President Buhari was merely joking:
My friends, can't a leader get a sense humour anymore?
Mr. President laughed before that statement was made. — Garba Shehu (@GarShehu) October 14, 2016
Many Nigerian Internet users remain skeptical, however.
Kola Tubosun, a linguist, was particularly unconvinced:
@GarShehu Hahahhaha-You're an idiot-hahahahaha. — Kọ́lá Túbọ̀sún (@baroka) October 14, 2016
Yomi said that the joke merely reinforced gender stereotypes:
Gender rights are still a huge issue in Nigeria.
The president's comments were dangerous and reinforce many terrible stereotypes.
What joke? — Yomi Kazeem (@TheYomiKazeem) October 15, 2016
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's name came up because of recent revelations about his own past sexist comments.
If you're bored of Trump, here's a CURRENT world leader who says his wife's place is in the kitchen #sexism #nigeria https://t.co/EDDos3bdni — Sophie Garratt (@SophGarratt) October 14, 2016
The online newspaper YNaija published an even more blistering commentary:
Beyond the hard bigotry of his comments lies something even more worrisome because it lies up there with the kind of unrestrained crassness as defined Donald Trump’s political philosophy of ‘grab ‘em by the pu__y’.
The president, in trying to silence, and ultimately humiliate his wife, said this: “belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room”.
While Nigerians, trying to cope with this tragedy by laughing rather than crying, have turned #TheOtherRoom into a trending hashtag, every adult of common sense knows exactly what room the Nigerian President was referring to, thinking he was sharing a ‘’locker-room’ joke: the bedroom.
We always suspected our president was un-evolved, unsophisticated, and probably unable to absorb both complex emotion and information.
But who would have thought that he was also, at the base of it – this man who positions himself as a paragon of virtue, introspection and personal discipline – crass?
Emeka said the comments are the views of the president and do not represent what all Nigerian men think:
Dear Angela Merkel, Buhari's view of his wife does not represent that of Nigerian men in anyway.
He is on his own. Thank you. — EMEKA (@EmekaEmezue) October 14, 2016
Other netizens disagreed, saying they consider Buhari's comments to be typical of most Nigerian men:
In this #Nigeria where old men marry 14-year-old girls and wives belong in the kitchen, wouldn't Trump win elections in a heart beat? — Femke van Zeijl (@femkevanzeijl) October 14, 2016
Femke's view was echoed by Amara Nwankpa:
Do not forget that there are many important people in this country who still believe a 14 year old girl belongs in #TheOtherRoom. — Amara Nwankpa (@Nwankpa_A) October 14, 2016
Recently, a traditional ruler in north-eastern Nigeria “married” a 14-year-old girl.
Rita expressed same sentiment about PMB (President Muhammadu Buhari):
Did PMB goof?
Yup Should one be vexing?
Not sure.
What guy did was put an amplifier & magnifying glass on the thoughts of many Nigerian men. — Rita C. Onwurah (@RitaOnwurah) October 15, 2016
Somi Ekhasomhi noted that the president should be held responsible for his comments, rather than using it as an excuse to chide others:
I'm seeing people that dont want to criticise Buhari.
Instead they are using him as point of contact for "all Nigerian men." — Somi (@SomiEkhasomhi) October 14, 2016
There were also jokes galore, of course:
Mrs Osibanjo: Yemi,Where do I belong?
PYO: Right here, by my side,darling. pic.twitter.com/5Rl7mJJxVX — S. (@smugdisguise) October 14, 2016
(PYO is Professor Yemi Osibanjo, the vice president of Nigeria.)
Another Twitter user referred to Atiku (Abubakar), a former Nigerian vice president:
Sam Hart said he regrets that the sexist comment will overshadow the real gains of the visit to Germany:
Sad thing is that this story will overshadow whatever he went there for. https://t.co/jUsZEAWM3n — Sam Hart (@hartng) October 14, 2016
President Buhari, meanwhile, has refused to apologize:
VIDEO | Buhari Doubles Down, Insists His Wife Aisha Belongs to the Kitchen pic.twitter.com/20kj7FGUdf — SIGNAL (@thesignalng) October 16, 2016
The newspaper YNaija calls the whole affair "truly frightening":
A journalist from Germany’s Deutsche Welle gave him an opening, and just in case we didn’t hear him clearly on Friday, Buhari responded by saying that the kitchen and living room are a woman’s responsibility even if she has a job – capping it off by saying Aisha Buhari’s responsibility is to look after him.
He did not attempt to play down his comments by calling them a poor attempt at humour, even though that is probably what his media team advised given the backlash.
He did not think he needed to.
Because he believes he, the wisest of them all, is right.
By confirming his initial remarks, Muhammadu Buhari has shown that he is exactly like America’s openly misogynistic presidential candidate, Donald Trump.
And that is truly frightening.

All mobile internet services have been shut down in Ethiopia for the last seven days, amid increasingly violent protest scenes and a recently declared a "state of emergency".
Demonstrations have taken place with regular frequency in Ethiopia's Oromia region since November 2015, with protesters demanding greater self-rule, freedom and respect for the ethnic identity of the Oromo people, who have experienced systematic marginalization and persecution over the last quarter century.
Authorities have used deadly force against the protesters on more than one occasion.
On October 2 alone, 52 people were killed.
The Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), an opposition party, has reported a death toll of nearly 600 people.
While select social media and messaging platforms such as WhatsApp have been shut down sporadically as protests have grown more intense, in Addis Ababa, the capital, this is the longest sustained mobile Internet service shutdown that has taken place since they began.
The sudden silence of the protests on social media has left those tracking the movement over Facebook and Twitter worried.
Mobile internet, social media cut for +7 days in the "African capital" #AddisAbaba.
The mobile Internet blackout is also likely resulting in a decrease in online news about the protests.
Activists fear that the protest movement, which has relied on social media both for coordination and for circulating their message to international audiences, will be severed from their primary means of communication.
Despite low Internet penetration in Ethiopia, social media are becoming essential —especially for the protest movements in Oromia and Amhara regional states.
Newsfeeds from Facebook pages and Twitter feeds from Ethiopia are not showing the same abundance of posts as they were a week ago.

With a state of emergency now in place, expect more #Internetshutdowns and #surveillance. #KeepItOn pic.twitter.com/pD2laTPzpF — Moses Karanja (@Mose_Karanja) October 9, 2016
The government has been cutting off connectivity and blocking social media in Oromia and Amhara regions over the past 12 months.
In June they blocked social media in the name of preventing exams leaks, but now it is not clear whether te government is switching off all mobile internet services as a precursor to the ongoing protest, or if the measure is intended as a reaction to protests.
Those close to the situation fear this may be the beginning of a dangerous new phase after 12 months of protests.

This post originally appeared on Groundviews, an award-winning citizen journalism website in Sri Lanka.
An edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Sri Lanka recently announced that it will pay as much as USD 170 million (Rs. 25 billion) to the aircraft-leasing company AerCap Holdings, in order to cancel the purchase of four Airbus A350 aircraft, which the country's Rajapaksa government had previously purchased in 2013.
As part of what officials are calling a restructuring plan, Sri Lanka simultaneously decided to discontinue the budget airline Mihin Lanka.
SriLankan Airlines has languished in debt for years.
The last time the company earned a profit was reportedly in 2009, one year after Emirates sold its stake in the national carrier.
Most recently, it reported a net loss of Rs.
16.33 billion rupees (USD 112 million) for the year.
Groundviews has created an infographic to show what the government could have funded with the money spent on canceling the purchase of the four aircraft.
The figures are drawn from the Finance Ministry's 2015 annual report.
Infographic by Groundviews.
1 LKR = 0.00683338 USD
Rs. 25 billion is a significant sum of money, and the announcement was met with a similar level of anger on social media:
#lka #FlyingFolly @flysrilankan cancels four A350 aircraft, incurs USD98m (LKR 14b) penalty.
As the infographic shows, the money used to cancel the order for the Airbuses could have been used to pay for pensions, Samurdhi payments (social welfare), medicine, or school supplies.
SriLankan Airlines has struggled with debt for years (auditors flagged its viability as far back as 2009), and yet the government continued to purchase aircraft, compounding the losses incurred.
Now, Sri Lanka will have to pay the price — to the tune of millions of dollars.
The end of LinkedIn in Russia?
LinkedIn, the world’s largest online professional network, is at risk of being blocked in Russia, where federal censors have convinced a Moscow court to outlaw the network.
A judge found that LinkedIn illegally shares non-users’ personal data without their permission.
In what could have even more far-reaching consequences, the Moscow court also ruled that LinkedIn collects personal information from users in Russia without storing the data on servers located in Russia — a legal requirement introduced last year that few foreign Internet companies respect.
According to the newspaper Kommersant, federal censors decided to move against LinkedIn following repeated leaks of user data.
Earlier this year, it was revealed that the company lost 167 million account credentials in a data breach in 2012 — far more than the 6.5 million accounts originally thought.
Federal censors say they turned to the courts because LinkedIn has no official representation in Russia.
The network has roughly 5 million registered users in Russia (about half of them are believed to be active) and 400 million users worldwide.
In their lawsuit, Russian censors reportedly argued that LinkedIn collects and transfers data belonging to Russian citizens, including Russians who are not members of the website, violating multiple privacy laws.
The court ruled in favor of the government on August 4, ordering police to take steps to restrict access to LinkedIn across the country.
At the time of this writing, LinkedIn remains accessible to most Internet users in Russia.
Based in Arusha, Tanzania, the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights is a continental court established by African countries to ensure the protection of rights in Africa.
The Court complements the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.
While the African Commission only gives recommendations, the Court's decisions are binding.
The Court was established under the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights.
According to the video, as of September 2016, only 30 countries have ratified the protocol.
The video points out that the Court has already made two major decisions relating to freedom of expression in Africa.
In 2014, the Court ruled that imprisonment for defamation violates the right to freedom of expression.
In the same year, the Court ordered a reopening of the investigation into the killing of Burkinabe investigative journalist and publisher Norbert Zongo.

"Valley of a Thousand Hills" is a recent mini documentary about Indigo Skate Camp, an effort to create the first generation of Zulu skaters in the village of Isithumba, in the Kwazulu-Natal region of South Africa.
The village is surrounded by 1,000 hills, hence the title of the film.
The camp is the brainchild of South African professional skater Dallas Oberholzer.
Skateboarding is not a common sport in South Africa, especially among blacks.
In addition to skateboarding, the 30 to 40 kids taking part in the programme are taught self-respect, health and safety, art and music.
The film is by Jess Colquhoun, a documentary filmmaker and photographer, and Huck Magazine.

Fear of Justice?
Decolonisation?
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh who has been in power since 1994 is widely accused of human rights violations.
Public domain photo by the White House uploaded online by Wikipedia user Alifazal.
Following an announcement to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Gambians have dismissed the government's reasoning.
Activists and ordinary people both at home and abroad are discussing what they perceive as the "real" reasons the government decision to withdraw the country from the ICC.
The government has accused the world body of unfairly targeting African leaders while ignoring leaders of the Western world.
While announcing the withdrawal, Gambia's Minister of Information Sheriff Bojang said that the ICC is "an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans."
The announcement follows moves by South Africa and Burundi to quit the court.
Since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has opened inquiries involving nine nations - all except one involve African nations.
Early this year, members of the African Union backed a Kenyan proposal to push for withdrawal from the court.
Independent presidential candidate Dr. Isatou Touray in a press release condemned the Gambian government's wish to withdraw and said it reflected current President Yahya Jammeh's rule:
Fellow Gambians the removal of the Gambia from the ICC, just like the withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 2013 is an unconstitutional act that reflects once more President Jammeh’s disregard for the constitution and the laws of the Gambia.
Dr. Touray, a human rights activist, is the first Gambian woman to launch a bid for the presidency.
Presidential elections will be held in the Gambia on 1 December 2016.
In October 2013, the country left the Commonwealth, calling it an "extension of colonialism".
But for Mama Linguere Sarr, a Gambian journalist and activist based based in Sweden, the government is withdrawing from the ICC for fear of justice.
In September 2016, President Jammeh removed his interior minister and longtime friend Ousman Sonko.
Shortly after his dismissal, Ousman Sonko, who has been named in extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, sought asylum in Sweden.
Breaking!! #Gambia withdraws from ICC.
This follows the dictator's fear that his ex Interior Minister will incriminate him to gain asylum
— MamaLinguere Sarr (@mamasarr) October 25, 2016
However, some people agree with the government's desire to withdraw from the ICC, hailing it as part of a decolonisation project.
Benjamin Mpofu wrote on Facebook:
The act of continental defiance against a court system created to perpetuate a racist justice system is critical and the timing of it all reminds me of the 50s and 60s when former colonies raged against the machine thanks to the weakening of the colonisers due to the world war.
The current redesigning of the worlds geopolitics presents the perfect time for Africa to advocate for its own interests.
The project of decolonisation in its totality must begin and leaving the ICC creates that very precedent.
But for lawyer Malick Jallow, the decisions of African countries to quit the ICC is based on the wrong premise.
He wrote:
I have followed the debate on the recent declarations regarding withdrawal by a few African Countries from the ICC, including The Gambia.
A lot of it confirms my long held notion that the ICC and International criminal justice is perhaps the most misunderstood concept in Africa.
The ICC chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, who is Gambian, has since responded to the departure of African states to leave the ICC.
"We must remain strong," Bensouda told reporters in the Hague last week.
Bensouda previously served in President Jammeh's government, appointed as minister of justice in 1998, serving as the chief advisor of government on legal matters.
But she was sacked two years later.
The Gambia is yet to submit divorce papers to formally begin the withdrawal, but analysts are optimistic that there is no turning point for the tiny West African state.
Over the years, the country has increasingly shifted its focus from the West to the East.
In 2016, it opened an embassy in Russia and resumed diplomatic ties with mainland China (both countries are not members of the ICC).
Who will win on November 8: Trump, Hillary or Stein?
Even though many Global Voices contributors cannot vote in the US, we all feel invested in this American presidential race like few elections ever before.
The questions that come to our mind: Will the US become more interventionist or isolationist?
Could a woman president in the US change things for women around the world?
Will it be harder for immigrants and minority groups to live in the United States?
To express our angst and get our thoughts out, every Wednesday, from October 26 to November 9, four Global Voices contributors will get together and talk about the latest news coming out of the US elections, what people outside the US think, and how our American contributors—who travel around the world and are familiar with political processes in other countries— feel about this election.
Conversation #2: Tuesday, November 2
With just six days to go until this roller coaster of an election campaign is over, everyone's nerves are thoroughly frayed.
To discussed our frazzled reactions to the campaign, this second episode of this three-part series is a fun, fast-paced conversation between: Marianna Breytman, New York-based US voter and Lingua Community Coordinator Georgia Popplewell, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago-based Global Voices Managing Director Sana Saleem, San Francisco-based Global Voices Pakistan Editor
This conversation was moderated by Nevin Thompson, Global Voices social media editor and Japan editor.
Last week, our Beirut-based social media editor Zuhour Mahmoud moderated a discussion that included our Middle East and North Africa editor Joey Ayoub, Amsterdam-based US voter and Iran contributor Tori Egherman, and Sahar Ghazi, San Francisco-based US voter and Global Voices managing editor.

Zone9 members rejoice at the release of Befeqadu Hailu (second from left, in scarf) in October 2015.
Photo shared on Twitter by Zelalem Kibret.
Befeqadu Hailu, one of the best-known voices in Ethiopia’s stifled media environment, was arrested on November 10, 2016.
In the morning hours, authorities took Befeqadu from his home to a jail cell in a nearby police station.
He spent the day in there and was then transferred to a police station located in a neighborhood called Kotebe.
A member of the high-profile Zone9 blogger collective and a Global Voices contributor, Befeqadu is an active voice in the blogosphere and on Twitter.
When the Ethiopian government declared a state of emergency, he wrote:
Now, the government in Ethiopia has declared a ‘state of emergency’ that lasts in six months.
As ‘the usual suspects’ because of our dissents , my friends and I are scared more than before.
It has always been a risky thing to criticize the government here.
Furthermore, this declaration has given the government the right to arrest us even without an excuse.
I’m publishing this personal note as a blog because I am afraid I may be arrested sometime soon.
If so I want people read me and understand me.
I want people to also understand my likes to understand the desperate protests in Ethiopia.
It’s an attempt to survive as human with dignity.
Authorities did not officially disclose the reason for Befeqadu's arrest, but they told him that he was wanted by the highest-ranking military officer (also known as command post) that is instituted by the state of emergency. Later he was told that the interview he gave for Voice of America's Amharic Service about Ethiopia's state of emergency was the reason for his arrest, and that he either will be charged or given "educational" training.
His friend and co-author Zelalem Kibret shared on Twitter the five-minute sound bite from Voice of America that supposedly justified Befeqadu's arrest. The clip is in Amharic.
In October, the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), an opposition party, reported a death toll of nearly 600 people.
Along with his Zone9 blogging collective colleagues, the 35-year-old has been arrested and stood trial several times.
From April 2014 until October 2015, they were jailed and then charged under Ethiopia's Anti-Terrorism Act. In April of 2016, the prosecution appealed the decision against five of the Zone9 bloggers, including Befeqadu.
Befeqadu unfortunately is in good company as a writer under fire in Ethiopia. Natnael Feleke, also a member of the collective, spent three days in October in a local police station after he was arrested for conversing loudly with his colleagues in a hotel about the causes of stampede that resulted in deaths of hundreds of people in late September.
Seyoum Teshome, a prominent blogger who was arrested last September is not yet known.
Almost two months after his arrest, authorities have not disclosed the causes of his arrest or any charges against him.
The Global Voices community stands in solidarity with Befeqadu.
We urge his immediate release by Ethiopian authorities.

Ninety per cent of the action will be online, where emerging and professional digital influencers will be profiled and interviewed.
The week-long event will also organize blogger meetups hosted by bloggers of Caribbean descent.
Odessa Chambers, owner of the lifestyle and entertainment blog oaccessjamaica.com will host the meetup in Kingston, Jamaica.
Port of Spain's Mel Gabriel, who is a writer, editor and owner of CaribbeanLookBook.com, will be the Trinidadian host.
The New York meetup will be hosted by Mikelah Rose, founder of StyleandVibes.com.
In London, the meetup host will be Ursula Barzey, founder of the Caribbean travel and luxury blog CaribbeanandCo.com.
The CBW might just be the ideal opportunity for Caribbean writers and commentators to step out of the shadows of their Facebook threads, hashtags and retweets, and start making a greater impact in the global online dialogue.
‘Why Can’t I Kiss My Girlfriend in Public?’
Photo: Anna Nikoghosyan for OC Media.
All photos used with permission.
The following is a version of a partner post written by Anna Nikoghosyan that first appeared on the website OC Media.
I was 19-years-old when I met a lesbian girl who liked me.
I told her I was not one of “them”, but suddenly, for no reason, I kissed her.
It was with her that I first realised what love is.
Eva (not her real name), 24, is a queer woman living in Yerevan.
She went through many stages while discovering her sexuality.
At first, it was classical self-identification as a heterosexual woman, which then transformed into a bisexual identity.
Having realised her affection towards transgender individuals, she then thought that she was pansexual.
Now she does not want to associate herself with a distinct sexual category or search for a label for her sexuality.
"I am just a person who loves another person; I am queer," she says.
Parandzem and Taguhi.
Photo: Anna Nikoghosyan for OC Media
On the façade of an old building in downtown Yerevan, there is some graffiti that reads, ‘Parandzem and Taguhi were having sex the whole night’.
This spot of graffiti feminising the male-centric public space of the city is actually a defiant take on well-known advertising slogan from bygone times: 'Parandzem and Taguhi were cooking pasta the whole night'.
"This really influences people," Eva says, without specifying who daubed the graffiti.
Queer people are one of the most marginalised and discriminated groups in Armenia.
A 2016 research paper entitled ‘Hate Crimes and other Hate-Motivated Incidents against LGBT People in Armenia’ found that of 200 queer people interviewed for the study, 198 had been the victim of or witness to hate crimes or other hate motivated incidents.
Recognising the need to stop violence and prejudice against queer people, more and more activists and human rights defenders in Armenia have started to push for the protection of queer rights, for equality, and to end discrimination.
However, within the queer rights discourse, the voices of lesbian, bisexual, and trans women remain marginal.
"As in generally all women’s experiences, LBT women’s stories remain invisible," Eva says.
According to her, in a society where all women face barriers speaking about their issues, it is even more difficult for women with a non-heteronormative sexuality to speak out.
"We do everything in secret"
Queer women in Armenia thus face a multi-layered oppression that targets their gender and sexual self-expression simultaneously.
Since there are a lack of opportunities to freely expose their problems, queer women are psychologically vulnerable and are often unable to share their emotions with the outside world.
These pressures sometimes manifests themselves in depression or panic attacks.
"We do everything in secret.
There are small communities where I can feel safe, but at home, among other friends and relatives, I can’t be who I am," says Eva.
Isolation and emotional problems are only one example of the challenges faced by queer women in Armenia.
Eva says that if a queer person's sexuality is revealed, that person can sometimes be subjected to “corrective rape” as heterosexual men look to assert their definition of what is 'normal' on the victim.
The police won’t help
The security risks faced by queer women are still very real in the country.
Eva tells of how often, after leaving a pub or a café, or simply while walking down the street with her girlfriend, that she is followed by men.
"I get really scared because I don’t know what could happen to me.
The guy is in a car, physically stronger than I am.
He can do whatever he wants and nobody will care."
Eva does not believe that the police would help her because even if she goes to them to seek protection, the police will laugh at her sexuality and ask questions that make her feel uncomfortable.
That has happened to her lesbian friends many times, she says.
Once, Eva and her transgender friend were attacked in a park by men, who started to beat and curse them.
Other men in the area, instead of trying to stop the perpetrators, approached and demanded they stop cursing as there were other women in the park.
"So it was totally fine that they were beating us, but they had to do it in silence, exactly the way they beat women in their homes," says Eva.
‘You need to try it with a man to know what real sex is’
While there is widespread violence and aggression against queer women, lesbian relationships are also not considered to be serious.
Statements such as, ‘she is a lesbian because she hasn’t met a real guy yet’ and ‘you need to try it with a man to know what 'real sex' is’ are commonplace.
Lesbian women are often objectified by men.
For many, a lesbian is a sexy woman from a porn movie who is there to serve as an object for men’s gazes, and to fulfil a heterosexual man’s craving.
"There were many times when they approached me and my girlfriend to suggest that we have sex with them.
When we would refuse, they would ask if we could at least have sex in front of them," Eva says.
Family pressures
The pressure felt by queer women in Armenia does not come only from the outside world.
According to research carried out by Pink Armenia and Socioscope, queer people are very often subjected to different types of violence by their family members, in an attempt to change their ‘incorrect’ sexual orientation or gender identity.
Eva’s parents do not know about her sexuality.
However, according to her, she feels lucky, because there is no hatred in her family against any group.
"Many of my LGBT friends come to our apartment.
Even my trans friends come.
We all drink coffee with my mum.
She’s really chill with them."
Once, Eva’s mother asked her if she was a lesbian.
Eva was not ready to come out to her mother, so she lied to her.
She regretted this afterwards, since coming out became much harder.
Notwithstanding the relative tolerance of her family, Eva still experiences some psychological pressure from her relatives.
To her grandmother, Eva is already an ‘old maid’.
Once, when Eva’s mother asked her why she does not get married, Eva asked her in return why she does not do the same.
"I said, 'I don’t ask you to have a baby so that I have a sister, do I? Then why do you tell me you want a grandchild and a son-in-law?'
After this, they never had any conversations like that again."
What is wrong with kissing a beloved in public?
On other occasions, Eva is not afraid to talk freely about her sexual orientation, however.
Once, some of her old friends were talking about queer people with hate speech, saying that they needed to be burned or killed.
Eva said her remarks made her friends rethink their abusive behaviour and ignorance.
For Eva’s partner, who comes from abroad, the way people look at her and her girlfriend when they walk together is very strange.
Every time they’re at a bus station, Eva’s girlfriend comes closer to kiss her before entering the bus.
But Eva feels compelled to resist, at the same time wondering what is wrong about kissing her beloved in public.
Eva believes that she would never face such challenges were she in a heterosexual relationship.
She recalls her earlier years of adulthood, when she was with a young man.
"We could walk freely, hold hands, nobody would pay attention".
However, in a same-sex relationship, she says, life becomes full of fear and lies; a double life where everything requires overthinking.
‘I am in love, and I want to be able to talk about this’
"I don’t know why I need to lie to my mother. I have a person whom I love, I have tender feelings towards her, what could be better than this?
I am in love, and I want to be able to talk about this with others.
We live a happy life together, we walk, we go to cafés, we dance, we smoke.
Isn’t this beautiful?
People should be happy for us, shouldn’t they?
But no, nobody’s happy; people just want to kill us," Eva says, her voice beginning to tremble.
Eva often thinks about moving.
Locally conducted research shows that in 2011–2013 alone, almost 6,000 Armenian citizens left the country due to some form of discrimination.
A non-accepting society can take a tremendous toll on a person's mental health .
Even seeking consultations from a psychologist is an issue, as psychologists who are queer-friendly and are aware of queer people’s specific challenges are the exception.
"I now have a real struggle inside myself.
Should I stay here and try to change our society, or, as I only have one life, should I go to a safer place and have a happier future?"
Homophobia: a political tool in a country at war

Eva believes that homophobia has recently become trendy in Armenia, a heavily militarised country that lives in constant fear of full blown war with neighbouring Azerbaijan.
Even those who do not necessarily have a problem with queer people express hateful, homophobic attitudes just because it is popular to do so.
Moreover, queer people quite often become a target in political games.
Whenever domestic politics in the economically depressed country threatens to boil over, articles on queer topics suddenly become widespread, and people shift their attention from the controversies of government to the ‘preservation of Armenian values and traditions’.
Among possible examples of this are the arson attack on a queer friendly pub two days after the disputed parliamentary elections in 2012, and the ‘anti-gender’ movement in 2013, that emerged as Armenia was choosing between an Association Agreement with the EU and joining the Russian led Eurasian Economic Union.
Queer people in Armenia are thus politically constructed by the media as ‘enemies’.
Queer women are particularly targeted.
Eva thinks that in small states on a war footing, like Armenia, where people's lives are absorbed by the struggle for survival, women’s rights and queer rights are not a priority.
"If nobody has died today, everything is good," Eva says.
"Therefore, as long as Armenia is in a military conflict and is one of the most militarised countries in the world, there is little hope that anything will change for us," she surmises, lighting the last cigarette in her pack.

Following intense campaigning from candidates Guillermo Lasso and Lenin Moreno, it was the latter who was declared the winner of the presidential run-off election in Ecuador on April 2.
However, the opposition and Lasso's supporters are alleging fraud and calling for protests to demand a new count.
The official numbers given by the National Election Council was 51.16% for Moreno and 48.84% for Lasso.
The days following the vote have seen a massive wave of demonstrations, documented under the hashtags #Megafraude (Mega-fraud) and #LicenciadoMoreno ("Graduate" Moreno, a common name used for someone who has a degree) to underline the fact that some people refuse to call him "president-elect":
Some Ecuadorians citizens have gone to the streets to make their voices and their protests heard
The campaigns exposed a strong division amongst voters, between those who essentially view ruling party candidate Lenin Moreno as continuing the socialist-inspired agenda that until recently was lead by President Rafael Correa, and those who view CREO party candidate Guillermo Lasso as representing strategic change more in line with conservative economic ideals.
Lisette Arévalo Gross and Sol Borja, analysts from Ecuadorean media outlet GkillCity, described how the candidates fit into the context of Ecuador's confrontational political landscape, and also the fear that many Ecuadorians have regarding freedom of expression and preserving democracy.
Regarding those who voted for Lasso, Arévalo Gross said:
Many people agree with Guillermo Lasso in that Ecuador needs to be saved.
That's why they're going to vote for him, they support and follow him.
Including those who don't support him, or follow him, but they voted for him in the first ballot for the plain and simple reason that Guillermo Lasso was the most likely to reach — indeed as he already has — a second ballot with Lenin Moreno, who's running for the government party, Alianza País.
And with regard to Lenin Moreno, Borja highlighted:
Has been portrayed as the friendly face of a political phenomenon lead by a volatile, intolerant and impulsive character The notion that Moreno is a patriot is reiterated by his supporters and refined by his campaign team.
There's an impenetrable wall that makes it difficult to get to him and see him outside of this heroic image that his advisers portray.
Others consider Lasso to be too conservative to appeal to the political centre's vote, which could have changed the outcome.
Lasso didn't want to please anybody...
As a society we should be unyielding against the most corrupt government in history...
Voting day was full of setbacks.
Complaints about polling stations circulated on social media, and organisations such as Usuarios Digitales (Digital Users), which follows citizen trends across online media, were accused of foul play for sharing information that could be inconvenient for candidates close to the government.
#DigitalAlertEC: Web page for election monitoring from CREO political party is currently offline.
Possible DDoS attack
There were comparisons made to other political situations in the Latin American region.
For many, the rise of Moreno to power is a continuation of agendas similar to the political and economic strategies seen in Venezuela, which has been at the centre of intense debate due to its political and economic crisis.
I hope what happened in Vzla is an example for Ecuador, that the vote will be a resounding NO to socialist dictatorship in the 21st century #EcuadorChooses2017
Similarly, allegations of fraud evoked accusations made during Venezuela's 2013 elections between Nicolás Maduro, the current president of Venezuela, and Henrique Capriles, his most important opponent:
The same thing that happened in Venezuela in April 2013 is happening now in Ecuador.
Capriles won and then National Election Council proclaimed Maduro with 1% lead.
Fraud
They're doing the same to #GuillermoLasso in Ecuador as they did to Capriles in #Venezuela.
No to FRAUD! #LassoPresident
Lasso announced that he will call for a recount of votes and that he will accept the outcome even if he loses "by one vote".
In light of the country's unmistakable division, some concluded:
Dividing the country into two irreconciliable parts with a 50% split : Rafael Correa Delgado's greatest achievement.
Just what we needed in a political and economic crisis, a president whose electoral legitimacy is called into question.
Keep it up!
Beyond allegations of fraud or the notion of a political party increasing in power, the concerns and tensions over corruption and limitations to freedom of expression continue.
Migrants rescued from an inflatable raft.

Aware Migrants is a social media campaign that aims at informing migrants from 15 African countries about the dangers of migrating across the Sahara desert, Libya and the Mediterranean Sea.
For years, thousands of migrants and refugees from Africa and Middle East have been trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe to escape poverty and political persecution.
The project is organised by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), with the technical and creative support of Horace communication agency, and financed by the Italian Ministry of Interior, Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration.
IOM reported last March 10, 2017 that 19,567 migrants arrived by sea to Italy but 521 have died at sea, which is 50 more compared to the same period in 2016.
Majority of the migrants were from Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Guinea, Senegal and Gambia.
Some migrants told IOM that their journey was far more dangerous than expected:
Many are unaware of the dangers and risks of migrating with the assistance of smugglers, not only at sea or in the desert, but also in transit countries like Libya.
Recalling the life-threatening risks along their journey is often very distressing and in many instances, most migrants wish to forget and move forward with their lives and therefore tend not to share their experience with peers who are still back home.
The campaign has already produced 31 video testimonies.

It's April Fool's Day—"Day of Laughter" in the Russian-speaking world—and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has seized the opportunity to indulge in some geopolitical satire, delighting in the attention Russia has drawn for interfering in the 2016 American presidential election.
The MFA posted a video of a joke Russian Embassy voicemail recording on its Facebook page this morning with the caption, "The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has worked out a full voicemail recording for all Russian diplomatic missions abroad."
"Good day!
You have reached the Russian Embassy.
Your call is very important to us.
To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponent, press 1.
To use the services of Russian hackers, press 2.
To request election interference, press 3 and wait until the next election campaign.
Please note that all calls are monitored for quality control and training purposes."
Take a listen here (the English version of the voicemail begins at 0:29):
Marta Sam sings with a classroom of four-year-olds.

Marta Sam is surrounded by really energetic 4-year-olds.
She’s at St. Martin’s Day Care in Erie, Pennsylvania, guiding the kids as they sing and dance.
Sam sings in Arabic, then English.
She takes the students through a Congolese song, followed by "Five Little Monkeys Jumping On The Bed."
The kids follow her cues, dancing and calling out their favorite songs.
Sam is used to this.
“When they see me in the classroom they say, 'Miss Marta can we do this?
Miss Marta can we sing this?
Miss Marta can we jump?'" she says.
"Yeah, I will jump with them and get silly like them — working with the kids you just get down in their level and just ... mess with them."
Sam, 59, is a roving educator at St. Martin's Day Care.
She goes from room to room and sings lullabies from all over the world with the kids.
Originally from South Sudan, she came to Erie 13 years ago as part of the first wave of thousands of refugees who have resettled in this small Rust Belt city.
She worked at a plastics factory and started learning English.
Then she heard she could get job training to work in day cares.
In return she’d share the traditional songs she had sung to her children when they were young.
It was just what she needed.
“Oh, it changed my life very much. ... I’m somebody now,” she says.
Sam works at St. Martin’s because of Old Songs, New Opportunities, a program dreamed up by Kelly Armor, a folklorist and educator at the Erie Art Museum.
Armor is from Erie, but spent time in the 1980s studying traditional song in Kenya and Tanzania.
When she noticed refugees settling in Erie in recent years, she had an idea.
“Could it be that ... there are refugee women that are, would love to work with small children?
And could it be that they know lots of songs and they know how to use songs with kids?” she wondered.
It turned out they did, and in some cases the songs were all they bought to the US.
That was the case for Victoria Angelo, who is also from South Sudan.
“I was not able to bring anything.
No dishes, nothing, no ,” she says.
“What I actually brought with me was the songs.”
But in some ways the songs represented everything that was missing.
“It's just expressing our feelings, our happiness, our sadness, the war going on, expressing the season, when there is heavy rain, when there is drought,” she says.
Victoria Angelo and some of the toddlers she works with.

Armor, the folklorist, got funding to train women like Angelo and Sam so they could get jobs in child care.
Then, just as she had done in Africa, she collected and translated their songs.
Combining job training and musical tradition has been so successful, the museum released a CD.
Angelo sings some of the songs, like the one from the Acholi people that is sung when a child begins to toddle.
“It is a way to call the child to toddle to you and then you sing to that child to turn around and then somebody else sings to that child,” explains Armor.
In the United States, some of the most popular children’s songs already come from overseas — think "London Bridge Is Falling Down" or "Ring Around The Rosie."
But every country and culture has these types of songs, and with migration and assimilation, they can be lost — or gained.
Armor has archived nearly a hundred songs from almost as many countries and cultures.
They're about everything — animals, emotions, experiences.
One Nepalese song is about climbing mango trees at recess to pick ripe fruit.
“But at the end of the song the bell rings and you don’t get the mango," she says. "I think of that as kind of, well there you go, there’s an eternal truth.
Recess will never be long enough.
And sometimes you don’t get time to eat that mango."
Here is a selection of the songs from the CD "Simba La La: World Music for Children," courtesy of the Erie Art Museum.
This song is about the green fly, an insect found in South Asia.
It lovingly describes the fly and then proclaims the fly is better when its outside:
When Congolese children sing this, they flap their hands on either side of their head:
This song is similar to the classic American children's song "I’m A Little Teapot":
The English translation of this song uses locations in Erie that the children will recognize:
Environmentalists in Krasnoyarsk appeal to Dr. DiCaprio.
Image: Vkontakte
According to a popular legend many Russians learn in school, the Russian people 11 centuries ago invited “managers” from Scandinavia to come and help rule over their lands.
The so-called "Varangian" tribe leaders (coming from the territories of modern Sweden and Norway) had a knack for good governance, and they were enormously helpful in Old Rus, the story goes.
The age of the Varangians came and went, but some Russians today are still looking abroad for another savior.
In Krasnoyarsk, the third largest city in Siberia, local environmentalists have found their man: Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio.
In order to draw attention to air pollution that's choking their home, local activists recently displayed several large banners throughout the city bearing DiCaprio's handsome face, with a desperate appeal reading, “Leon, save Krasnoyarsk from coal!”
This was just the latest stunt in a campaign against local power plants that's lasted years.
Last month, for example, citizens held a public protest to demand that the powerhouses switch from coal to natural gas, which environmentalists hope would lower air pollution.
A founder of a wildlife conservation foundation in 1998 and a UN climate change ambassador, Leonardo DiCaprio is renown for his environmentalist work.
When accepting his Oscar award last year, he devoted a good deal of his acceptance speech to climate issues.
Krasnoyarsk environmentalists' appeal to DiCaprio represents a worldwide trend, when activists spend years hounding unresponsive local authorities, before appealing to the global viral community, in this case using a world-famous celebrity to draw attention to their cause.
Scholar Ethan Zuckerman (who co-founded Global Voices) coined the “cute cat theory of digital activism,” which suggests that somewhere between the images of adorable cats and brunch selfies, new forms of social activism can thrive.
By hanging banners appealing to Leonardo DiCaprio, environmentalists in Krasnoyarsk aren't putting direct pressure on the city's officials, but the publicity could bring the matter to their attention indirectly, perhaps more effectively than a traditional protest outside city hall.
A typical problem with viral campaigning is that struggles to transition from computer screens to the streets.
As unlikely as it probably is, what could really help the campaign in Krasnoyarsk would be for DiCaprio himself to publicize the situation in the city.
In the meantime, Russian Internet users are already finding the humor in Krasnoyarsk's strange public appeal.
“You're better off asking Chuck Norris for help.
Leo can only deal with the potholes,” some people have joked.
Showing an impressive grasp of DiCaprio's filmography, others have written in online comments: “They'll call in Tarantino for help with the street violence.”

Bus ride to Arusha, in Tanzania.

A bus carrying 40 people, majority of them primary school children and their teachers, plunged into a river in Arusha, northern Tanzania, killing at least 31 people, according to news reports.
The Associated Press later reported that a total of 35 people had died, including 32 children, citing statements from police officials.
The students were on a field trip, visiting a school in Karatu, a district in the region, and were later scheduled to travel to one of the natural wonders of the world, the Ngorongoro Crater, the Daily News, a local newspaper, said.
They never made it.
Eyewitness accounts describe a harrowing scene.
When the bus went past the Rhotia Hill Township, speeding downhill to the road section known as ‘Kwa-Karani’, eyewitnesses saw the vehicle being catapulted into the air and nose dive into the gorge adjacent to River Marera, in Karatu, according to the Daily News.
Social media circulated gruesome images of the upturned vehicle.
Grief as over 30 kids feared to have perished in road accident https://t.co/yIHXzYWCM5 pic.twitter.com/2b5dE2tNpe — The Citizen Tanzania (@TheCitizenTZ) May 6, 2017
"Many, many school children have been killed," Theresia Mahongo, Karatu's District Commissioner, told The Citizen, a local newspaper.
President John Magufuli said he was "shocked" and "saddened" by the news.
The accident has cut short the dreams of children who were preparing themselves to serve their nation, he said in a statement:
The most important thing right now is to pray for those killed, may they rest in peace, pray for those injured to heal quickly and to everyone affected by this tragedy, may their hearts have patience and perseverance in this difficult time.
There were reports that Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, had also sent his condolences to those hit by the tragedy:

Tanzania has one of the highest road fatality rates in Africa, according to the 2015 World Health Organisation's (WHO) global status report on road safety: In 2015, almost 3,600 people lost their lives due to traffic accidents, a slight decline from the year before, when close to 3,900 fatalities were reported.

Millions of workers are striking in Brazil against reforms set to weaken labour and pension laws pushed by the conservative government of Michel Temer, who replaced Dilma Rousseff as Brazil's president a year ago after a controversial impeachment process.
Public transportation has been partially shut down in most state capitals, including the country's largest, São Paulo.
Bankers, oil industry workers, teachers and civil servants are among the main laborers that stopped working for 24 hours, starting midnight, Friday, April 28.
They are led by social movement activists and trade union organizers, who are also staging public demonstrations.
Unlike the protests that have repeatedly occurred in Brazil over the past three years, these demonstrations are also taking place in smaller towns and the big cities' poorer suburbs.
Protesters have blocked some of the country's major interstate roads, bridges, airports and bus terminals since the early hours of the morning.
Many people have reported that the day feels like a Sunday or a holiday.
The last time Brazil witnessed a general strike of comparable proportions was in 1996 when Brazil was governed by another pro-austerity president.
On Twitter, the hashtags #GreveGeral #BrasilEmGreve trended all day on Friday.

The bill is part of a series of reforms hastily pushed by Temer, who enjoys a substantial legislative majority, as well as support from Brazil's business sector, despite his own sinking political popularity.
A poll by Ipsos released last week puts his approval rating at a measly 4 percent.
Other bills passed into law in the past year include a freeze on increases in public spending and legislation that lifts restrictions on outsourcing.
In the coming weeks, the Congress is also expected to vote on major pension reforms.
The government says the reforms are necessary to counter Brazil's massive public deficit and were first announced in late 2015 by the centrist political party PMDB in a document titled "Bridge to the Future." The plan was released shortly before the party ended its 12-year-old alliance with the Worker's Party — a crucial break that allowed Congress to impeach Dilma Rousseff easily in April 2016.
Rousseff was elected with 54 percent of the votes in October 2014 with a very different platform, raising questions about the legitimacy of the government's new reforms.
An ever-unfolding corruption scandal, with new pleas in the past weeks implicating major party leaders and Temer himself, has also increased public discontent and puts the country in a state of uncertainty until the 2018 general elections.
Temer himself will likely be prohibited from running in the elections, as he was convicted of violating electoral laws in 2014, leading critics to point out that he is now virtually unaccountable to future voters, as he pushes largely unpopular state policies.

Conservative groups like Movimento Brasil Livre and Vem pra Rua, which were at the forefront of the pro-impeachment protests in 2015 and 2016 and support the austerity reforms, say the protests are merely a political platform for the Worker's Party.
Both have started campaigns on social media calling on people to cross picket lines and go to work, while the Free Brazil Movement, which generally favors more aggressive rhetoric, has branded protestors "terrorists."

Police have dispersed some crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets, leaving other large demonstration groups untouched.
In São Paulo, police detained 16 activists from Brazil's Homeless Workers' Movement, which advocates social housing and is arguably Brazil's largest social movement today, reportedly charging them with “criminal association.”
In Rio de Janeiro, police dispersed a large crowd of protesters in the early evening.

A cross section of the crowd at the Tambourine Army Survivor Empowerment March Against Sexual Violence.
Photo by Storm Saulter, used with permission.
Under Jamaica's new cybercrime laws, activist La Toya Nugent was arrested in March 2017 for publicly naming alleged perpetrators of sexual violence via social media.
On May 17, 2017, the country's Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) dropped all charges against her, making Nugent a free woman, and vindicating her controversial Tambourine Army, a new movement led by women and survivors of sexual violence who are sharing their harrowing experiences, both online and in public.
The news broke on social media almost immediately.
On Facebook, writer Annie Paul announced:
Breaking news!!
DPP has dropped all 3 charges against Latoya Nugent under cyber crimes act!! #Tambourine!!
Twitter was also on the ball:
Twitter user Rachel Mordecai commented:
As it should be!
But might not have been.
Nugent had always maintained her innocence against the charges, which were summarized as the "use of a computer for malicious communication".
From the outset, many legal experts felt that the charges could not stick because the legislation left sufficient room for interpretation when it comes to unlawful or “malicious” communication.
In an offline context, the Tambourine Army's approach of naming and shaming perpetrators of sexual violence through its hashtag #SayTheirNames would most likely be classified as defamation.
But in 2013, Jamaica reformed its defamation regime to be treated as a matter of civil, not criminal, law.
So basically, if someone is convicted of defamation in Jamaica, they can be made to pay damages, but not be given a prison sentence.
As shared on Twitter, the country's DPP explained her discontinuation of the case:
UPDATE: DPP Llewelyn has discontinued prosecution of Activist Latoya Nugent o/c Stella on all 3 charges.

On the eve of May Day, a day where the world pauses to honour its workers, the government of Tanzania shamed thousands of civil servants in the country.
On April 28, President John Magufuli ordered the immediate firing of almost 10,000 civil servants after an investigation found that some government workers had been occupying their positions with forged qualifications.
"They are thieves like any other thieves," Magufuli was quoted as saying.
"They could be jailed for seven years as the law says."
#Today's editoon #TheCitizenToday pic.twitter.com/W3Jak3P1sg — The Citizen Tanzania (@TheCitizenTZ) 1 de mayo de 2017 This purge comes a year after the government found that it was losing billions of shillings annually to tens of thousands of “ghost workers.”
Safi sana' news It didn't take long for the internet to share its two shillings on the news.
Others were cracking jokes about the whole thing. Starting next Tuesday, if you see a public official not going to work, playing with the kids at home, don't ask too many questions!
Generally, the news received a lot of “poa sana” (very cool) “safi sana” (very nice) as people are pleased that some action is being taken over the issue.
Even former President Benjamin Mkapa came out publicly supporting Magufuli's move, saying the decision was "overdue."
...they love to give jobs to their family members...'
Of course, there were people who took the matter less lightly.
Hery Ayubu went on Twitter arguing for an independent commission to adjudicate the matter.
There should be an independent commission that will listen to the complaints of workers with fake certificates.
The government cannot judge its own case.
Meanwhile, one opposition party, Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT), tweeted that although they supported the government's drive against fake certificates in the civil service, they questioned whether the exercise went far enough.
The second issue that's not right are the statements by Minister Angellah Kairuki that the process of verifying certificates does not implicate politicians and government appointees.
The party went on to suggest that the decision amounted to the government protecting some of its appointees.
Not implicating political figures in the verification exercise is evidence of how the government is struggling to shield some of the president's appointees.
Felix Milinga agreed with the report that districts municipalities were the worst offenders, arguing that nepotism defines the way folks get civil service jobs.
At the district level is where they lead in fake certificates as they love to give jobs to their family members and those they know instead of looking at the expertise of candidates involved
Will the education system that provides low quality also be charged?'
Perhaps the most popular comment on the matter came from prominent law professor Issa Shivji who inquired about what action the government is taking against those with legitimate certificates but fake education.
From the street corner: Those with fake certificates have been fired/charged.
How about those with valid certificates but a fake education? Will the education system that provides low quality also be charged?
Dr Hellen Kijo-Bisimba, the executive director of the Legal and Human Rights Centre, suggested that in the future the government should ensure that folks with fake certificates don’t get hired at all.
"The war on fake certificates should be forward looking.
A system should be put in place to ensure no one would be employed if they use forged certificates,” Kijo-Bisimba told The Citizen, a local English daily.
Internationally, some people praised Magufuli's action and compared the problem of fake certificates to other countries.
Some commenters posting on BBC Africa's Facebook page applauded the Tanzanian president's move.
"The president has done a very recommendable job," Chimwemwe Tembo, whose profile says they are from Malawi, wrote:
Its indeed bad development.
I head that even some degrees are fake.
The president has done a very recommendable job.
Let those who fought for papers secure jobs.
In Malawi if that happens, then its on rare cases but many of us, we use genuine papers
Gezahegn Arebo, from Ethiopia, was also effusive in their praise:
Well done, Mr. President!
This is mostly an African problem,but the leaders arent willing to solve it; they are fake themselves!
The quantity of alleged forged certificates and reaction from the public deem this a prevalent issue in Tanzania.
It seems as though faulty education and recruitment systems combined with overlooked nepotism have kept this issue in the closet for many years.

International Women's Day in March 2017 became a tragic one for Guatemala after 41 girls burned to death in a blaze at a state-run home for children on the outskirts of Guatemala City.
After being locked in their dormitories for trying to escape abusive treatment, some of girls allegedly started a fire to force the guards to open the doors, but the guards refused.
Many of the crimes that are being investigated inside the shelter include torture and other cruel punishments.
The fact remains that these young women were underage girls in the custody of the state.
Two months after what many Guatemalans have dubbed the Hogar Seguro (Safe Home) massacre, authorities seem to be acting slowly and in secrecy to bring accountability and reparations to both the survivors and the families of the victims.
This has been the point of departure for certain members of civil society in Guatemala, who launched a global campaign on May 15 using the hashtag #NosDuelen56 ("We Feel the Pain of 56 ").
Participants are sharing 56 portraits, one of each of the girls killed or injured in the fire, that were made by artists from all over the world to demand that Guatemala's authorities act.

56 artists from 6 countries joined the #NosDuelen56.

All portraits can be found and shared from Flickr, Instagram and Facebook.
Several organisations are joining the call to action, lead by Guatemalan news agency Prensa Comunitaria ("Community Press") and distributed across 50 media outlets and thousands of social media accounts at once.
Anyone is free to share the pictures, print them or bring them to demonstrations demanding justice.
In their space in Medium, Prensa Comunitaria explained:
#NosDuelen56 is a cry for justice through art, journalism, online activism and feminism.
It's an exercise in collective memory for the dignity of the 56 girls who were locked up and burned in a state-run home in Guatemala on March 8 this year .
Of these girls, 41 died as a result of this femicide and 15 are badly hurt.
According to statistics presented by advocacy group Women for Justice, Education and Awareness, an average of one to two women are murdered daily.

This story by Maria Murriel originally appeared on PRI.org on June 2, 2017.
In late May, about 4,000 West African immigrants living and working legally in the US lost their immigration status.
They were formerly part of the temporary protected status program, or TPS, which the US offers to people from countries in crisis.
In 2014, TPS was granted to people from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak of Ebola there.
The World Health Organization has declared the Ebola outbreak over.
So on May 20, TPS expired for people from these nations, including a Liberian novelist named Paul, who asked to go by his first name only to protect his identity.
Now that his status is up, Paul is living in the US unauthorized — but he says it's impossible for him and others in his situation to return to Liberia.
"You cannot return because you don’t even have the money to pay your air ticket," he says.
Six months ago, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified TPS holders from these three West African countries that their status would be expiring.
The idea was they would use the time to make arrangements to return home, to avoid becoming undocumented in the US.

But Paul says being in the US on TPS has limited his work options, so he hasn't been able to save money for travel. "On this temporary status, if you want to look for a job, many don't want to give you a full-time job," Paul says, "because they look on your status you are just a short-term person, so they don't want to give you a long-term job.
And this is one of the things that I really suffered."
Paul says he has worked whatever odd jobs he could find, and after two or three years in the US, he managed to make his home here.
He lives in Sacramento, California, with his wife, whom he met in the US.
He has children back in Liberia, but he says his move to the US cost him other relationships.
"You came, not to stay, that was not the plan, and then you stayed here because of crisis, so you lost contact," he says. "You lost the people."
Paul says this is one of the flaws of TPS — that the government didn't take into consideration how immigrants would integrate into the US, even if they're meant to be here temporarily.
Jessica Vaughan, a critic of TPS with the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative thinktank based in Washington, DC, thinks the program is flawed because it allows people like Paul to stay in the country for too long — leading them to build ties and relationships.
"Many of these people have really settled here and the government has allowed this status to continue," Vaughan says. " almost like a backdoor legalization or amnesty program because very few people who've ever gotten temporary protected status have ever had to return home." TPS started in the late 1990s, and since then the US government has usually renewed the program every 18 months on a country-by-country basis.
In some occasions, the government has offered just a six-month renewal — as it did for Haitians recently.
Corina Bogaciu with the New York-based African Services Committee says TPS for West Africans actually ran out relatively quickly.
"That’s fairly unprecedented that TPS is this short, honestly," she says. "Most countries have gotten at least two full 18-month designations, and then they start to taper off."
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea got an initial 18-month period, followed by two six-month extensions.
Now that their TPS has expired, lawyers like Bogaciu aren’t sure what comes next.
She says there are plenty more people like Paul who can’t afford a plane ticket back to Africa.
"When you’re ordered removed, the government puts you on a plane and they pay for that," she says.
"But when you’re just expected to leave, then it’s really your responsibility to comply and leave by that deadline and if you don’t, then, you’re here unlawfully and you’re out of status."
DHS declined an interview request, instead referring PRI's The World to its website.
Bogaciu says some of her clients who lost TPS worry the government will start enforcing deportations against them. Some are able to apply for other forms of temporary protection due to medical issues.
Mit Philips, a health policy analyst for the aid group Doctors Without Borders, says that even though the Ebola crisis is over in West Africa, it's had long-lasting impact on the affected countries' fragile health systems.
"During the almost two years of the Ebola crisis, the health services could not function, really," Philips says.
"Plus the population was fearful of near to the health centers because the health centers were seen as places where you could get infected by Ebola."
That fear caused a lapse in general vaccinations, and earlier this year in Guinea, there was an outbreak of measles.
Philips says Liberia recently suffered a meningitis outbreak.
"So while the epidemic has ... been declared finished," Philips says, "of course it's not only Ebola in terms of health problems . ... And so then it all depends on how do you define risk in a broader way — and health risk, in particular."
Paul did have some relatives who contracted Ebola in 2014, but his main concern about having to return to Liberia isn't health related. He's worried about being able to find a job again.
Although it's been tough for him to find sustained work in the US, at least he's found temporary work, he says.
"It is very hard for you to get a job ," he explains. "They're not like in America where you can have a temporary job. you have an agency that can help you to get a job even if it is not a full-time job.
That is not happening in Africa, in that country."
Paul's wife is a legal permanent resident of the US.
She petitioned for him to become one in 2016, but the petition was denied.
Until they can submit another one, Paul is undocumented.
He can't find legal work, and he can't afford to return to Liberia.

There are about 65 million people worldwide right now who have fled their homeland.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says this is the highest such figure since the second world war.
As tragic as that is, it's even more heartbreaking to realize that many of those folks have lost contact with their families.
But help may be on the way.
Two Danish brothers and social entrepreneurs David and Christopher Mikkelsen have found a solution to this challenge.
Their platform, REFUNITE, for Refugees United, has registered more than half a million migrants around the world to re-establish lost contact with their families.
Here is a video that summarizes the principles of the project:
Earlier this year, the Mikkelsen brothers were named social entrepreneurs of the year by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for their efforts.
Upon the announcement, their website published this explanation on how the platform works:
The family reconnection platform is accessible from a simple mobile phone via SMS, USSD, web or a free hotline.
Whether it is an Afghan refugee in Pakistan or an internally displaced person in Iraq, anyone in need can search, re-connect and communicate with their missing loved ones – even if they are unable to pay for mobile data.
Despite the gratification of bringing in the 500,000th person onto the REFUNITE platform and starting them on a journey of reconnecting them to their family, the brothers have not forgotten about the significance of the platform:
While this is an achievement to note, it comes with the somber reminder that these are people unable to find their children, siblings, parents and friends.
Unfortunately, it also doesn’t stop here: the world is harboring more displaced people than we’ve seen since WWII!
And while Syria is responsible for both the largest numbers of its citizens on the run and the most headlines, there are unfortunately many other crises in full bloom, and numerous new ones threatening to erupt at any moment.
REFUNITE will continue to work tirelessly to help everyone looking for loved ones to reconnect.
Our aim is to continuously build out our platform to provide a digital home and infrastructure to soon millions of displaced people.
REFUNITE is headquartered in Kenya, but was first created in Denmark in collaboration with Ericsson.
It is funded by the IKEA Foundation and other private foundations and it has partnership with a global coalition of mobile operators and with Facebook.
So far close to 11 million messages have passed through the platform and has performed over 9 million searches, with 600,000 total registrations all over the world.
By 2017 REFUNITE aims to register 1 million displaced people.

This story was written for Syria Untold by Jood Mahbani, a Homs-based journalist and civil activist, and translated by Yaaser Azzayyaat.
It was originally published on May 8, 2017 and is republished here in two parts as part of a partnership agreement.
Read part one below. For part two, click here.
“Idlib, Jarablus, or Homs northern countryside?”
This is the question often asked by the residents of the Syrian city of Al-Waer, west of Homs city and part of Homs district, when inquiring about each other’s different destinations.
Rebels and their families are evacuating their last bastion in the city that has been dubbed “the capital of the revolution,” following a Russia-brokered agreement.
After six years of war, which began as a popular uprising against the Assad regime, the latter is regaining control with the support of both Russia and Iran.
As per the agreement, which was signed on March 13, 2017, by both the regime delegation and Al-Waer Neighborhood Committee, the exodus will take place in batches, until the departure of the last person wishing to leave the district, at which point it will be handed over to the Syrian regime forces.
Since no substantial guarantees have been offered, many of the residents have opted to venture to the “unknown” instead of awaiting the “inevitable,” according to Ibtisam Al-Masri, a mother of four children.
(Pseudonyms have been used throughout this story for security purposes.)
She imagined that the fate of the district would at best be similar to that of Eastern Aleppo.
“They will not leave anything unlooted,” she added, before stepping into one of buses that would take the fifth batch of exiles to the city of Jarablus.
“They will retaliate against all those who stay, which is why I’m leaving… no way could I stay and watch them murder us and raid our homes.”
The opposition media stress that the Homs district is on the brink of descending into systematic demographic transformation engineered by the Syrian regime, as has been the case in cities such as Daraya, Al-Qusayr and Eastern Aleppo, all of which have previously been besieged and ultimately evacuated.
However, the situation in Al-Waer is far more ambiguous and complex, and it is yet unclear whether the regime is actually willing to evacuate all of its inhabitants before deploying its forces.
The Al-Waer evacuation deal has been peculiarly marked by the opening of crossings to allow civilian property owners to enter before the regime forces do so.
It also included the option to remain for those willing, unlike what had happened in Eastern Aleppo, for example, where all civilians had been evacuated before regime forces entered.
Nonetheless, the mistrust of people in the Russian patronage, as the sole guarantor of the deal, in addition to the armed Shiite villages that are adjacent to Al-Waer (Zarzuriya, Hayek and Mazraa) have led to widespread dread in the district.
There have circulated many rumors that there are Shiites militants in Mazraa village (which is contiguous to al-Waer) awaiting the last batch of rebels to evacuate the district in order to raid the remaining civilians and persecute them.
Consequently, the civilian population has been caught between the grim prospects of being displaced and uprooted, on the one hand, or remaining in a state of uncertainty, on the other, each of which is an infinitely difficult choice to make.
I don’t want to leave my house, my belongings, my memories'
Hayyan Al-Siufi, a 30-year-old civil activist, described the last five years he has spent under siege as “years of loss.”
He described to SyriaUntold the harsh conditions of bombardment, besiegement and destruction of infrastructure, admitting his regret for not having decided to emigrate since the beginning of the armed turmoil in Syria.
“I do not know, what all of that was for?” he added in bewilderment.
“Why have we remained patient?
For us to finally be displaced like this and leave our homes and loved ones?”
Hayyan is only one of thousands of young people in Al-Waer who are eligible for forced conscription or reserve duty, and who have preferred to remain in the rebel-held enclave since 2011 and did not travel abroad.
They had hopes that the war would one day come to an end, and they be exempted from the compulsory service or reserve enlistment.
However, as the evacuation of the district became a reality, with only a few weeks remaining for the batches to be concluded, most of them decided to register their names to leave.
They refused to stay for fear of the same old-new concern, that is, the compulsory military service in the Syrian regime’s military.
Moreover, if men under the age of 40 quickly determined to leave to opposition-controlled areas, the harder decision concerned their families and relatives.
These have mixed priorities, responsibilities, fears and expectations.
Stranded between their attachment to the roots as well as to their departing sons, a lot of families have been split in their decisions, with some withdrawing their request to register the chosen destination and re-submitting it several times.
“We registered for Idlib in order to promptly leave for Turkey.
We then realized that smuggling is not that easy and never inexpensive, so we decided to change to Jarablus,” said Umm Rami, justifying her presence with a group of residents at one of the registration centers, despite the expiry of the deadline for choosing a destination.
As SyriaUntold spoke to her, it was revealed that she is a government employee, and that her husband’s age exceeds the required age for reserve.
They nonetheless opted to leave with their three children out of concern for them.
“The elder is 26, and he is wanted for reserve, the middle is 20 and is wanted for compulsory service, and the youngest is 15 which means he is approaching the age of military service.”
Wrapping the neck with her palms as to alleviate agony, she added in a hoarse voice: “I feel horribly defeated.
I don’t want to leave my house, my belongings, my memories, but I also cannot leave my children at this age.”
At the registration center for the assigned destinations (Idlib, Jarablus, Homs northern countryside), people exchange advice and share information obtained by those who preceded them to one of those destinations.
Some sweeping statements that have been repeated more than once by several people take the form of mantras circulating in the neighborhood as scientific fact.
“Idlib has cheap rent costs for homes,” “Idlib’s problem is that it’s dangerous and subject to bombing,” “Those choosing Idlib are in fact choosing Turkey through a smuggling route,” “The regime forces will arrest all those who remain in the neighborhood,” “Jarabulus is safe, but dwellings are very difficult to secure,” “If you could live in a tent then you can go to Jarablus,” “The northern countryside will soon suffer the same fate of Al-Waer.”
Umm Rami retreats from a group of women talking, leaving the ladies behind her to resume their conversation.
She drags her feet with difficulty, holding tears which could not but overflow from her eyes.
“All of this is pointless,” she told SyriaUntold.
“We are swarmed with details, and are amusing ourselves with which destination is better, Idlib or Jarablus… but we are missing an important thing: It’s all the same!
We’re leaving!”
Salvador Adame.
Image widely circulated on Twitter.
The burned body of Salvador Adame, a journalist and founder of local news channel 6TV, was discovered in the western Mexican state of Michoacan, authorities announced on June 26:
After taking and comparing the fingerprint samples required by the law in these proceedings by specialists from the Genetics Direction, the DNA tests let us conclude that these remains belong to Salvador Adame Pardo, as he was called when he was alive.
Adame had been kidnapped by an armed group almost a month before, according to reports in the national newspaper La Jornada.
The region where his body was found is popularly known as Tierra Caliente (Hot Land), and is one of the most violent in Michoacán, a state that in the last few years has seen a disproportionate growth in criminality and accusations of collusion between the local government and organized crime.
Independent news outlet Animal Político reported that before his death Adame had received threats on several occasions, warning him to stop his work as a journalist.
His wife Frida Urtiz said she felt enormous pressure as well because of the work she did with Adame:
My husband and I are the owners of the news channel.
We had publicity contracts with the municipality of Múgica to do the job that all administrations must do: inform citizens.
We desisted because of the pressure we received.
A note published by 6TV itself described Adame this way:
The journalist, who was subject of police harassment over a year ago, maintained an active, critic, astute, bold and brave leadership against the criminal atmosphere that prevailed in the area, also known as Cuatro Caminos, the heart of the state and the center of endless gang battles.
Adame is the seventh journalist murdered in Mexico in 2017, as human rights defender Cencos pointed out.
They tweeted a GIF that explains how Adame was found, demands justice and concludes with the statement, "Truth is not killed when a journalist is killed":
#SalvadorAdame is the seventh journalist that has been killed since the beginning of the year.
We demand clarity and a stop to all aggression. #NoToSilence.
The impact of these attacks against journalists in Mexico goes beyond the reporters themselves.
Frida Urtiz, for example, suffered grave health problems after the abduction of her husband.
Recently, a high representative of the Secretariat of the Interior, Roberto Campa, appeared to downplay the gravity of the situation when he said that compared to past administrations, this is not the the worst period of violence against reporters in Mexico.
It is true, however, that violence against those who practice journalism in Mexico is not something new.
In 2015, journalist Isabel Uribe wrote:
In Mexican journalism, the ink constantly smells of death.
The assassination of nine journalists since the beginning of 2015 confirm how Mexico is one of the most dangerous places on the planet to practice this profession, a Pandora's box that hides the most horrific atrocities: aggression, intimidation, torture, forced disappearances, self-censorship and death.
After news of Adame's death broke, Luis De Tlacuilo, a Twitter user, made the following comment:
It's sad to realize that someone could be killed while practicing his profession. #SalvadorAdame
Journalist Jenaro Villamil condemned the local government:
Another journalist killed. #SalvadorAdame.
After weeks of being disappeared under Michoacan government's indolence.
The office in charge of protecting human rights in Mexico pressed other government institutions to act:
CDNH calls on authorities at all three levels of government to investigate and solve the murder of #SalvadorAdame.
Salvador Adame joins the list of journalists who have been assassinated in 2017, a list that includes Miroslava Breach and Javier Valdez.
President John Magufuli, second left, with Barrick Gold executives at State House on June 14.

A version of this post appeared on Mtega.com, Ben Taylor's personal blog.
The piece is republished here with permission.
On June 14, John Magufuli, the president of Tanzania, met with John Thornton, the chairman of Barrick Gold—the world’s largest gold mining company—who had flown in from North America for the purpose.
Reports of the meeting dominated the headlines in Tanzania for the next several days.
The subject of the meeting was the "mineral concentrates" produced by Barrick subsidiary Acacia Mining plc at its three gold mines in Tanzania.
On March 5, 2017, a large number of containers containing concentrates were seized for investigation, and exports suspended.
The committees appointed by the president to carry out these investigations accused Acacia Mining of massively understating the amount of gold and other minerals present in the exported concentrates, thus depriving Tanzania of a huge amount of revenue—to the tune of three years’ worth of the national budget.
Acacia and Barrick were alarmed, and disputed the committees’ findings, insisting their exports have always been audited and declared accurately, and that all payments of tax and royalties, etc. to the Tanzanian government had been made.
For a few weeks, Acacia had been calling for dialogue with the Tanzanian government so the issue could be resolved.
(This post on Bloomberg offers a comprehensive account of the matter).
An accompanying statement by State House made similar claims, saying that Barrick had agreed to pay what the government has said its owed to them.
The president said, on top of agreeing to pay what they owe us, Prof. John L. Thornton has agreed to work with Tanzania to build a smelter in the country.
Based on Barrick's comments, the meeting seems to have concluded with an agreement to have further discussions, nothing more, nothing less.
There was no consensus reached on the amount of money—if any—owed by Acacia/Barrick to the government of Tanzania, nor any admission of liability on the company's part.
The government's own official press release on the meeting supports this conclusion, as do Thornton's comments after the meeting and the latest press release on the Acacia website and the market update call they held on the morning of June 15.
The next day following the meeting, however, six Swahili papers portrayed the meeting as a big win for the president and for Tanzania, going well beyond even what the president himself said about the meeting.
Some stated that Acacia/Barrick agreed to pay what is being demanded of them, or that they have admitted responsibility for wrongdoing, neither of which is reflected in the actual agreement reached.
From top left: Habari Leo, "Barrick agrees to end the matter".
Imani, "Listen young man, there is no weakness here".
Majira, "Acacia bows down to the government".
Uhuru, "Acacia heeds the order".
Nipashe, "Acacia to pay".
Mwananchi, "JPM: They repented".
Two other Swahili papers took a different line, focusing instead on an issue mentioned in the second part of President Magufuli’s post-meeting remarks, in which he condemned the media's attacks on former Presidents Benjamin Mkapa and Jakaya Kikwete accusing them of alleged lax oversight of the mining sector.
"I have read both reports and there nowhere is it mentioned that Mr. Mkapa and Mr. Kikwete are implicated. Media outlets should stop tarnishing the names of these men, who did a great job of serving their country, they should be allowed to rest in their retirement," President Magufuli said.
From Left: Mawio, "Invalid".
Tanzania Daima, "Not Allowed to touch Mkapa, Kikwete".
The weekly tabloid Mawio, which did not heed Magufuli's call, was subsequently suspended for two years by the government for linking the two former presidents to the scandal. #gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 25%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */
Three English-language papers took a more measured tone, but it's still hard to agree with the sentiment expressed in The Guardian and Daily News headlines.
Was the "Battle won"?
Were Acacia "hiding"?
The Citizen’s headline came closest to expressing the reality of what happened, as did their coverage in general, notably a balanced and sensible editorial, which stated that:
Now that the ground has been set for negotiations, our prayer is that both the parties will engage in earnest talks based on good intentions for mutual benefit. t is in the interest of both parties to find a middle ground and secure a win-win situation, for we wouldn’t like to see this standoff degenerate into a fully-blown crisis with devastating consequences.
The situation was also misread by several cartoonists.
Nipashe and Mtanzania were off the mark, Mwananchi managed to sidestep the main point, and Daily News used aggressive imagery.
The Citizen’s cartoonist did better, but Gado, who did not publish his cartoon in any of the papers, went in a completely different direction from everyone else.
Nipashe, 15/6/17: “Let’s end this”.
Mwananchi, 15/6/17: “You can use it as a trench in wartime”.
Mtanzania, 15/6/17: “He has agreed to pay”.
Gado, 15/6/17: “You want to run and you have no brake – what do you expect to happen?”.
Daily News 15/6/17.
The Citizen, 15/6/17: “We want our money back”.
The varying interpretations of the outcome of the meeting between Magufuli and Thornton by the Tanzanian media raises the question of whether these journalists and editors are aware they were potentially misleading the public; and if they did know, why were they doing so?
Could it have anything to do with the law that allows the government to suspend Mawio so easily?
Could they be worried that what happened to Mawio could happen to others as well?
Those who spread fake news through the social media are also liable under the proposed bill.

Philippine Senator Joel Villanueva filed a bill in late June that would criminalize the “malicious distribution of false news.”
Media groups are warning it could lead to censorship.
Villanueva’s Senate Bill No. 1492 or “An Act Penalizing the Malicious Distribution of False News and Other Related Violations” defines fake news as “those which either intend to cause panic, division, chaos, violence, and hate, or those which exhibit a propaganda to blacken or discredit one's reputation.”
The bill assigns penalties to those who publish "fake news" and even to those who share it, potentially criminalizing social media users who may not fully understand the implications of simply sharing an article with friends.
Prison sentencing under the proposed law depends on the status of the entity who publishes or spreads the so-called "fake news".
A private individual found guilty of publishing or spreading fake news can face a prison term of up to five years.
A government official's sentence would be double that of a private individual.
And a media entity or social media platform spreading fake news could be detained for up to 20 years.
Villanueva explained the rationale behind these penalties:
The effect of fake news should not be taken lightly.
Fake news creates impression and beliefs based on false premises leading to division, misunderstanding and further exacerbating otherwise strenuous relations.
He added that the passage of the bill “will encourage our citizens, especially public officers, to be more responsible and circumspect in creating, distributing and/or sharing news.”
Journalism Professor Danilo Arao reviewed the four-page bill and summarized his objections:
Definition of "false news or information" under Sec. 2 is so broad that it includes practically anything perceived to cause, among others, panic and hate (obviously hard to define)… Media organizations could be subjected to censorship under Sec. 3 of the proposed law because even fair commentary or investigative reports that are perceived to tarnish the reputation of a public official could be flagged as "false news".
Arao further disputed the need for a special law mentioning public officials, reasoning that they are already assumed to be following a code of conduct.
In a TV interview, a spokesperson from the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility said the proposed legislation is unnecessary because Philippine libel law already addresses the issues raised by the senator.
A member of the House of Representatives proposed that instead of criminalizing fake news, the congress should work to approve a pending Freedom of Information bill that he says would help counter the irresponsible sharing of false information on media and the Internet.
AlterMidya, a network of independent media groups, denounced Villanueva’s bill as “irresponsible, unnecessary and dangerous attempt to impose a form of censorship on free expression and press freedom.”
How does one distinguish between a false report based on an honest mistake and one maliciously spread through print, broadcasting and online?
It would endow the bureaucracy with the arbitrary power to declare any media issuance contrary to government interests as fake news, while approving, loudly or otherwise, even the most fraudulent report from either private or State media so long as it favors whatever regime is in power.
Veteran journalist Luis Teodoro reminded the senator that there are better ways to fight fake news:
Accountability in the exercise of the right to communicate is best enforced, not by the State, but by the media community itself as well as by a public media-literate and responsible enough to detect and not to spread fake news.
Philippine Star newspaper columnist Jarius Bondoc warned that if the bill becomes law, it could be abused by authorities who want to silence critics:
The bill is prone to abuse.
A bigot administration can apply it to suppress the opposition.
By prosecuting critics as news fakers, the government can stifle legitimate dissent.
Whistleblowers, not the grafters, would be imprisoned and fined for daring to talk.
Investigative journalists would cram the jails.
This is not the first time that a Philippine legislator has filed a bill that seeks to address the negative impact of fake news.
Early this year, the Speaker of the House of Representatives proposed regulating social media to prevent the spread of fake accounts and fake information.
“I understand how hard it is to take care of little kids,” says 19-year-old Luis Duarte, second from right, who is now caring for his three younger siblings after his parents, originally from Mexico, were detained by US immigration agents in late May.

This story by Deepa Fernandes originally appeared on PRI.org on June 11, 2017.
As 19-year-old Francisco Duarte watched his parents handcuffed and driven away by immigration officials in late May outside their San Diego, California, home, all he could do was console his hysterical 12-year-old twin sisters.
Then he took off to find help for his parents.
They would need an immigration attorney, and Francisco would need to gather their paperwork.
His younger brother Luis, 17, stepped up to look after the younger sisters — he cooked them eggs and ham when they came home from school that day.
The brothers were busy figuring out all the household chores, making sure they had their little sisters taken care of.
And then it hit the brothers.
Rent was due in less than a week.
They were now going to have to pay all the family’s bills.
Duarte said he and his brother gathered all the money his parents had.
It came to $2,500.
They would need to supplement their father's income somehow.
He was the breadwinner, running the family ice-cream business.
“My mom and my dad met selling ice cream from pushcarts 20 years ago when they came to this country,” Duarte said.
While Francisco and Luis push their own ice cream carts to help out, neither could bring in the money that their farther did, Duarte said.
Francisco Duarte Sr. and his wife, Rosenda Perez, were arrested by immigration agents on May 23.
Duarte had left his National City, California, home to buy a newspaper across the street.
His wife came out to see what was going on and she was arrested too.
Officials say they have been charged with “immigration violations” in the US.
There are no criminal charges against them, and neither has a criminal record.
The San Diego couple are among a growing number of non-citizens arrested on civil immigration charges during the first months of the Donald Trump administration.
From January 22 to April 29, more than 41,000 people suspected of living in the US without proper authorization have been arrested by federal agents — nearly a 40 percent increase from the same period in 2016, according to US officials.
A quarter of those arrested are charged with being in the US without legal status, but have no prior criminal records.
It’s a group that was not targeted as heavily by the Barack Obama administration.
The latest numbers show Trump is making good on his campaign promise to change that, as detailed recently by reporter Maria Sacchetti at The Washington Post.
Before his arrest, Duarte was able to pass custody of his three younger children to Luis, his oldest son.
For the kids, it's been a whirlwind.
On a recent Tuesday, Francisco sought commmunity members to write letters of support for his parents.
He arrived back home hungry.
“I’ve been out all morning," said Luis.
"We've just been hectic, doing as much as we can for our parents, so yeah, breakfast at 2:37 p.m.”
Mark Lane, a legal assistant at an LA-based immigration law firm, sat with Francisco, and they discussed what else needed to be collected for his parent’s case.
Lane was one of the people Francisco called for help the day his parents were arrested.
“Pre-Trump administration, maybe I got two to three calls a week, now I get 10 to 15 calls a day,” Lane said.
“People are very scared, families are being split up.”
Lane, whose firm has taken the case of Francisco’s parents, talked to the kids about the expenses they would need to pay.
All four children are in school, leaving little time to work and bring in income.
So they decided to turn to a terrain they know well: social media.
They created a short video about their situation, posted it to YouTube, and linked it to a GoFundMe fundraising page.
They set their fundraising goal at $70,000 and, just days later, they had surpassed it.
More than $72,000 in donations have come in so far.
They’re stunned and grateful.
But it wasn’t just money rolling in — people were also reaching out to say we support you.
“It’s just very uplifting that every day I get messages from people and they’re just letting me know that they’re there for me and if there’s anything that I need they’re just a phone call, a text away,” Francisco said.
The older Francisco found it hard to comprehend the social media campaign his kids are pursuing on his behalf, his son said.
During a recent phone call, the younger Francisco explained to his father how money and support was coming in.
His dad asked who was donating. “Many people,” his son told him.
“Teachers, neighbors, friends, people from around the city,” he told his father during their telephone conversation.
As word spread on social media, friends began coming by the house to help.
A group of Luis’s friends from school are helping out.
Luz Maria Castañon said they don’t want Luis to suffer at school.
“He’s going to be valedictorian, honestly. nothing compared to his GPA.”
In the kitchen, another friend, Maria de Jesus, cooks up some tacos.
She said should would cook for the children until their parents come back home.
The twin sisters, Aracely and Yarely, watched their parents get handcuffed and be taken away by immigration officials.
It was confusing, Aracely said, and they miss them a lot.
Especially when they come home from school.
“Usually my mom would be here and she would sometimes have a little snack prepared,” Yarely said.
The girls are not identical twins, but they both have the same sweet, kind of sad smile.
They busy themselves putting things away in their room.
“Sometimes it is a bit overwhelming but, um, …” Yarely trails off.
Luis checks in on his sisters, makes sure they are OK, and then has to leave.
“I’m going to go and do laundry right now because our sheets are really nasty," he said.
Is this his job normally?
“Nah, not really."
After the laundry, he has to be home for his sisters.
His brother will continue gathering letters of support for their parents.
“I understand how hard it is to take care of little kids now,” Luis said.
Six of the human rights defenders who were detained on July 5, 2017.
Images shared widely on Twitter under the hashtag #İnsanHaklarıSavunucularınaDokunma.
Eight of Turkey's best-known human rights defenders were arrested during a digital security and information management workshop on one of Istanbul's islands, Buyukada, on July 5.
Two trainers were also arrested along with the rights defenders.
Police also briefly detained the owner of the hotel where the event was held.
Among those arrested is the director of Amnesty International Turkey, Idil Eser.
Independent media outlet Bianet reported that police in plainclothes raided the workshop, detained the participants, and confiscated electronic equipment including computers and mobile phones.
The eight Turkish citizens will be held for seven days pre-trial.
Less than a month ago Amnesty International's Turkey chair, Taner Kilic was also remanded in prison.
Amnesty International released a statement on July 6:
(Idil Eser's) incommunicado detention and that of the other human rights defenders attending a routine training event, is a grotesque abuse of power and highlights the precarious situation facing human rights activists in the country.
Idil Eser and those detained with her, must be immediately and unconditionally released.
The reaction at home and abroad has been immediate, with Twitter supporters clamoring for the release of the eight advocates, all of whom are experts in their field, using the hashtags #İnsanHaklarıSavunucularınaDokunma and #freehumanrightsdefenders.

No information is given to lawyers, journalists, and attorneys.
They act as if they just cracked down on some very serious, and very dangerous organization.
The pro-government news agency Ahaber was quick to denounce the rights defenders as "agents", calling to mind a similar incident that took place before the 15 July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey:
ON THE HUNT FOR AGENTS A group of 17 people, consisting mostly of foreigners, checked in at a hotel in Buyukada on July 15.
They held meetings for two days.
One of the participants who attracted the most attention was a CIA employee, American professor Henry Barkey.
Ahaber referred to the training event as "reminiscent of a meeting ahead of July 15," but did not offer any details about the who attended the supposed meeting last year.
Turkey's AKP (Justice and Development Party) leadership is routinely accused of using last year's coup attempt as a justification for purging the government of non-loyalists and dissolving what remains of civil society and independent media in the country.
The country remains in a condition of "emergency rule" that grants broad powers to security services.
Responding to the story in Abaher, one of Turkey's best-known lawyers tweeted:
In this country, anyone can be announced being a terrorist at any time.
Even those who have those have only protected the right to life and living.
The people mentioned in this news story are people who have dedicated their lives to human rights.
A day will come when they will stand for the rights of those behind these vile news stories.

The detentions occurred on the eve of EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn's July 6 visit to Ankara to discuss Turkey's troubled accession bid, after the European parliament called for a suspension of negotiations.
At a time when almost all the news about Puerto Rico in mainstream media is firmly focussed on the island's fiscal and economic woes, the deluge of negative headlines making the rounds on social media can feel overwhelming.
The Juice Media, a Facebook page which specializes in satire, created a video about what it believes to be the root cause of many of Puerto Rico's troubles and disadvantages: US colonialism.
Widely shared on Facebook, its creators were encouraged to produce the clip after the success of a similar video about Hawai'i in their "Honest Government Advert" series.
The video summarizes some of the ways the US government has historically exploited Puerto Rico, from using it as a bombing practice site for decades, to sterilizing over a third of Puerto Rican women without their knowledge or consent in the mid-twentieth century.
The cheery presenter in the clip begins:
Fortunately, however, few know about the real Puerto Rico, a Territory of the United States since 1898 when we seized it from the Spanish who in turn stole it from the Taino Which makes Puerto Ricans US citizens—well second-class citizens… despite fighting in every one of our wars they still can’t vote for President and have no representation in Congress.
In other words, US citizens who have f*-all say in the laws the US Government makes for them...

2017 marks a century since the establishment of the Polish Supreme Court, but instead of celebrating, Poles are taking to the streets in defense of the country's independent judiciary.
And now the ruling party has its eyes on the Supreme Court.
A set of legislative changes, introduced last week and voted to a parliamentary committee on July 18, provides for an on-the-spot purge of the entire cadre of Poland’s highest appellate panel, which consists of 83 top judges.
The dismissals would take place one day after the law’s promulgation.
The only exceptions are to be made by the minister of justice, also a member of Law and Justice.
The aforementioned National Council of Judiciary, under the influence of the party, will then fill the empty seats.
The revamped Supreme Court would have final appeal powers over all civil and criminal cases.
The bill also provides for the establishment of the new Disciplinary Chamber within the Supreme Court, which will make final determinations on disciplinary actions against all judges in the country.
In a surprise move on July 18, as the bill was being debated, President Andrzej Duda, a former member of Law and Justice party, announced he will not sign the bill regulating the Supreme Court until his new amendments to the National Council of Judiciary bill passed the week before were incorporated.
These amendments provide that the members of the council are to be elected by a three-fifths parliamentary majority, instead of the ordinary majority suggested by the original bill, making it much harder for Law and Justice representatives to elect their candidates.
However, many consider the new law to be unconstitutional and argue that the president's proposal, if adopted, wouldn't change that fact.
In response, the residents of Warsaw and other major Polish cities took to the streets urging the president to veto the bill entirely.
The gatherings were a continuation of demonstrations that began over the weekend and grew more massive on the day the parliament was debating the controversial bill.

A heated discussion in the Parliament lasted almost until midnight, with the opposing minority trying to stop the Supreme Court bill from being passed.
The final vote is expected to take place on July 19.

Used with permission. Wine is not new to activism.
His music has for a while been focused on social justice issues.
But singing about policy issues is not enough.
On 29 June, he finally crossed the line to become a policy maker after securing a parliamentary seat in Kyadondo, winning 75% of the votes in a by-election.
He began singing about social justice in 2005.
Many top musicians took part in the song that Wine refused to take part in.
One of his more popular songs, "Ghetto", talks about police brutality against people residing in the slums of Kampala and the inadequate services that delivered to them.
Wine refers to himself as “The Ghetto President” and “Omubanda Wakabaka,” loosely translated as “The King’s Gang Star”.
He is the fifth person from the country's art fraternity to go into politics, following in the footsteps of Ali Ndawula Wowoto, Sulaiman Madada, Judith Babirye and Kato Lubwama, who now serve as members of parliament.
His campaign was characterized by music, with large numbers of musicians, radio personalities and TV presenters turning up and using their social media accounts to push his message to the electorate, employing the hashtag #BikwaseKyagulanyi, which means "hand over everything to Kyagulanyi".
At his final rally, he was arrested by the police, who alleged that Wine was holding the gathering in a wrong venue close to where President Museveni was campaigning for his candidate.
The video below by NTV Uganda, a local broadcaster, shows him being detained.
He pleads with the police, saying he is fighting for people's rights.
Nevertheless, he won the by-election handily.
He secured 25,659 votes, defeating Sitenda Sebalu, the ruling NRM party candidate, who only received 4,556 votes.
Wine's platform focusing on unemployment and other issues that affect youth, who he believes are misrepresented, captured huge amounts of support.
After he was announced as the winner of the election, he tweeted to his 28,000 followers that something profound has happened in Uganda's electoral politics.
THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN
This 29th day of June marks a turning point in the politics of our country!
Ugandans took to social media to congratulate the 35 year-old celebrated artist on his election into Parliament.
The list of supporters included politicians, musicians and ordinary people on the media platforms.
A few hours before the electoral commission announced the results, NRM Secretary General Justine Lumumba tweeted his message of congratulations:
Congratulations to the people of Kyadondo East, congratulations to @BobiWineOmuband Kyagulanyi Robert Sentamu. — JustineKasuleLumumba (@JustineLumumba) June 29, 2017
And Kizza Besigye, the first runner up in the 2016 presidential campaign, also came out to applauded Bobi Wine's victory; Besigye never campaigned for him as his party had fronted another candidate in the election:
Landslide victory for the HE Bobi Wine.

Fellow artist Jose Chameleone congratulated Bobi Wine on his win:
When we believe, We Achieve.
Congrats to Hon. Robert Kyagulanyi,Family,Friends and Kyadondo East for the remarkable victory .
Leaders are chosen by God.So, May he guide you as you deliver Kyadondo East to the promised Land.
Fellow musicians Radio and Weasel also thanked Bobi Wine for his efforts towards giving the poor a voice through his music and now in politics as well: You Have Brought The Ghetto UpTown.
A famous pop band in Thailand has released a music video parodying the junta that grabbed power in 2014 and continues to govern the country despite its pledge to restore civilian rule.
The Tattoo Colour band’s new song ‘Dictator Girl’ (Phadet Girl) is about a young man narrating the rules set for him by his girl.
While not explicitly about politics, the music video made indirect reference to the continuing military rule.
The band was praised by fans and other Internet users for its bravery in depicting the country’s situation.
The song’s video immediately went viral.
As of this writing, the video uploaded on Facebook has already garnered 1,254 shares and 8,800 likes.
Last month, even a Charlie Chaplin video clip, ‘The Dictator’ was blocked in Thailand after an activist group encouraged the public to watch it.
The video can be interpreted as a creative and fun introduction to Thai politics, especially the country’s situation under Junta rule.
Consider these images in the video that alluded to some of the political issues that have dogged Thailand over the past three years.
The ‘44 rules by girl’ can be referring to the draconian Section 44 of the Interim Constitution which gave the army chief absolute powers to decide on important national issues.
The 11th rule: ‘Adjust your Attitude’, is about the infamous ‘attitude-adjustment’ sessions given by the army to journalists, students, scholars, activists, politicians, and others perceived to be critical of the junta.
The image above reflects the implementation of the Computer Crimes Act whose vague and overbroad provisions are often used by authorities to detain activists and other critics of the state.
An army unit was set up to monitor online content and prosecute individuals accused of defaming the monarchy.
Thailand enforces a strict Lese Majeste (anti-Royal Insult) law.
On May 20, 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.
Two days later, the army staged a coup.
One of the issues hounding the junta is its decision to buy expensive submarines despite security analysts warning the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers’ money.
Even the case of individuals kidnapped and thrown inside a black van before being sent to detention camps was depicted in the video.
Media continues to face serious restrictions; some journalists have been jailed for allegedly causing "confusion" in society, and Internet users face long prison terms if they insult the monarchy.
Meanwhile, the promotional teaser of the song featured members of the band doing the 'Hunger Games' salute which was used by anti-coup activists during protest actions in 2014.

This article was originally published on PesaCheck.org, East Africa’s first fact-checking initiative.
Tanzanian President John Magufuli has called for teen mothers who get pregnant while they are still in school to be banned from returning once they have given birth.
Speaking at a rally in Chalinze, a small town in the eastern region of Pwani, President Magufuli chastised NGOs in Tanzania for encouraging teenage mothers to go back to school, stating that they were "finishing the country" and leading to a state of "moral decay" in Tanzania:
If a girl gets pregnant, if it is deliberate or by accident, gives birth and then returns to school, she will teach these others who haven’t given birth that this is okay.
The same girl can then go again and get pregnant, give birth and go back to school. And again for a third time.
Are we educating parents?
The president added that teen moms attending either primary or secondary school would be banned from going back once they have given birth:
I want to tell them, and those NGOs as well, that during my administration, no girl who has given birth will be allowed to go back to school .
The president went on to say that teen mothers could go elsewhere if they want to get an education, such as the Vocational Educational and Training Authority, or even taking up farming.
The announcement sparked outrage on social media, with Tanzanians using the #ArudiShule (return to school) hashtag to criticize the move, especially considering that over 8,000 Tanzanian girls drop out of school every year due to pregnancy according to a Human Rights Watch report.
So, the question is, do student-mothers influence other students' reproductive behaviour?
PesaCheck has researched the issue, with input from citizen-centered initiative Twaweza, and finds that President Magufuli’s statement is MISLEADING for the following reasons:
Causes of adolescent pregnancies
According to the Tanzania Health and Demographic Survey (THDS) 2015–16 the rate of adolescent pregnancies in mainland Tanzania is considerably high at 27%.
What factors contribute to this figure?
A publication by HakiElimu found citizens opinion on the key contributors to teen pregnancies includes low household income.
The publication states that nearly 31% of the respondents (including parents and teenage girls) thought that poverty was a key factor, with difficult economic situations driving parents to marry off their children as they are not able to meet the basic needs of the female children.
The THDS report also shows that fertility varies with economic levels, decreasing with increasing household wealth.
Wealthier households also have a higher age at first birth, meaning that poorer households are more likely to have younger mothers, most likely of schoolgoing age.
Corroborating this fact, a UNICEF report shows that one in six young women aged 15–19 is married in Tanzania.
These girls get affected psychologically, meaning that many of them are unable to return to school once they drop out.
Another factor in the HakiElimu publication was “poor upbringing and teenage girls own personal desires”.
They found that some parents don’t spend time on their children’s morals and upbringing.
Another finding was the lack of reproductive education which helps teens to fully understand puberty.
“A lot of parents in villages don’t speak to their female children who are going through puberty.”
TDHS 2015 data shows that over half of women already experience sex before the age of 16.
The HakiElimu report also found another contributing factor to be the societal view of a girls child’s value is in being married and being a mother.
The TDHS 2015–16 report shows that fertility rates are strongly related to the level of education. It states that women with no education have 3.3 times more children than women with secondary education.
Adolescent women with no education are 5 times more likely to have begun childbearing compared to those with secondary or higher education.
TDHS 2010 as stated in the UNICEF report (p.12) found that for a majority of the girls who give birth while they are “still children themselves” are in fact not in school.
Are student-mothers key influencers of adolescent pregnancies?
According to the THDS, Zanzibar has a significantly low rate of adolescent pregnancies at 8% compared to mainland Tanzania.
Zanzibar introduced a return to school policy in 2010 as a measure to reduce dropouts.
Kenya is just in between Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar with 18% adolescent pregnancies.
In both these places student mothers are going to school and the adolescent fertility is much lower.
Therefore the statement that student mothers returning to school will influence other students and lead to a rise in teenage pregnancies is MISLEADING.
Most research around adolescent pregnancies attribute teen pregnancies to economic factors and the community attitude and upbringing of female children.

Peace TV network is suspended for one month.
Image from the Southeast Asian Press Alliance, used with permission.
Thailand’s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) has suspended for one month the license of a TV network which has been criticizing the policies of the military-led government.
Signed on August 9, 2017, the NBTC order will take effect once the letter is delivered to the Peace TV network.
Peace TV is affiliated to the United Front Against Dictatorship for Democracy, a group also known as "red shirts" whose prominent leaders are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Some “red shirts” are also known critics of the Lese Majeste (anti-Royal Insult) law, which the government has been using to prosecute activists and anti-junta politicians.
Thailand’s army grabbed power in 2014 and has remained in power through a constitution it drafted.
It vowed to restore civilian rule once political and electoral reforms have been implemented.
Since 2014, the junta has strictly regulated the media and arrested Internet users accused of defaming authorities.
NBTC said Peace TV violated the law when it aired two programs in July that undermined the constitutional monarchy, national security and "good morality."
However, it didn’t specify which parts of the programs have incited the public to oppose the government.
This is the third time that Peace TV has been suspended by the NBTC.
It was previously suspended in April 2015 and July 2016 for allegedly threatening national security.
Some believe Peace TV was suspended because it dared to call former army chief and now Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha a dictator:
#Thailand authorities slap @peacetvnews with 30-day ban for calling #junta leader Gen Prayut "dictator". #censorship pic.twitter.com/32RaKf8wDy — Sunai (@sunaibkk) August 10, 2017
The Southeast Asian Press Alliance questioned the harsh ruling of the NBTC since it will affect all programs and employees of the TV network:
We see the suspension order as too severe, given that the NBTC has identified specific programming on specific dates that it deemed violating Thailand broadcasting laws.
The order punishes the entire station including all programs regardless of content, and all personnel regardless of role.
The group also warned that the NBTC order will lead to the further curtailment of press freedom in Thailand:
Such broad and sweeping powers, especially under a regular law must be used with restraint and proportionality, considering that it can set precedents to be used to potentially infringe on freedom of the press and the public’s right to know and hear all sides of the political discourse in Thai society.
Peace TV officials insisted that the program episodes cited by NBTC didn’t incite the public to rise up against the junta.
They added that during the month-long suspension, Peace TV programs will still be aired through Facebook Live.
They also questioned the timing of the suspension order, which coincided with the August 25 corruption hearing of ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
But Prime Minister Prayut denied that the TV network was suspended in order to silence supportive "red shirt" media during Yingluck’s trial.
He said that it this were the intention of the government, then all media networks should be suspended by NBTC.
Zunar is demanding the police to return 1,187 books and 103 t-shirts which were seized during his arrest last December 17, 2016.

Malaysian cartoonist Zulkiflee S.M. Anwarul Haque, more popularly known as Zunar, has filed a case against the police for arresting him and seizing his cartoon books and t-shirts on December 17, 2016.
Zunar accused the police of making an unlawful arrest and confiscating a total of 1,187 books and 103 t-shirts during an event which he organized to meet his fans and raise funds.
He explains his reason for taking legal action:
My books are not banned and I was only selling them to my fans during the fundraising event.
What is wrong with that?
Zunar has been arrested several times in the past few years and charged with sedition for his cartoons that criticize government policies, abuse of power by the ruling coalition that has dominated Malaysia’s politics since the 1950s, and curtailment of civil liberties.
Many of Zunar’s cartoon books have also been confiscated by authorities for allegedly threatening national security.
Zunar has won recognition in and outside Malaysia as a press freedom fighter.
He has won accolades from Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Cartoonist Rights Network International.
His December arrest was tied to a police investigation of him under Section 124C of the Penal Code for “activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy.”
He was interrogated for six hours and released after the police told him that “they will apply a law to ban all my books.”
He issued this statement shortly after his release:
I would like to point out my stand: talent is not a gift, but a responsibility.
It is my responsibility as a cartoonist to expose corruption and injustices.
Do I fear jail?
Yes, but responsibility is bigger that fear.
You can ban my books, you can ban my cartoons, but you cannot ban my mind.
I will keep drawing until the last drop of my ink.
Zunar could be referring to the corruption scandal involving the prime minister and 1MDB, a state-owned investment firm.
The prime minister is accused of pocketing 680 million US dollars through alleged anomalous transactions made by 1MDB.
Zunar’s lawyer, N. Surendran, said the filing of the case against the police is intended to warn authorities about making another illegal arrest:
There will be no more tolerance for this kind of unlawful behaviour against a person whose only crime is to criticise the authorities.
That is the democratic right of every Malaysian.
Zunar is demanding the police to return his books and t-shirts.
On the left, one refugee asks, “Are you sure we can really eat as much as we want?”
On the right, the other female defector says, “All the food in this restaurant is rotten."
South Koreans use the English word “buffet," which sounds like the Korean word for “rotten."
A challenge for many North Korean defectors is to learn all of these borrowed foreign words that have become part of the southern vernacular.

This story by Jason Strother originally appeared on PRI.org on July 6, 2017.
It is republished here as part of a partnership between PRI and Global Voices.
The escape of around 30,000 North Korean defectors to South Korea might not seem like a storyline rife with laughter.
But an online comic strip series created by a North Korean refugee, who now lives in Seoul, attempts to bring some humor to what is an often-harrowing journey and difficult resettlement.
After his own defection to South Korea in 2010, Choi Seong-guk, 37, realized that the two Koreas were no longer the same country — many cultural and linguistic differences have arisen during more than 70 years of division.
For Choi, who had once worked for Pyongyang’s premier animation studio, SEK, one of the first differences that stood out was that cartoons in the south weren’t anything like the ones in the north.
“When I first saw South Korean cartoons, I just didn’t get them,” he says.
“There were no stories about patriotism or catching spies or war.
They just seemed useless to me.”
Choi has had a knack for drawing since he was a kid, when teachers praised him for his sketches of evil American soldiers that he says he made look “as ugly and violent as possible.”
This is a re-creation of a drawing Choi made as a young student.
It depicts an American soldier kicking a South Korean soldier as they prepare to cross the border into North Korea.
The caption reads, "Invasion from the South." Credit: Choi Seong-guk
In 2016, Choi returned to drawing and began an online comic strip series called "Rodong Shimmun," which means "labor interrogation" — it’s a play on the name of North Korea’s "Rodong Shinmun," the labor newspaper.
The satirical series follows a group of newly arrived refugees as they spend their first months in South Korea at a government–run integration center.
Choi pokes fun at their 'newbie-ness,' like their shock about all the food at a buffet restaurant.
He also tells the story of one lovelorn defector, which he says is based on his own embarrassing cultural misunderstanding.
The defector meets a South Korean woman, who says, “Interesting.
I’ve never met a North Korean person before.
Can I have your phone number?”
Credit: Choi Seong-guk
“One time I met a South Korean woman who asked for my phone number and said she wanted to become my friend,” he recalls.
“I somehow misinterpreted that as she wanted to marry me.”
The woman goes on to use a term of endearment that’s casually spoken in South Korea.
In a subsequent text bubble, Choi explains to his readers how this caused mixed signals.
“In North Korea only romantic partners would say that to each other. Amongst friends, we just call each other 'comrade.'”
Not all of Choi’s drawings are funny, though.
Some depict scenes in North Korea of people starving in the streets.
Throughout Choi’s comic series are glimpses of life in North Korea.
In this drawing, the person says, "Hey, you could die.
We should eat this grass.”

Others portray how some defectors made their escape under fire from border guards.
Choi says he hopes his comic series will help change the mindset of South Koreans, who are generally apathetic toward North Korean refugees.
The caption above the drawing reads: “Escaping North Korea is all about survival.
Even if one of your family members get shot and falls down, you just have to keep running."

"Rodong Shimmun" now receives tens of thousands of views and some readers leave comments saying it’s helped them better understand the cultural differences between North and South Korea.
Others write that they feel more empathetic toward defectors.
From left to right: Pravit Rojanaphruk, Watana Muangsook, and Pichai Naripthaphan.
In the past week, three Facebook users in Thailand were charged with sedition over posts criticizing the military-led government.
Veteran journalist Pravit Rojanaphruk, Watana Muangsook of the Pheu Thai political party, and former energy minister Pichai Naripthaphan were informed by the police about the sedition charges.
The military grabbed power in 2014 and continues to rule the country through a Constitution it passed in 2016. Aside from strictly regulating the media, it has been aggressively prosecuting individuals accused of either insulting the monarchy or criticizing the junta.
Thailand implements a Lese Majeste (anti-Royal Insult) law, which critics believe is being abused by the army to silence dissident voices.
Pravit, a senior reporter for the news website Khaosod English, wrote on August 1, 2017 about how he learned of his sedition case:
I received a call from the Deputy Superintendent of the Technology Crime Suppression Division informing me at about 6.40pm that a police of the rank of Police Lieutenant Colonel is charging me of violating sedition law through an estimate 5 Facebook postings.
I insist that I criticize the military regime in good faith I will continue to criticize the illegitimate military regime until they take away my smartphone.
The police didn’t inform him which of the Facebook posts he wrote have been deemed seditious by the government.
Pravit was previously ‘invited’ by the army to undergo an ‘attitude-adjustment’ session.
This unusual detention is the army’s way of dealing with perceived critics in the media and academe.
If found guilty, Pravit can be detained for up to 20 years.
Correction: Aft consulting @TLHR2014 again, possible maximum imprisonment term is 20 not 60 yrs.
Pichai, meanwhile, served under the former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who is currently facing a corruption case.
According to Khaosod English, Pichai posted the following status update on Facebook, which he claimed he wrote with ‘sincere intentions’:
If the government does not solve it in time, the economic situation will keep deteriorating, like a frog in a pot that gradually boils.
I hope the Thai government and Thai people will realize this in time, and be the frog that leaps out before the water boils.
Watana is another member of the Yingluck admnistration who is accused by the police of misleading the public about the justice system and the military-led government through a post he uploaded on Facebook.
Both Pichai and Watana were members of the ruling party before the military staged a coup in 2014.
The two politicians were charged in the same week that Yingluck faced the court on corruption charges related to a rice subsidy scheme, prompting some to wonder whether the charges are meant to silence Yingluck's supporters.
News about the filing of sedition cases against junta critics prompted some Twitter users to comment about the restriction of free speech in the country:
One tweet mentioned Prayut, the former army chief who led the 2014 coup and is now the country's prime minister:

On August 8, millions of Kenyans will cast their vote in what is expected to be the most competitive general elections to date.
Ballots will be cast for 290 members of parliament, 47 female county representatives, 47 senators and governors, as well as the president.
The presidential vote will be a rematch of the 2013 poll that pit incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta against his ex-rival, former prime minister Raila Odinga.
By any measure, this election is expected to be the closest contest to date between Kenyatta and Odinga, raising the political and economic stakes for the country.
As Kenya is the undisputed economic anchor of the region, the smooth execution of the August 8 elections will be critical for wider East Africa.
Kenya remains one of the largest and most vibrant economies on the continent and any sign of political and/or economic volatility will be felt well beyond its own borders.
There is evidence from the past to suggest that fears of post-election instability have impacted the country's economy.
No matter who wins, it is likely that the candidates will challenge the results of what analysts are already calling the most expensive election in Africa.
Any such challenge will have the worrying effect of eroding public confidence in the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the judiciary, the two institutions responsible for safeguarding electoral integrity.
Public trust in these institutions last hit a low in 2007, and the bloody aftermath of that year’s elections stands as a stark reminder of what could transpire when people lose faith in the integrity of these institutions.
In the 2013 election, when Kenya avoided a repeat of 2007-08 and held relatively peaceful elections, East Africa heaved a collective sigh of relief that reverberated throughout the continent and many other parts of the world.
This was due in part to the electoral cycle: political tension tends to rise when incumbents are defending their seats, and in 2013 incumbent president Mwai Kibaki had already served two terms and wasn’t eligible for re-election.
By then public confidence in the IEBC and the judiciary had also improved compared to the previous election.
This time around, however, the odds appear once again stacked against the smooth running of the polls.
Firstly, Kenyatta wants to get re-elected, so he will be seeking to use all the resources at his disposal to retain power.
More critically, public confidence in the electoral commission and the judiciary is once again falling, to levels reminiscent of those in 2007.
Both institutions have come under attack from both the opposition, which has been critical of the IEBC, and the government, which has directed its criticism at the courts.
Some of the latter has come directly from President Kenyatta towards the judiciary.
These developments have the stage for potential challenges to the election results.
Key factors to watch
The Electoral commission: The IEBC has been since the beginning of the year, with allegations levelled against it that include legal breaches, logistical inefficiencies, and transparency issues surrounding its procurement process.
There are also concerns over the IEBC’s preparedness to conduct and execute on election day without any major glitches.
Managing elections for president, governors, senators and county representatives is a logistical challenge under normal circumstances, but given the delays in staffing senior leadership positions and procurement issues that plague the organization, the credibility and reputational stakes for the Commission have undoubtedly increased.
The high probability of close elections both at the county and presidential levels makes matters are even more complex.
There is a risk that neither Odinga nor Kenyatta will secure the necessary 50% +1 of votes cast, thus triggering a second-round vote.
This would be unprecedented and would be arriving at a time when political and social pressures are high, further exerting undue pressure on the IEBC.
Leaving the presidential election aside, it is also possible that certain gubernatorial and other local elections might not result in a definitive winner.
Will the IEBC be able to hold it all together?
The Economy: Although ethnic divisions are typically the focal point of Kenyan elections, this year concerns about the economy are taking centre stage.
Inflation is on the rise, led by food prices, reaching a peak of 21% year-on-year in April.
This pushed headline inflation to a five-year high of 11.5% in April 2017, up from 10.3% in March.
The rise in food prices is primarily the result of drought in some parts of the country, which drove up the prices of staple commodities such as maize, sugar and vegetables, and in some cases has led to shortages.
Criticism of the government’s handling of the situation may, in fact, translate into a protest vote against the government at the polls.
Security: One important similarity between the 2017 and 2013 election environments is the absence of either terrorism and the militant group al-Shabaab or the fact that Kenya remains at war in Somalia as a campaign issue.
It only took a few months after the elections in 2013 for al-Shabaab to make its presence known with the horrific events at the Westgate Shopping Centre that left 67 people dead. But terrorism and insecurity remain a constant threat in Kenya, and groups like al-Shabaab and others may look to undermine and influence the election outcome in the weeks leading up to August 8, or even in the days after.
Post-election environment remains uncertain
Assuming all goes well after the polls, whether the presidency is occupied by Kenyatta or Odinga, more problems are looming – particularly on the economic front: Kenya has mounting debts. Starting the end of this calendar year to 2019, fiscal resources are expected to come under pressure due to external debt servicing.
For example, in December, a $750 million commercial loan, secured in October 2015, will be due.
This will be followed by the expected repayment in June 2018 of a $600 million loan from the African Export-Import Bank, earlier secured to support cash-strapped Kenya Airways.
Furthermore, in 2019, the five-year $750 million Eurobond, issued in 2014, will fall due in December, as well as a portion of another $800 million syndicated loan granted by commercial banks, including Citigroup, Standard Bank, Standard Chartered and Rand Merchant Bank.
These payments are expected to result in external debt servicing rising by a whopping 242%, from $424 million to $1.4 billion in the 2017-18 budget. These repayments are all expected to happen against the backdrop of a weaker Kenyan shilling and a stronger US dollar, which majority of Kenya’s external debts are denominated in.
Needless to say, the new president may not have much time to bask in the glory of his victory.

On June 29, 2017, Jamaica's first female prime minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, made her final speech in parliament.
It marked, at the age of 72, her retirement from representational politics.
Simpson-Miller had been under some pressure to step down as opposition leader ever since the People's National Party (PNP), under her leadership, lost the general elections in February 2016.
Former finance minister, Peter Phillips, was returned unopposed as party leader, and sworn in as opposition leader on April 3, 2017.
Ms. Simpson Miller was showered with tributes by colleagues on both sides of the house in a joint sitting of parliament on June 27, where she was described as a champion of the poor.
With rural roots, her political journey as a woman and her personal resilience in the face of stiff challenges were often topics of praise and admiration.
However, her leadership skills were often called into question during her two stints as prime minister, and as she left the political stage she still had her detractors.
Outspoken entertainer Tanya Stephens took to Facebook to deliver a devastating critique of Simpson-Miller's legacy:
Hearing people lament Portia's departure is like seeing people congratulate my rapist for being a 'good man'...she isn't a good person.
SHE knows that.
Besides unqualified AND an embarrassing representation who wasn't even of average intelligence as per her public displays, she was also an awful apathetic human who perfected the art of pandering to the hypocrisy of Jamaicans.
I'm happy to see her back.
I'm not alone.
Good riddance.
Stephens responded to the many Jamaicans who were disturbed by her outburst by simply stating:
That it takes 'audacity' to criticize a PUBLIC SERVANT is a tragedy.
As a quite unpleasant war of words ensued, community activist Damien Williams shared:
To compare the fanfare & well wishes towards PSM to that being offered to a rapist is NOT a critique of her capacity, competence or a commentary on her failures but NASTY personal attack, plain and simple.
However, to offer a defense of PSM by doing same is equally nasty.
Rape is NEVER something you downplay or use to inflict pain/recompense.
We certainly can express dissent without ad hominem.
We are always so grotesquely excessive and then use as a crutch, freedom of speech.

Affectionately known as "Mama P," Simpson-Miller presided over the gritty "garrison" constituency of South West St. Andrew for over four decades.
It is an inner city area of the capital, plagued with poor infrastructure, unemployment and poverty.
Columnist Martin Henry wrote:
Portia Simpson came to representational politics at the parliamentary level in 1976 when political tribalism and its ugly pickney, political violence, were on the upswing.
The state of emergency declared by the Government that year, partly in response to escalating violence associated with the election campaign, assisted the young KSAC councillor to capture what up till then was a safe JLP seat, having never been won before by the PNP since its creation in 1959.
Her 76 per cent margin of victory in '76 just kept growing to the point where it equalled the number of voters, even when a few voted for the JLP candidate.
Since 1976, criminal violence, indexed by murder, has progressively increased, with South West Andrew making its above-average contribution.
Within a week or two of Simpson-Miller's resignation as a member of parliament, the party became gradually embroiled in a political tussle over her possible successor in the constituency.
This was reported and commented on in detail by both traditional and social media.
Jamaicans have a taste for political intrigue, and many (especially those with party affiliations) are following every twist and turn with interest.
Blake, who has recovered, is reportedly no longer interested in contesting the seat.
While Councillor Audrey Smith-Facey, who is campaigning under the hashtag #OurAudrey, was expected to be the main contender, the waters were muddied considerably when a video was posted of Simpson Miller endorsing former Kingston mayor, Councillor Angela Brown-Burke, to succeed her.
This was a surprise to many, with some questioning whether it was genuine, having come after the nomination period had ended; this threw the party into further confusion.
According to one news report, however, party delegates are firmly rejecting Brown-Burke.
Many would like to see the young maverick, Damion Crawford, in the seat.
Crawford is apparently not interested, but this has not stopped him from seeing the humour in the situation (he locked horns with Brown Burke on social media in 2015): UPDATE: the PNP's @DamionCrawford cites campaign slogan for #AudreySmithFacey & appears to take a jab at former Kgn Mayor Angela @brownburke pic.twitter.com/s70KuGP0Li — Abka Fitz-Henley (@AbkaFitzHenley) July 22, 2017

Meanwhile, some journalists are enjoying the cut and thrust within the party:

#OurAudrey shows no sign of backing down, issuing a somewhat sarcastic statement that she expects to be the "standard bearer".
One Jamaican Twitter user was amused:
Loooooooooooooooooooooool.
Is which lawyer/PR person write this?
Them need to raise them retainer.
This was good. https://t.co/jzi7f2banO — #Cariblue (@ja_cynic) July 20, 2017
Not to be outdone, Councillor Brown-Burke is busy campaigning on her Facebook page, with a photo of herself and "her people" in the constituency.
She also wasted no time in updating the cover photo on her Facebook page to read, "I'm thankful for my struggle, because without it I wouldn't have stumbled across my strength!"
After a meeting of the party's executive council, the PNP has now agreed to hold a selection conference to decide between the two women on July 30, 2017.
The question remains, though: does Portia Simpson-Miller want to remain engaged with the people of South West St. Andrew, whom she described in her farewell speech as her “armour of steel"?
Perhaps that depends on which woman succeeds her.
Tep Vanny's supporters calling for her release.
Photo from LICADHO, a human rights group in Cambodia.
At least 65 civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs) from across the world have already signed a unity statement urging the Cambodian government to release land rights activist Tep Vanny, who has been in detention for the past 12 months.
Tep Vanny is a prominent human rights activist who has been campaigning on behalf of marginalized farmers and displaced small landholders in Cambodia.
She was arrested last August 2016 for leading the ‘Black Monday’ protest which was organized to call for the release of five human rights defenders accused of interfering in a government case involving an opposition leader.
The court convicted Tep Vanny of “insulting a public official” and sentenced her to six days in prison.
But during her detention, the government revived a 2013 case against her when she led a protest in front of the prime minister’s house over the eviction of Boeung Kak Lake residents.
A government reclamation project in Boeung Kak Lake, located in the capital city of Phnom Penh, has displaced thousands of residents living around the area.
On February 23, 2017, Tep Vanny was found guilty of committing “intentional violence with aggravating circumstances” during the 2013 protest, and she received a prison sentence of two years and six months.
On August 8, 2017, the court affirmed the decision to convict Tep Vanny.
It was also reported that Tep Vanny could face a third trial for another revived case related to a 2011 protest in a Boeung Kak Lake community.
“Even though I am in jail, I am handcuffed and I am wearing prison uniform, the reality is that I am forever innocent.” #FreeTepVanny https://t.co/PCXixwZSFR — Lorenzo Urbinati (@LorUrb) August 15, 2017
Tep Vanny’s prolonged detention is seen by some activists as part of a government plan to silence the opposition and spread fear among the people in time for the 2018 general elections.
Cambodia’s ruling party has been in power for the past three decades, but it lost a significant number of seats in the 2013 elections.
The joint statement signed by 65 CSOs and NGOs warned that Tep Vanny’s detention “contributes to creating an atmosphere of fear for human rights defenders throughout Cambodia.”
It also emphasized that dissent and peaceful activism should not be criminalized:
As a result of her imprisonment, Tep Vanny is prevented from carrying out her peaceful and valuable work as a woman human rights defender.
Peaceful protest and expressions of dissent are not a crime, and human rights defenders should not be penalized for the exercise of their human rights.
The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development noted that Tep Vanny’s trial violated international norms:
The fabricated charges against Tep Vanny and her arbitrary detention are politically motivated attempts to silence and restrict her activism as a human rights defender.
The trial itself did not meet international standards for a fair trial.
Aside from local human rights groups, activists and residents in Boeung Kak Lake have been petitioning the offices of UN agencies and various embassies in Cambodia to seek help in pressuring the Cambodian government to release Tep Vanny.
Cambodian social media users are also encouraged to replace their profile photos with icons of the campaign.
A table showing the new Kazakh alphabet, as published on the presidential website.
A website in Kazakhstan is showing users how their names will look in a new Latin alphabet expected to come into force by 2022.
Many have reacted with dismay after finding their names laced with apostrophes.
As an article in the Economist explained, there were reasons for avoiding other, less punctuated versions of the Latin alphabet, such as the one initially floated: Delighted critics pointed out that the rendering of the Kazakh word for carrot in that alphabet would have been saebiz, which looks a bit like a transliteration of the Russian for “f**k off”.
The Russian government-run outlet Sputnik noted that even in the latest iteration, there are plenty of words that might look rude to people with a knowledge of Russian.
Such quirks are perhaps inevitable, and Cyrillic will still be the alphabet of choice for millions of Russian-speakers across the country.
But the issue of apostrophe proliferation in Kazakh remains pertinent.
So Nazarbayev said it’s time to accept latest version of Latin KZ alphabet.
To get an idea of what is bothering Kazakhs, Global Voices ran ourselves through the Latin-Cyrillic-Kazakh Latin alphabet treadmill to see how we looked when we came out the other side.
The methodology is simple.
First imagine how your current name would have appeared on a birth certificate if you had been born in Kazakhstan, which was part of the Soviet Union before 1991.
To do this, use a Latin to Cyrillic converter such as the one available on the Lexilogos "multilingual keyboard".
Then use the Cyrillic to Kazakh Latin converter in order to find out how many apostrophes your name collects.
Juan Tadeo, our authority on all things Mexico would be Хуан Тадео in Cyrillic.
But in Kazakh Latin his name becomes Hy'an Tadeo, a single apostrophe effort with a somewhat Chinese flavour.
The apostrophes begin to really take over when Global Voices Managing Director Georgia Popplewell, or Djordji'i'a Poppely'ell gets involved.
And they go through the roof for our Uganda hand Prudence Nyamishana (Pry'dence Ni'ami's'ana). Curiously, however, our Global Voices Lingua director Mohamed ElGohary comes through the Alphabet Soup completely unscathed.
It seems he is our translations chief for a reason...
Murdered Mexican Journalist Cándido Ríos: 'Our Weapons Do Not Shoot Bullets.
Cándido Ríos Vázquez.
Photo widely shared in Twitter.
Mexican journalist Cándido Ríos, also known by locals and colleagues as “Pavuche,” was murdered on August 22, 2017, in a gun attack in Hueyapan de Ocampo, Veracruz, on Mexico's east coast, according to local sources.
Independent news outlet Animal Político gave more details about his death:
Ríos, known as "Pavuche" among his colleagues, died while being transported to the hospital after having been wounded with a firearm of high caliber, sources familiar with the case told AFP.
Ríos' name joins the list of journalists who have been murdered in Mexico this year, which includes Salvador Adame, Miroslava Breach and Javier Valdez.
According to freedom of expression advocacy group Article 19, Ríos is the ninth journalist assassinated in the country in 2017.
Ríos was the founder of the weekly newspaper La Voz de Hueyapan and had reported for local newspaper Diario Acayucan for over 10 years.
His work included coverage of corruption and police.
Animal Político pointed out:
The journalist was known for his career as a crime reporter and for having conflicts with some former town mayors in the region due to his work.
Here’s to remember Cándido Ríos: "Our weapons don't shoot bullets, they shoot truth."
Journalist who was shot to death in Veracruz.
Shockingly, Ríos was under the local authorities' protection after he had received threats to his life over to his journalistic work.
Newspaper La Jornada reported:
Jorge Morales, from the State’s Commission to Serve and Protect Journalists, reported that Cándido Ríos had filed several complaints against some of the region's political figures for aggressions against his person.
News site Huffington Post elaborated:
His tireless efforts to denounce injustice brought him popularity among readers, but also enemies like the former mayor of Ríos' hometown Hueyapan, who threatened him with death several times, said his former colleague Cecilio Perez, director of Diario de Acayucan.
Meanwhile, news portal MX Politico shared his picture on Twitter:
Cándido Ríos, the journalist who was murdered in Veracruz, warned everyone that he was going to be assassinated
Traditional media outlets in the country have provided minimal coverage to Ríos’ murder.
Some have published different versions about the reasons behind his assassination.
Online national news outlet Milenio highlighted a comment from a Mexican government official who stated that Ríos was not the target of the attack in which he died:
Journalist Cándido Ríos Vázquez was not the target of the attack in which he and two other people died at a gas station in Hueyapan de Ocampo, Veracruz, said Roberto Campa Cifrian, deputy secretary of the Human Rights of Secretariat of the Interior.
Jaqueline Dorantes shared the following message among her followers:
Cándido Ríos was the only journalist in Hueyapan

What Happens at Maekelawi?
All members of Zone9 in Addis Ababa, 2012.
From left to right: Natnael, Abel, Befeqadu, Mahlet, Zelalem and Atnaf.
This week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced that Maekelawi, one of the country's most famous detention centers, will soon close.
This brought a mix of emotions to the many Ethiopians who have survived the notoriously brutal interrogation practices used at Maekelawi.
Among them is Global Voices author and human rights blogger Befeqadu Hailu.
In 2014, Befeqadu was arrested along with eight of his blogger and journalist colleagues, all due to their participation in a collective blog known as Zone9, where they wrote about their government's obligations to human rights and constitutional law.
The nine writers were detained and held in Maekelawi without charge for nearly twelve weeks in 2014, before being charged under the country's Anti-Terrorism Proclamation.
Befeqadu later wrote a first-hand account of his experience in the detention center, which we share here in an effort to shed light on the harsh reality of Maekelawi under Ethiopia's current government.
In an August 2014 letter delivered to Global Voices by the bloggers' lawyers, Befeqadu wrote:
The idea of setting a foot in the compound of the ill-famed Maekelawi detention center gives a cold shiver to anyone who knows its history.
But my sheer optimism and trust that the brutal and inhumane treatment of people was a distant memory saved me from trembling as I was escorted into the compound.
The same was true of my friends, I suppose.
What is more, we had nothing to be scared of, because we are neither undercover agents nor members of armed forces.
We are just writers.
But as soon as I arrived at Maekelawi, detainees informed me that I had been placed in one of the notorious sections of the detention center, known as “Siberia”.
In less than a week, I felt like I was living in the middle of an account from the 2013 Human Rights Watch report entitled “They Want a Confession”.
“They Want a Confession” documents serious human rights abuses, unlawful interrogation tactics, and poor detention conditions in Addis Ababa’s Maekelawi detention center, drawing from interviews with former Maekelawi detainees and their family members. Those detained in Maekelawi include scores of opposition politicians, journalists, protest organizers, and alleged supporters of ethnic insurgencies.
Befeqadu described the interrogation methods at Maekelawi as being "more about dominance and submission than confidence or creativity."
"If they cannot successfully extract information from you in this way, they force confessions by punching, beating, extended physical exercise and flogging," he wrote.
"I spoke with some detainees who had undergone even more wicked procedures that were clear violations of their privacy.
Some detainees were forced to strip naked and asked to stand or perform sit-ups until dawn."
He continued, describing how he and his colleagues were forced to confess:
In our case, finally we were made to plead guilty.
We confessed under duress.
We could not bear the ceaseless brutal and psychologically degrading pressure.
We could not carry on surviving the hell of Maeklawi. We ended up telling our interrogators what they wanted to hear.
To their delight, we added as many self-incriminating phrases as possible.
But phrases like “yes, we wanted to incite violence” never pleased them.
So they rewrote our confessions to fit their frame.
Some of us tried to explain. Others had to endure beatings.
But at last we succumbed to the pressure and signed the carefully scripted confession pages, with the exception of our colleague Abel, who refused to sign at that time.
He has survived the pain he has endured since, and his confession, when finally extracted, is completely untrue, to say nothing of ours.
Now we know that torture is the part of the Maekelawi ceremony that reveals the “truth” of a crime.
I had long thought police interrogations were complex, involving sophisticated skills, knowledge and psychological tactics to establish facts.
I now know that police interrogations in Maekelawi are not so elaborate.
In fact they are simple.
They are like machines that produce guilt in the detainees.
At Maekelawi, the driving principle of police interrogations is that you are guilty unless proven otherwise.
Your pleas for innocence – or even for explanation – fall on deaf ears.
Befeqadu spent 18 months detained in Ethiopian prisons along his colleagues before they walked free in October 2015.
He and his colleagues were acquitted without ever testifying in court.
Zone9 members rejoiced at the release of Befeqadu Hailu (second from left, in scarf) in October 2015.
Befeqadu also described accounts he had heard from fellow prisoners, who had been brought to Maekelawi after suffering through even worse ordeals at other detention centers in the country.
"These detainees suffered from diabolical barbarity such as forcible extraction of their nails from their fingers, flogging, and hooding," he wrote.
The information extracted from detainees in the unnamed detention center is then verified through more interrogation at the pre-trial detention center. Detainees never know where they were taken for this brutal investigation because they are hooded throughout.
The unnamed detention centers are like black holes.
Referencing human rights violations under Derg regime, which Ethiopia's current government is now seeking to distance itself from, Befeqadu compared these experiences to those of the past.
"It turns out that the anguish of Ethiopian prisoners, something that appeared to be so distant in memory, is not that far off after all," he said.
Responding to this week's news, Befeqadu wrote on Twitter:
PM Hailemariam said, "Maekelawi was a torture house in Derg regime"; it is disappointing.
I'm a living victim of that torture chamber under his rule.
Back then, I wished to commit sucide instead of seeing interrogators the next day.
These guys make it difficult to forgive. — BefeQadu Z. Hailu (@befeqe) January 3, 2018
Befeqadu and two of his colleagues Atnaf and Natnael are not really free, in the purest sense of the word.
Although their terrorism charges were reversed, they are awaiting decisions on other charges, all of which have been triggered by their peaceful criticism of the ruling government.

To all those who will inhabit the places we left….
We once had a revolution there.
I never resided in those neighborhoods, but was a visitor, a stranger, with all my little rituals, such as greeting the neighbor on the staircase in the morning, my frantic searches for products that were not customarily sold there, my long, obsessive conversations with taxi drivers in order to gauge their political leanings and their views on checkpoints.
We still have a revolution there, in Bustan Al Qasr.
There you will see—unless the Barbarians have erased it—a childish sketch of a soldier and a bearded man with a hammer above them and the phrase: “a revolution that will crack heads”.
This marked the beginning of our second revolution, one against those trying to confiscate our rights by force of weapon or religion.
But you probably don’t know about the many revolutions we have had there, painted by Abu Maryam.
You would probably not hear our voices as we tell you who Abu Maryam is.
We have a revolution there.
They were protesting to open the checkpoint for civilians.
We have a revolution there.
We have a revolution there.
The closest of whom to me was Mustafa.
We opened a school there that held his name.
It is there too.
The school gave us a reason to go on; we believed we were paying our debts.
Mustafa’s grave and his school are yours now.
If you ever pass by them, treat them with dignity, for this man was a wellspring of love, giving and devotion.
We were part of his vision, and we failed.
We have a revolution there.
We often laughed at his faulty grammar.
And when the outbreak of Leishmania occurred, and some of us carried out spraying campaigns, we had our own graffiti which said: “Leishmania over”.
That was how we adapted, that was how we looked for solutions.
That is why you will find our schools and our hospitals in basements.
We were adapting to the bombings.
We were trying to resist.
We had a revolution there….
The Eye Hospital!
There we protested over and over against Sharia Courts.
There, ISIS murdered 35 of us.
There, our protests erupted to expel them.
There I was jailed—don’t swear yet—for there was also where I was released, because we have a revolution there.
Turn it back into a hospital.
Not like our underground hospitals, but one for all people.
The place is teeming with spirits that will look after the ill.
Old Aleppo was our resting place.
There I used to go to sing; we the evil terrorists loved to sing, to love, to cook and at “Falafel House” to eat everything but falafel.
You would be amazed at the piles of rocks.
These were the houses of families, houses that were probably all they had.
They were forced to leave.
Take some time to shed a tear in memory of their memories.
You would not recognize it.
I used to leave for months, but could never get used to the magnitude of the destruction whenever I came back.
That was what your neighbors faced, so shedding some tears would do no harm.
You would find, if they allowed, countless bodies under the rubble.
It was not our intention to leave our bodies like that without a proper burial.
It wasn’t that we were negligent, but the jets were targeting all groups, and it became impossible in the last months to move the vehicles.
Give them, if you’re ever allowed, a proper burial.
You will not be allowed to find out their names, for sure, but please don’t just give them random numbers.
Use your imagination and bury them together.
Syrian families have been scattered enough, and nobody likes to be buried alone.
We have a revolution there.
Curse it, or mourn it.
It is there, in the rocks, in the graves, in the earth and above in the air.
On the wall of a graveyard we once wrote: “We are alive, we will keep going, and the dream will be realized”.
Take whatever is left of us and keep on dreaming.
Soon everything else of yours will be confiscated.

You might stumble upon a news bulletin stream from Tonga; a traditional tune that's soothing its Iranian audience into slumber during the late hours of the night; or one of the few radio stations that continue to fill the airwaves in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Click on the "History" option on Radio Garden to be transported to an important part of a country's radio broadcasting history.
Other noteworthy features include a "History" function which showcases a country's traditional music and historic broadcasts; a "Jingles" section that, as its name suggests, offers a glimpse of a city's iconic radio jingles; and a "Story" option that offers first-hand accounts of people's involvement with community radio.
Once again, all of these will take you to a different part of the world, be it the Taiwanese capital of Taipei or the down-under metropolis that is Sydney, Australia.
Here's a YouTube video that showcases the Radio.Garden in action:
The initiative was masterminded by the Institute for Sound and Vision in the Netherlands, under the direction of Golo Föllmer of the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.
It relied on the expertise of two local design companies, Studio Puckey and Moniker, who decided that the best way to tackle the task was to create a comprehensive map without borders or city names.
When it originally launch, Radio Garden garnered widespread attention on social media.
One of its designers, Jonathan Puckey, told The Guardian he was pleasantly surprised by the discussions he had seen about this project:
On Reddit, it prompted a really sweet discussion, with people talking about their first contact with radio, or grandparents who had worked in radio during the second world war.
The project's own Facebook page is also filled with words of encouragement and support, with users from all walks of life giving it rave reviews.
Aside from the website, Radio Garden has an app for iOS and Android devices, enabling users to listen to their selected broadcasts at their convenience – even if their smartphones drop into sleep/idle mode.

Blogging has been popular in Tanzania for more than a decade, enabling writers and independent journalists to express views and report news that might not otherwise appear in mainstream media.
But as of last month, this kind of work will come with a price tag.
On March 16, 2018, the United Republic of Tanzania issued the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations demanding that bloggers must register and pay over USD $900 per year to publish online.
Application 2. These Regulations shall apply to online content including: (a) application services licensees; (b) bloggers; (c) internet cafes; (d) online content hosts; (e) online forums; (f) online radio or television; (g) social media; (h) subscribers and users of online content; and (i) any other related online content.
The new regulations have far-reaching implications for freedom of expression and human rights.
Bloggers must fill out official regulatory forms and avoid publishing prohibited content including nudity, hate speech, explicit sex acts, extreme violence, "content that causes annoyance", fake news, and "bad language" among other restrictions.
The new regulations grant unrestrained power to the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to prescribe and proscribe.
Under Part II, Number 4, TCRA then has the authority:
(a) to keep register of bloggers, online forums, online radio and online television; (b) to take action against non-compliance to these Regulations, including to order removal of prohibited content
iAfrikan News further explains:
Online content publishers (blogs, podcasts, videos) will apply for a license at a fee of 100,000 Tanzanian Shillings (44 USD) pay an initial license fee of 1,000,000 Tanzanian Shillings (440 USD) and an annual license fee of 1,000,000 Tanzanian Shillings (440 USD).
This means to run something as simple as a personal blog (text) if you live in Tanzania, you’d have to spend an initial (approximately) $900 (USD) in license fees.
One immediate public concern regarding the new regulations is their ambiguity.
In his latest post, blogger Ben Taylor analyzed the content of the regulations, taking note of a lack of clear definitions:
The first thing to note is that these regulations are very unclear on several important points.
Some terms – such as 'online content provider' and 'online content service provider' – are never defined.
Are these the same thing?
In other places, the title given to a section of the regulations bears no relation to its content – section 7, for example, has 'bloggers' in the title but nothing relevant to bloggers in the content.
There are spelling and grammatical errors throughout.
And perhaps most bizarrely, the main section on applications for online content service licenses – section 14 – doesn’t even require that applicants must submit their application – only that they must 'fill in an application form' – or say where it should be submitted.
Taylor raises essential questions throughout his analysis.
No one yet knows how these regulations will be interpreted by the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA), the police or the courts.
What is clear is that breaches of the new law will be punishable with a fine of "not less than five million Tanzanian shillings” (around USD $2,500), or imprisonment for “not less than 12 months or both."
The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA) issued a policy brief on the new regulation, warning against its ambiguity in certain sections:
... regulations should be reviewed and amended to have clear, unambiguous definitions and wording, and quash the requirement for registration of bloggers and users of similar online platforms.
It is also essential that not too much power is vested in TCRA with regards to content take-downs and that diversity in content availability online is promoted.
The obligations set out should not turn content service providers and publishers into monitors, by handing them responsibility such as use of moderating tools to filter content, conducting content review before publication, and undertaking mechanisms to identify sources of content.
Blogging as alternative news in Tanzania
Blogging emerged in Tanzania around 2007 and became popular as an alternative news platform with educated, middle-class people, as well as politicians and political parties.
In Tanzania, where media historically holds strong ties to government interests, blogging opened up possibilities for individuals to establish private news outlets that proved immensely powerful in terms of reach and readership.
Before the rise of mobile apps, access to a stable Internet connection and laptop were imperative for bloggers.
This set a relatively high barrier to participation for people with limited income.
Michuzi blog, launched in 2005 by Issa Michuzi, who is known as the 'father of all Swahili blogs', was one of the earliest and most widely read blogs in Tanzania, often reporting on politics and news, with thousands of readers per day.
Michuzi was the first in Tanzania to see blogging as a business.
He managed to keep his content free and accessible yet clearly capitalized on the power of ads to generate income.
Although Tanzania's poverty rate fell from 60 percent in 2007 to an estimated 47 percent in 2016, nearly 12 million Tanzanians still live in extreme poverty.
Internet access remains low at approximately 45 percent as of 2017.
With a population of about 60 million people and 31 percent residing in urban areas, blogging is still out of reach for most.
According to Tanzania Bloggers Network Secretary-General Krantz Mwantepele, as quoted in The Citizen, many Tanzanian bloggers cannot afford these fees because the "license applications and annual subscriptions are way beyond earnings of many bloggers."
Will Tanzanian bloggers push back or pay up in a tense political climate?
Blogging continues to be a 'new frontier' for young Africans seeking new platforms to connect, discuss and analyze.
With the rise of mobile apps, Tanzanian youth are online more than ever with nearly 60 percent on Facebook alone in 2017.
Yet restrictions on freedom of expression pose a real challenge to social media users in Tanzania.
While the constitution allows for freedom of speech, it does not guarantee press freedom.
A set of media regulations provide Tanzanian authorities with the capacity to restrict media based on arguments of national security.
Authorities have become increasingly reliant on these rules as political tensions have risen over the past three years.
Since the presidential elections in 2015, Tanzania's opposition has been restricted by a ban on opposition rallies and the stifling of independent media, sanctions, intimidation, and punishment of citizens for criticising President John P. Magufuli of the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM, Swahili for 'Revolutionary Party').
In December 2016, Tanzanian police arrested Maxence Melo, founder and director of Jamii Forums, a hugely popular Tanzanian online community, for refusing to disclose information on its members, a demand made under the Cybercrimes Act.
Melo was released after five days, but his arrest revealed disturbing implications for anyone writing and speaking actively online in forums and blogs in Tanzania.
Most recently, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendelo (CHADEMA, Swahili for 'Party for Democracy and Progress'), Tanzania's largest opposition party, requested international intervention in the increasingly tense political situation characterized by the arrests of prominent opposition leaders.
On February 16, 2018, a young student was killed allegedly by a stray-bullet, and several others were injured as the police dispersed an opposition rally in Dar es Salaam.
These new regulations appear to be less about taxation but rather a convenient tool and part of a wider process to limit freedom of speech and participatory multiparty politics in Tanzania.

Jordan is the world’s second water-poorest country.
One of its major surface water resources, the Jordan River, is shared with Israel, and another one, the Yarmouk River, is shared with Syria—both of which leave a fairly small share of water for Jordan.
When it comes to the 12 identified groundwater basins countrywide, sustainability is a concern as some are exploited to their maximum capacity, and others are overexploited, threatening their future use.
The situation has been exasperated by the 1.4 million additional people residing in Jordan and relying on its finite water resources, due to the Syrian war.
And looking to the future, climate change only threatens to make it worse.
Scientists from Stanford University predict that by the end of the century, Jordan could be 4°C hotter, with about a third less rain.
Thus, it is threatened with absolute scarcity, as droughts and their duration are expected to double between 2071 and 2100.
Although the struggle is undeniable, the 9,903,877 citizens of Jordan do not all feel it equally.
The government’s failure to provide water for some places can often be linked to the area’s social status.
Sara Bader, a former resident of Amman's Al-Yasmine neighborhood (a rather crowded and less than average neighborhood) talked to Global Voices about her experience when she moved to Abdoun (an area considered to be for the elite classes):
We would get water two times a week , sometimes in the summer that is barely enough to get us through the week, so we would time doing the laundry and other water-consuming activities with the day the water would get pumped.
We would always be very cautious when it came to water consumption.
Now , the water is pumped daily, and my mother does not care what day of the week it is for her to do laundry.
It may seem unfair for an area to have 24/7 water pumping while another only gets it twice a week, but the truth is that getting water pumped twice a week is a privilege that many Jordanians in the less fortunate places dream of.
In the poorer areas of Amman, in the provinces, and most importantly in the villages, water is pumped every 20 days, and sometimes not at all.
In a letter sent to the government to complain about the water issue, a citizen residing in the Jerash province stated:
I am delivering the struggle of hundreds of people to you—people whom have not had water pumped to them in 30 or 20 or 19 days.
He continued:
I have proof that some water pipes have not held water for over a year because city hall has not been pumping water to these places, not even once a month.
The comments on the letter by his fellow Jordanians indicate that the problem is shared by others.
Many advised him to move to a house “next to a government representative” or “to a better neighborhood” so that he gets better water service, as infrequent pumping is “unnoticeable” in the “elite” neighborhoods.
A huge issue in the provinces is that families there often have more members, and that a large amount of these citizens are farmers who desperately need the water for their crops as well.
Not to mention that the government bills people for water service whether the citizens actually receive the service or not.
In the case that they don’t, they have to buy water that is delivered by non-government-owned water services (or “water tanks”, as they are colloquially known).
Thus, they have to pay two bills: one issued by the government, and one by whoever you hire to fill your tanks.
The price set by the government for these water tanks is 4 Jordanian dinars (6 US dollars per meter), already an amount that many people can't afford, but some of these services exploit citizens in their time of need, charging 5 dinars.
What is the reason behind the government's apparent neglect of the provinces when it come to their supply of water?
An employee in the Water and Irrigation Ministry who spoke with GV and who preferred to remain anonymous said:
The reality is different than most people’s assumptions: it is not that the ministry is biased in the schedule, it is simply that the poorer areas have weak infrastructure and pipes which cannot stand continuous pumping as they already leak 2/3 of the water pumped through them.
That is why these places do not have a non-stop supply of water, because the ministry cannot afford losing that much water on a daily basis, thus the water is pumped every week or every two weeks, and most of it is not delivered because of the leaks.
When asked why the ministry does not fix the leaks in the pipes or replace them all together, he simply commented that the budget cannot currently prioritize that.
However, the government promises a fairer distribution of water this year and that the provinces' supply of water is secured for the summer.

The male form in various states of undress has featured in Nepali art for centuries.
Just look at the Chakrasamvara Mandala, a 13th-century Nepali paubha painting depicting the union of the deity Chakrasamvara and his consort Vajravarahi, or the many statues in erotic poses found at the Hindu temples of Kathmandu.
Nevertheless, painting nudes and exhibiting them in public still requires a bit of courage in Nepal.
Traditional gender roles in Nepali society see men as the caretakers of their families, which means they should be muscular and tough.
As in other parts of the world, this "macho" expectation means that men in Nepal aren’t always comfortable with vulnerability or talking about their bodies or sexuality.
To start a dialogue about what it means to be a man and celebrate the male form, two Nepali artists, Kapil Mani Dixit and Roshan Mishra, are exhibiting their male nude art series at Gallery Mcube in the city of Patan until 19 February 2018.
@men'snude art ... met these two wonderful artists @r0shanmishra & Kapil Mani who are trying to beautify a man's body as well as presenting the emotional suffering men go through for being a man.

Talking to Global Voices, Kapil explained, “While men appreciate the female bodies, why do they sheepishly look at male bodies?”
God has created equally beautiful male and female bodies.
Male are as handsome as female are beautiful.
Let’s celebrate about our body.
Why is it that we shouldn’t talk about it?
“The pink in my painting connotes the access the society hasn’t given us.
It has put us in shackles within the pink colour,” says Kapil.

Residents of Boracay in the central Philippine province of Aklan are mobilizing against a plan by the government to shut down and environmentally "rehabilitate" the world-famous resort island for six months, at the same time that two casinos are in the works.
Fearing loss of employment for thousands of workers and the destruction of an economy based on resort operations in Boracay, residents formed the #NoToBoracayClosure Coalition to defend people’s livelihoods and oppose moves to transform the island into a mega-casino complex:
We are calling on President Rodrigo Duterte to rescind his blanket closure order of the country’s premier tourist destination.
We also call on the national government to come up with a scientific and comprehensive rehabilitation plan for Boracay that will not result to massive economic dislocation after due consultation with all its stakeholders.
Boracay has long received flak from environmentalists, but these issues suddenly came into the spotlight in February 2018.
Calling the resort island a “cesspool,” Duterte declared he would close down the island after six months if these environmental problems were not solved immediately.

Duterte's outburst came after an inspection of the island by the government’s tourism and environment agencies in January.
Duterte then ordered Cabinet to prepare for the closure of the island by April 26, without consultation with local stakeholders and in the absence of any master plan for the development and rehabilitation of the island, or contingency plans for the livelihoods and relocation of those affected.
Several sectors became suspicious of Duterte’s intentions after reports came out that the government has granted the Macau-based Galaxy Entertainment Group (GEG) permission to construct a US$500 million casino complex in the prime tourist destination.
The Presidential Palace announced it was cancelling the deal, yet the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has in fact granted a permit to GEG and its local partner, Leisure and Resorts World Corporation (LRWC).
The company dismissed claims by officials that they are looking for another venue for the casino.
Duterte denied knowledge of a plan to construct a casino on Boracay, but official photos show the president meeting with GEG representatives, led by its chairman Lui Che-Woo and vice chairman Francis Lui Yiu Tiung, at the Presidential Palace on December 6, 2017.
Duterte meets with officials of Macau-based casino magnates Galaxy Entertainment Group at the Presidential Palace last December 6, 2017.

PAGCOR officials also said that a second mega-casino complex is in the works in Boracay, following its approval of gaming operations by a joint venture between tycoon Andrew Tan and Malaysia’s Genting Group at the Savoy Hotel, located at Megaworld Corporation’s Boracay New Coast development.
To allay public outrage over the contradiction between the avowed aim of environmental rehabilitation and the building of mega-casinos on the island, Duterte then claimed that Boracay would in fact be subjected to land reform.
But many find this statement outlandish, given that there is not much farmland left on the resort island, most of whose area is already occupied by residential and commercial structures.
The laments of Boracay residents over Duterte’s closure order are captured in a short documentary by Jason Magbanua posted on Facebook, which was contextualized with the following text: FACT
Thousands upon thousands of real people will be affected by a complete closure of the island.
Real, breathing humans, not statistics.
We are talking about kids, mothers, fathers, entire families – not an "insignificant GDP drop.
FACT
There are more realistic solutions in solving the problems of Boracay.
Solutions that won't completely disenfranchise the people inhabiting the island, the greatest, most important stakeholders of them all.
For Ilonggo blogger Samot Tallana, the handling of the Boracay issue only exposes the bankruptcy of President Duterte's environmentalist and populist pretensions.
Mass layoffs of tourism workers in the island have already begun as business establishments scramble to cope with the shutdown.
Electricity prices across Aklan are likewise expected to shoot up as the province’s lone power supplier seeks to recover the P99 million (US$1.9 million) loss from the island’s closure.
Many also question the draconian security measures imposed by the government, such as the deployment of riot police, restricting access to many parts of Boracay, and preventing the media from monitoring the planned rehabilitation of the island.
Concerned citizens put up Friends of Boracay network to help campaign against the island's closure.

While many agree on the need to address Boracay’s environmental woes, the economic destruction to be wrought by the arbitrary and sudden closure of the island has compelled different sectors to close ranks behind the affected residents and workers.
A Friends of Boracay Facebook page has been set up to gather statements of support for the island, its workers, and its small and medium enterprises.
As the date of the island’s closure nears, they are calling on the public to take a stand for Boracay and the people who will be displaced by its closure.
As Ugandan president Museveni plans a social media tax to curb gossip, netizens are concerned over freedom of expression.
Image by Pixabay via CC0 Creative Commons, used with permission.
In early April 2018, Museveni directed the Ministry of Finance to introduce taxes on "over the top" communication platforms (OTTs) such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.
In Museveni's view, social media users use these platforms for what he called 'lugambo' (meaning gossip in Lugwere).
In a statement quoted by The Daily Monitor, Musveni explained his position:
However, lugambo on social media (opinions, prejudices, insults, friendly chats) and advertisements by Google and I do not know who else must pay tax because we need resources to cope with the consequences of their lugambo...
The president accused the Finance Ministry and Uganda Revenue Authority of not working hard enough to identify new sources of taxes, lamenting that the government currently lacks tax income.
The government's attention to "over-the-top" applications raises a long-standing issue that many governments have taken with IP-based (Internet Protocol) communication applications, such as WhatsApp, which are free of charge for any person with internet access.
Government actors (in Uganda and many other countries) have long voiced concern about losses in revenue for national telecom operators that were once the primary providers (and cost beneficiaries) of these services.
Museveni assures citizens that this tax will not affect those who use the internet for educational purposes, arguing that it will only affect those who spend time online engaging in idle gossip.
In an opinion piece for The Daily Monitor, Daniel Bill Opio called the social media tax "regressive":
Social media being a widely used platform for communication, and most importantly as means to access of information, imposing of taxes thereon will be an impediment to the enjoyment of various rights.
Indeed, officials have offered no information about how (or by whom) social media content will be judged for its quality.
If gossip or rumors take a political tone, could this lead to taxation or even indirect censorship of political criticism?
Netizens have also expressed doubts about the economic rationale behind the proposal.
Democratic Party President Norbert Mao wrote on his Facebook page:
At a time when other countries are cutting the costs of internet, President Museveni wants to increase its cost.
We actually need to aspire to making internet free.
Some are questioning whether these taxes will truly benefit Ugandans or if they will be used for Museveni's personal gains, as has been alleged in the past:
Uganda wants to profit where it did not invest.
Social media owners gave it out for free and you wanna tax it?
Is it an opportunity to increase revenue, avoiding transparency or just GREED?!! — Trish (@trish886) April 9, 2018
The fact that social media was blocked twice on election day in Uganda on February 18, 2016, and during the swearing in of the president in May 2016 discourages poet and human rights lawyer Kizza Ebron:
The proposal to tax social has a bothersome background.
Eron goes on to compare social media to a public highway:
Social media is a high way.
The proposed tax on social media use is a military road block.
Kyambadde Ronald, a health and social justice advocate, tweets:
The government of Uganda should at some point understand that the citizens are not gold mines, which they'll exploit vehemently, how on earth can you justify, the ongoing saga of new taxes- social media tax, banking tax etc?
Internet World Stats reports that Uganda currently has about 19 million internet subscribers, with 43 percent of the population online.
The move to tax social media users could increase the digital gap if cost barriers rise.
This is only one way in which spaces for civic engagement are shrinking in Uganda.
A January 2018 report from Unwanted Witness, a Ugandan NGO, painted a dim picture for free expression online in Uganda:
2017 registered the highest number of Ugandans ever arrested for their online expression and these arrests are clearly targeted crackdown on free flow of information and speech on the Internet.
In March 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission put out a directive to all online content creators to register their websites, creating yet another barrier to free expression online.
The directive read:
All online data communication service providers, including online publishers, online news platforms, online radio and television operators are therefore, advised to apply and obtain authorisation from the Commission with immediate effect.
As of now, it is still not clear how the "gossip tax" will be implemented or monitored, or when it will take effect.
Bangabandhu Satellite-1 Mission at Cape Canaveral, USA.

At 4:14 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on May 11, 2018, Bangabandhu-1, Bangladesh’s first geostationary communications satellite, was launched into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida in the United States.
It marked a key milestone for the country and was celebrated throughout Bangladesh.
Bangabandhu-1, named after the nickname of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh, was launched into its orbital slot on 119.1 degrees east longitude.
The satellite's mission is expected to last at least 15 years.
The launch was originally planned for May 10 and postponed to take place the following day after an error was found just a minute before launch.
A delegation of Bangladeshi officials, led by State Minister for Telecommunications and Post, Tarana Halim, arrived in Florida on Tuesday to witness the successful launch.
Peter B. de Selding, the editor of Space Intel Report tweeted:

Work began on the 7,700-pound (3,700-kilogram) satellite back in 2015, when it was ordered from France-based Thales Alenia Space by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.
The launch also marked a milestone for the company SpaceX, who was contracted to carry out the launch itself.
It was the debut of a new upgrade to their launch vehicle, known as Falcon 9 Block 5, which is a more reusable, higher-thrust model.
SpaceX is an American company founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk.
SpaceX produced a live webcast of the launch, which can be viewed online:
Bangabandhu-1 will provide satellite television, internet access, and emergency communication services, as well as broadband to rural areas in Bangladesh, and will be operated by the newly-formed state-owned company the Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Ltd, after having been led by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Committee (the BTRC) up until this point.
According to the Dhaka Tribune, Bangladesh’s annual expenditure for satellite connectivity is currently 14 million USD spent on renting bandwidth from foreign operators.
It is predicted that with the launch of Bangabandhu-1, this cost will significantly decrease.
Incredible moment yesterday. #Bangabandhu Satellite-1 being celebrated.

The satellite will offer Ku-band coverage over Bangladesh and its territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
On Twitter, Bangladeshi citizens expressed their support for the mission, despite the early hour of the launch.
Farhan Hossain tweeted:

As Brazil creates new mechanisms to prevent the spread of fake news, internet freedom activists are worried this will restrict free speech.
Imaged shared by Digital Spy on Flickr, with permission: CC BY-NC-SA 2.0
In early December 2017, Brazil's government established a committee to monitor and possibly order the blocking of false news reports on social media ahead of the 2018 presidential elections.
The news has raised concerns about censorship among the public.
The "Consultative Council on Internet and Elections" will operate under the auspices of the Superior Electoral Court and includes representatives from the Court, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the army, the national intelligence agency, the federal police, SaferNet (a Brazilian non-governmental organization (NGO) that combats online crime in partnership with the Federal Public Ministry) and researchers from the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (a private university).
In its first meeting, the Council proposed to create a tool through which users could file reports to the Council itself of news that appeared suspicious.
This would work as an extension of existing hotlines and website forms where voters can submit complaints to report irregularities in traditional media.
The Council has not yet further explained how the tool would operate in terms of asking social media companies to remove news deemed false or targeting people and groups that post false news.
Members say they are negotiating support from social media companies, but it remains unclear where this will lead.
When Facebook introduced a "report fake news" feature in December 2016, it showed that many users reported fake content as part of an effort to discredit information or ideas with which they disagreed, even when those ideas were based on verified facts.
This move comes amid deep political uncertainty in Brazil approaching the 2018 elections, which will be the first ballot following the controversial impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party in 2016.
The party's de-facto candidate for 2018 is former president Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva, who leads the presidential polls at 34% and has spent the past few months touring the country rallying crowds despite having been sentenced in July to nearly 10 years in prison for accepting bribes from construction companies during his term.
A court is expected to rule on his appeal on January 24.
Large-scale corruption investigations have convicted dozens of politicians in the past three years, opening the grounds for outsiders and far-right candidates like Jair Bolsonaro, the federal deputy and former military officer, notorious for homophobic diatribes as well as tough-talking on criminals and drug-dealers.
Should Lula's conviction be upheld, a fragmented, polarized and heavily disputed electoral landscape is expected.
More rules aimed at minimizing 'fake news'
The committee is only one of the immediate outcomes of the Superior Electoral Court's current preoccupation with 'fake news.'
The judges have openly defended the creation of additional legal mechanisms to suppress reports deemed as false.
In hearings on the rules for 2018 elections, Justice Luis Fux, who will preside over the court starting in February, spoke of creating preventive measures to curb the spread of false information.
This could include the freezing of assets and even prison time for those who could be "preparing themselves to perpetuate this kind of deleterious strategy which, so to say, in informal language, have melted some nominations."
Additionally, the Brazilian Congress is analysing a bill that would render sharing false reports on social media a crime punishable by two to eight months in prison or a fine of 1,500 to 4,000 BRL (500-1200 USD) per day.
The bill makes a criminal offense "to publish or share, through any means, on the internet, false or unfairly incomplete information to the detriment of a private individual or legal persons."
Internet freedom activists speak out
Internet freedom activists have expressed concern over the bill and the creation of the Consultative Council.
An open letter published by Coalizão Direitos na Rede (Internet Rights Coalition) during this year's Brazil Internet Forum (a regional meeting prior to the global Internet Governance Forum) criticised the military's poor record when it comes to respecting civil liberties in Brazil (Brazil was governed by a United States-supported military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985):
The Armed Forces must not monopolize control over the veracity of facts because 1) they do not possess that constitutional authority; 2) they do not have the technical capacity for this 3) they do not possess the necessary knowledge to distinguish fake news; and 4) they are not neutral in politics.
To make it worse, these institutions have left violent and deep scars in the country's recent history by promoting the curtailment of freedom of expression and public demonstration of Brazilians during the civil-military dictatorship.
The creation of the committee by the Superior Electoral Court was also mentioned in a collective statement signed by 38 organizations from Latin America and the Caribbean as an example of how the discourse on fake news can be used to restrict free speech.
The letter expresses concerns over how hysteria over fake news eclipses the long-standing efforts for better regulation of media monopolies which dominate the mainstream media landscape in the region and has historically engaged in campaigns of misinformation during elections or otherwise:
We cannot discount years of work and debate from the movement for democratization of communications and adopt the “fake news” terminology as a completely new phenomenon in Latin America.

On April 19, 2018, the Republic of Cuba swore in former university professor Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez as its new president and the 9th Congress of the National Assembly of People’s Power—the country’s supreme body of government power—elected a new Council of State.
But the euphoria and uncertainty surrounding a supposed “Cuba without Castros” and related matters have eclipsed another major development: the presence of four Black leaders who will be part of the new government through 2023.
Black Cubans make 10% of the population but their representation in circles of power has been very limited, in spite of ideals of equality after the revolution.
Before Bermúdez, the previous Congress had two Black men in senior positions: First Vice President Juan Esteban Lazo Hernández and Salvador Valdés Mesa, President of the National Assembly.
With the selection of Inés María Chapman Waugh and Beatriz Jhonson Urrutia as vice presidents, Cuba has, so to speak, “added more color” to the government.
Before I discuss the two women, I want to spend a minute on Valdés Mesa and Lazo Hernández.
Valdés, who previously held the positions of secretary of the Workers’ Central Union of Cuba, Minister of Labor and Social Security, and Secretary of Agricultural Workers, among others, is not from the generation of “los históricos” meaning those who led the 1959 Cuban Revolution, and who have usually ceded power only when they’re ousted or have died.
He is from the generation that followed, as is Lazo, who was elected President of the National Assembly in 2013 and will keep the position until 2023, when he will be 79.
Lazo has a long and varied trajectory in Cuban politics. He has been secretary of the Cuba Communist Party for the Matanzas, Santiago de Cuba, and Havana provinces, a member of the Cuban parliament since 1981, and Vice President of the Council of State since 1992.
Lazo has also represented Cuba’s foreign affairs with countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.
He was elected President of the National Assembly of People’s Power on February 25, 2013.
A new crucible of scrutiny
The two new women vice presidents are, by parliamentary standards, relatively young if we consider age in the Legislature—only about 13% of members are under 35.
Ines María Chapman Waugh, from Holguín, is an engineer.
Currently president of the National Hydraulic Resources Institute, for Cubans she’s a household name.
For some time now she’s been the face of the agency she heads, offering the public important information during hurricane season.
She was a member of the National Assembly for the preceding Congress and has been a member of the Council of State since 2008.
In 2011 she was elected to the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party.
Beatriz Jhonson Urrutia is also an engineer.
In 2011 she was elected vice president of the Provincial Assembly of People’s Power in her native province of Santiago de Cuba.
She became President of this body in 2016.
In the 7th Congress round a decade ago she was elected to the Central Committee. She became a member of parliament in 2013.
Both Chapman Waugh and Jhonson Urrutia come from the grassroots and developed professional careers prior to or alongside their political ones.
As Black women, they’ve had to work hard at getting their degrees and building their careers to this point. And these latest appointments don’t mean they have arrived.
Now they enter another crucible, where they’ll be “tested” due to their blackness and subjected to racist scrutiny and the expectation that sooner or later they will undoubtedly mess up.
Silence is also racism
Why haven’t the Cuban and international press, and people in general, embraced and hailed these developments with enthusiasm?
I find it suspicious, considering that in the current political scenario this is a bigger surprise than Díaz-Canel, whose appointment was expected.
The media has now turned its attention to the first lady and other superficialities while continuing to ignore this key piece of news.
Making things invisible is one of the ways racism operates.
At times silence says more than words ever could.
What I think is at work here is a combination of fear of Blackness with the casual neo-racism of everyday life.
This includes the official notion, in Cuba, that speaking of Blackness, racism, and racial discrimination divides the nation.
About this last point, I want to add that even among the most committed social and political activists and laypeople, the idea persists that considering racial issues in any way dilutes a vaguely defined “supreme goal”.
It’s from this position that notions ranging from the term “Afro-Cuban” to whether there is structural racism in the country are challenged.
While it is fair to assume there’ll be no change to race-related policies, it’s worth pointing out that the arrival of these three Black legislators, especially the two women, speaks favorably of the drive towards inclusion.
Or, at the very least, it hints that it has been taken into account in the highest spheres of power on the island.
We can assume that no one holding a seat in the National Assembly has an explicit anti-racism political agenda.
As members of the Cuban Parliament, how could they?
And I see this as evidence of racism, along with the particularities of the Cuban electoral system and the intricacies of how one becomes “political” in Cuba.
This is a country where independent activism falls outside of legitimatized spaces of power—which creates the anomalous situation where people completely lacking in political interests or public recognition can sit, for five years, in the supreme branch of government.
Changing that would require convincing those in the corridors of power that racism is currently Cuba’s most urgent problem.
It’s connected to many others, such as poverty. It limits the enjoyment of basic and universal rights such as access to university education.
The fear of tackling the issue is evident in the minimal impact that so many race-related publications, research and theses have had on Cuba’s decision-makers.
I wonder what else is needed to prompt an open acknowledgement of this matter and everything it entails—and the ensuing public policy proposals to address racism.
Racial issues are not listed as topic/objective in any of the ten permanent working groups of the National Assembly of People’s Power.
I can think of at least three that are relevant to the issue of race: the Commission for the Attention of Childhood, Youth, and Equal Rights for Women; the Commission on Economic Issues; and the Commission of Education, Culture, Science, Technology, and the Environment.
There's no racism in Cuba, ¿de verdad?
If there’s a subject on which Cubans at opposite ends of the political spectrum agree, it's racial discrimination.
Both supporters and opponents of the Cuban government assert wholeheartedly that “in Cuba blacks and whites are the same.”
For government supporters on and off the island, the situation looks good enough, including on this issue.
For opponents everywhere, things in Cuba are so terrible and everyone is so equally oppressed that racial discrimination is unworthy of special attention.
These dynamics hijack the discussion and keep us from moving forward.
Among some in the exile community, Cuban-flavored racism has even superseded anti-government animosity.
A screenshot from Facebook: “Diaz Canel is not the worst of it all.
It’s the “N*****-load” left by Raúl Castro within inches of Power.
The next Cuban government, and formed from exile, has to exclude Black candidates…no ties to the regime, witchcraft, laziness, theft, and mediocrities” By now, we should have been implementing solutions, for example, to the problem of the overrepresentation of Black and mixed-race Cubans in the prison population.
There should already be progress towards affirmative action on self-employment community projects.
Nevertheless, the fact that there are now more senior politicians representing Black Cubans, even if imperfectly, fills me with optimism.
I do not ask anything of our three Black VicePresidents that I wouldn’t ask of other legislators, but tackling racism and discrimination in Cuba requires the participation of all members of the society, within the spaces of power and privilege each of them occupies.

According to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, at least 34 people, including one journalist, have been killed during demonstrations in Nicaragua over the past several days.
What began as a protest against social security reforms has expanded into a broad-based public outcry against the administration of President Daniel Ortega, who has been in office for 11 years but has held political power in the country in various roles since the 1979 Sandinista Revolution.
Some are now calling for his resignation.
Multiple TV networks have been taken off air or banned from broadcasting the demonstrations and one radio station was set on fire.
Independent local news sites La Prensa and Confidencial suffered what appeared to be distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
Both had been reporting the most up-to-date accounts from the ground.
Confidencial was knocked offline for seven hours on April 23.
In a tweet confirming the attacks, Editor Carlos Chamorro wrote:
TO OUR READERS For the past three hours, the Confidencial website has been out of service.
We have determined that the cause is a targeted attack by the enemies of press freedom.
Our technical staff are working to reestablish the site connection.
We will continue posting updates on our social media channels.
The Inter-American Press Association the website condemned the attacks.
In the city of Bluefields, on Nicaragua’s southern Caribbean coast, video journalist Angel Gahona was shot and killed while filming and broadcasting a confrontation between protesters and police on Facebook Live.
Gahona lived with his family and ran a small media outlet called El Meridiano.
Multiple witnesses said the police were the only people in the area with weapons powerful enough to shoot and kill a person.
Police have yet to release a statement regarding Gahona’s death.
Gahona did not die immediately on impact, and thus managed to capture the moments after he was shot, which have now been seen worldwide via YouTube and news media outlets.
In an interview with Univisión, his sister said: “I never imagined that he would film his own death.”
The Organization of American States and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have condemned the media bans and the killing of Angel Gahona.
His family members are soliciting support for funeral costs and their future on GoFundMe.
Spanish activist arrested for insulting monarchy on Facebook
Roberto Mesa, a digital activist in the Spanish island of Tenerife, was arrested by police at his home on April 18 after he posted a message on Facebook suggesting that the Bourbons (the royal family) should go “to the sharks”.
In Spanish, the message rhymes: "Los Borbones, a los tiburones."
Supporters anticipate that he will be charged under Spain’s public security law, commonly referred to as the gag law (“Ley Mordaza”), which places multiple prohibitions on public and online protest.
Tanzanian news and discussion website suffers DDoS attack
Tanzanian news sharing and discussion platform Jamii Forums was briefly kicked offline this week due to a DDoS attack.
Known for intense political discussions and revelations of corruption that take place on its comment and discussion threads, in a style similar to that of Reddit, Jamii is one of the most popular local sites in East Africa.
The site’s co-founder and owner Maxence Melo is currently fighting charges under Tanzania’s Cybercrimes Law for refusing police requests for forum members’ personal data.
LGBT content gets uncensored in China, thanks to citizen pressure
The social media campaign #IamLGBT pressured China’s information control apparatus to scale back its censorship of LGBT content on social media.
But after Weibo announced a three-month crackdown on games, multimedia and LGBT content, the hashtag #IamLGBT was used 500,000 times and had roughly 500 million views.
Within days, the Chinese Communist Party publication the People’s Daily published a memorandum announcing LGBT content should not be confused with vulgar, violent or pornographic content, and Weibo announced its three-month crackdown would no longer target LGBT content.
Is a Russian troll farm really launching a news agency?
A Russian troll farm with connections to Saint Petersburg’s Internet Research Agency announced its plans to launch a new venture entitled “USA Really” next month.
The project, initially reported by EU vs Disinfo, takes a stance consistent with the anti-Western, anti-liberal narrative of previous Internet Research Agency efforts, which grabbed international headlines in 2016, before and after the presidential elections in the United States.
The self-described “news organization” RIA FAN announced:
The information flow coming from the US and its allies, which is aimed at discrediting the Russian Federation, should not remain unanswered by the Russian media…The Federal News Agency (FAN) is not going to put up with the hegemony of the US authorities in the information field.
YouTube takes down millions of videos, mostly for images of abuse and violence
YouTube removed more than 8.2 million videos between October and December 2017, 6.68 million of which had been flagged automatically by systems that are built to identify sexual abuse and violent extremism imagery.
The company published this information in its most recent transparency report, marking the first time that a major Silicon Valley company has included this level of detail about content removed from its platform.
Who will be next in line?
Facebook releases internal guidelines for content moderation
Facebook took steps toward making its content moderation processes more transparent by publishing most of the internal guidelines its moderators use to enforce its community standards.
The company excluded information about issues like terrorism to prevent users from taking advantage of the publication of the guidelines.
The company also announced plans to allow users to appeal the removal of a photo, video or post in addition to the removal of an account or page for certain categories of content.
In the future, Facebook says it will give people the opportunity to provide additional context and to allow users to appeal content that is reported and left up.

After sixty years of as the ruling party in Malaysia, Barisan Nasional (BN) was defeated at the 14th General Elections (GE14) on May 9, 2018.
The BN-led government was headed by Najib Razak who was linked to several corruption scandals.
Razak also became more unpopular as he tried to suppress the demand for accountability and transparency with regard to these corruption allegations.
Malaysia will now be led by 92-year-old Dr. Mahathir Mohamad who served as prime minister for 22 years until his retirement in 2003.
He became active again in politics to lead the Pakatan Harapan (PH) opposition party in challenging Razak and the ruling coalition he once led.
The final tally of the GE14 reflected the dissatisfaction of most Malaysians to the performance of Razak's government.
Many Malaysian netizens celebrated the news about the historic voting result:
Can you believe it?
We won.
At 3.30 A.M on the 10th of May 2018, Barisan Nasional is no longer our ruler.
A few hours from now, the sun will begin to rise over the horizon.
How poignant.. we'll see a new Malaysia greeting us.
The future awaits us, let's go to sleep.#GE14 — K.A C-137 (@terimame) May 9, 2018
Today, history has been made 🇲🇾
• new government after 61 years
• Malaysia first female deputy minister
• the oldest (93y/o) candidate won
• the youngest (22y/o) candidate won
A proud first time voter here! #GE14 — Ana (@nmalyanah) May 9, 2018
On his first day in office, the new president tweeted:
First day on the job... once again. pic.twitter.com/Oxe3E8OEuU — Dr Mahathir Mohamad (@chedetofficial) May 11, 2018
He vowed to investigate agencies involved in corruption.
He also reaffirmed the pledge of the opposition to abolish repressive laws, taxes, and programs.
"We also want to abolish laws that are oppressive and unfair.
We will abolish the fake news act..." - Dr Mahathir. #GE14 — Sumisha Naidu (@SumishaCNA) May 10, 2018
Malaysiakini, an independent news website, highlighted the importance of the opposition victory:
This is the day Malaysians experienced the power of the ballot.
Anger towards the current administration had brought them out in large numbers to cast their votes in the historic 14th general election.
This is the first time the country has witnessed a change of government since independence from the British in 1957.
The paper made a point to remind the new government of urgent reforms necessary to ‘heal’ the nation:
Now the hard work begins.
No one should be under the illusion that a new government would be able to reverse the rot that had taken root for decades.
For a country that is so divided, it would take time to heal the wounds, and for Malaysians to rebuild the trust for one another and for the many institutions that have failed them.
Aliran, a civil society group, also celebrated the outcome of the GE14 while enumerating some of the challenges faced by the new government:
Aliran salutes the people of Malaysia who rose up, braved the odds stacked against them and used their vote to make this happen.
We salute too the many women and men who worked (many of them for decades) in bringing about the awareness necessary for this change to take place.
The outcome of the general election is a testament to the power of the people to bring about change.
Around the world, Malaysia has set a good example – that of People Power and that of a peaceful transition of government.
PH must work towards dismantling the many structures which have kept the corrupt in power for so long.
This also entails, among other things, curbing the power of the executive and the restoration of other institutions badly tainted by political interference.
This tweet summarizes the sentiment of many a day after the historic GE14:
Even with PH winning, changes will not happen immediately.
There's still so many things to be fixed so we gotta be patient enough for when that happens.
Let's focus on maintaining peace and keep things in view for a better tomorrow, for a better Malaysia. #GE14 — Lum Bao Yi (@CHANIEL96) May 9, 2018
A photo of her destructed house.
Taken by Lens of a Damascene Young Man.
This is the testimony of Um Mohammed; a kind, 61-year-old woman from Zamalka.
Um Mohammed's kindness reflects of her face with its childish features.
Her cheeks still turn red when she is agitated.
Um Mohammed loves old songs and memorizes quite a few. As a loving grandmother, she adores little children and could play with them for hours.
Um Mohammed used to live in Zamalka, a town of Eastern Ghouta.
Its population was estimated at 150,000 in the last census.
Zamalka fell out of the regime's control in 2012.
Since then it has been subjected to a stifling siege, along with all the towns of Eastern Ghouta.
Zamlaka endured continuous heavy shelling daily.
In this testimony, the forcibly displaced Um Mohammed talks about her home and family in Zamalka and about her connection to that house and its furniture:
I have three daughters and a son.
My three daughters remained with me in Ghouta, while my son fled seven years ago.
The siege deprived me the opportunity to attend his wedding, or to be with him when his son was born.
I lived in the family house.
A very old house that my husband inherited from his father who inherited it from his father and so on.
Generation after generation grew up in that house.
Those of them who are still alive hold so many fond memories of it.
Over time, as the house needed renovation, we carried the work while being very diligent so as to maintain its original features.
We wanted to preserve its soul.
During the siege all means of fuel became very scarce, or unbelievably expensive.
So we had to rely on wood for heating, cooking, bathing and sometimes even for lighting.
As shelling intensified during the last stretch since February, it became impossible to leave the basements and go out to buy wood.
The lack of proper ventilation in the basements and the dampness exacerbated the feeling of cold.
One day in that basement, as the shelling was burning the city, we had to use the furniture for heating.
I will never forget that mad shelling that burned our memories and the memories of all those around us.
It wiped any trace of us in Zamalka, our homeland, before we were completely uprooted.
The first pieces of furniture we burnt were the couches, and this was due to hunger.
My grandchildren were hungry, and the extensive shelling prevented us from going outside to get wood.
Even if someone would risk their life outside, there was no one selling anything in that hell.
My son in law asked for my permission to break the couch to use its wood for cooking fire.
I approved, but something inside me was shattered.
That couch carried a beautiful story.
My husband bought it ten years after our marriage.
He was so happy that we could afford it.
We picked it together.
It was one of the very few times we were able to go out together without the kids.
Yes, I might be able to restore material belongings, but the memories attached to them, how could they ever be recuperated?
The pain was greater when we had to set my bedroom furniture on fire.
That bedroom accompanied me for 35 years, ever since I got married.
It witnessed the best, and the worst days of my life.
The scent of my beloved late husband lingered there.
I used to sense his spirit floating around it, that's why I felt he was beside me whenever I fell asleep.
I burnt most of my clothes.
For instance that gown I wore for my eldest daughter's wedding.
I remember going with her to the tailor and having it tailor made for the occasion, along with her own wedding dress.
My own mantles, which became my attire ever since I grew older and became a grandmother.
I managed to salvage only one of them to take with me when we are eventually forcibly displaced.
Out of my kitchen utensils that survived the shelling, I burnt all the plastics because they were highly flammable and provided extra warmth.
What was important was for my children and grandchildren to eat and feel some warmth.
In our traditions, the bride's family would send with her to her husband's house a glass cabinet where lavish plates and cutlery would be displayed.
Usually this cabinet is passed on through the generations.
But after all the glassware in my cabinet was shattered due to the shelling, we broke it to pieces and used its wood to warm water for bathing.
Yet the hardest situation I had to overcome was taking the decision to burn my son's wardrobe.
My son, whom I haven't seen for seven years.
That wardrobe held all the beautiful memorabilia of his childhood.
His toys, his baby clothes, even his favorite cup.
I can't carry all that with me on that bus of forcible displacement.
But I also can't destroy those memories with my own hands; nor can I leave them behind for strangers to fiddle around with after we were gone, or see them in videos being sold on the streets.
Eventually I had to make the decision to break and burn them.
I only kept very small items that I could carry with me.
That was the hardest situation of all.
For I always dreamed of giving my son his memorabilia back, and of seeing his son wearing his own clothes when he was his age, and of telling that grandson stories about the photos of his father.
I wanted my grandchildren to grow up in that house where I would tell them stories about their parents' mischievousness.
A home that i would pass on to them so they would in turn pass it on to their grandchildren; so that they would add to it a new life every time, just like every generation of our ancestors did.
Towards the end we even had to burn the doors of the house.
My house, the family house, my children's house, was left widely open, exposed and violated.
Following the horrible shelling offensive during which the Syrian regime and Russian forces showed us hell, we were forcibly removed from Zamalka as broken refugees.
It was impossible for us to live under the regime again.
That regime that can detain my sons in law or drag them to military service.
It was impossible especially knowing that my son would never go back to Zamlaka.
I left behind the family house and all the memories it nurtured.
I left to Idlib with my daughters and their families, broken hearted.
The one thing that offered me some consolation was that I was finally reunited with my son whom I didn't see for seven years and I held his son in my arms.
The one thing that gives me hope is that I know I will tell my grandson all about his grandfather, his father and the family house with all the memories it nurtured.
Upon our reunion I gave me son the small memorabilia that I managed to salvage from his wardrobe.
At the beginning he couldn't believe his eyes.
He couldn't believe that I managed to bring with me a piece of his memory.
At that moment I prayed for my son to go back to the family house, to rebuild it and raise his children in it.
Today I live with my son and his family, hopping from one house to the other until we manage to find a temporary settlement post, which I am confident will never, ever, replace my home.
A funeral was held for Sabika Sheikh in her hometown of Karachi on May 23, 2018, five days after the 17-year-old Pakistani exchange student in the US was killed by a teenage gunman who opened fire at a school in the state of Texas.
In total, 10 people were killed including Sheikh and 13 wounded in the violence.
Sheikh was an exchange student at Santa Fe High School under the US State Department-sponsored KL-YES program and was set to return home on June 10, 2018 after completing the program.
The news of her death took over social media in Pakistan, and messages of condolences poured in.
Before her body was sent to Pakistan, a funeral was also held in Texas on May 20, 2018.
Michael Mathes, a US politics correspondent for news agency AFP, tweeted:
Just devastating.

At her funeral in Texas, Sheikh's host parents spoke about how she had impacted their lives:
The host father is speaking about how Sabika Sheikh came into their lives.
Calls her the most precious gift that came into her life.
He says the root of everything is love.
He wants to carry the tradition of love she brought from Pakistan. #KAKEnews #SantaFe #SanteFeStrong pic.twitter.com/wThTbPVU6h — KAKE Monica Castro (@KAKEmonica) May 20, 2018
Her host mother Joleen Cogburn tearfully described what had motivated Sheikh to study in the US:
I asked how she got involved with wanting to become a foreign exchange student and why.
And she said because I want to learn the American culture and I want America to learn the Pakistan culture and I want us to come together and unite.
She said I don't know if they know us the way they should.
Of her own feelings about being selected to study in the US, Sheikh had said in a video message:
People around me got sad a little bit that I'll be leaving them, but this was the bestest thing that happened.
I was so very excited, I still am very excited.
US media often covers Pakistan, if it does so at all, through the lens of conflict.
A Pakistani-born, US-based Twitter user named Zareen Nayyar was one of many pointing out that Pakistan is often portrayed as the unsafe country:
Just a thought ... this girl born and raised in #Pakistan didn't die in her home country, which according to the west is doing nothing to fight #terrorism. Yet she comes to #America and dies in a #SchoolShooting. #irony#texasschoolshooting#SabikaSheikhhttps://t.co/FGlrC9wju9 — Zareen Nayyar (@zareennayyar) May 23, 2018
Mass shootings, including in schools, are a serious problem in the US.
According to data from Gun Violence Archive (via Vox), since 2012 at least 1,941 people have been killed and 7,104 wounded in at least 1,686 mass shootings, defined as an event in which four or more people (not counting the shooter) are shot at the same general time and location.
The US also has a high gun homicide rate.
Part of the problem, analysts say, is the ease of access to firearms in the US: the country has the world's highest rate of gun ownership.
Speaking to the media, Sheikh's father and uncle pleaded with the US government to make schools safer for their students.
With her death, the US mass shooting crisis has become an international concern.
Protesters in the Gambia following the election of Adama Barrow in 2017.
Screenshot from YouTube video, widely circulated.
The Supreme Court in the Gambia struck down the 2013 Information and Communication Amendment (ICA) Act, declaring it unconstitutional.
The court nevertheless upheld key sections of the country’s sedition law.
Both have been used as tools for media repression.
The ruling is the result of a 2015 court filing by the Gambia Press Union challenging the constitutionality of sedition, libel, criminal defamation, and false news laws.
The regional court of the Economic Community of West African States recently ruled on the same laws, in a case brought by four exiled Gambian journalists, and found them all unconstitutional.
But the Gambian Supreme Court thought differently.
The ruling upheld sedition laws that can be used to punish critical speech or journalistic investigations related to the president, while it struck down the a 2013 amendment to the ICA, which criminalized online defamation and the spread of “false news” on the internet.
Violators were subject to heavy fines and prison terms of up to 15 years in prison.
On Twitter, Gambian journalist Sanna Camara described the ICT Act as one of the “toughest internet laws in Africa.”
Camara himself faced legal threats in the Gambia for his coverage of human trafficking, published by The Standard.
In 2014, Camara was accused of publishing “false news” and fled the country shortly thereafter.
The Committee to Protect Journalists’ Angela Quintal described the decision as “one step forward, two steps backwards.”
“ sends a message that journalists are still not free to work without the threat of criminal prosecution,” she said.
The ruling marks the court’s first major decision affecting free speech since the 2017 transition of power from long-time ruler Yahya Jammeh to current president Adama Barrow.
Shortly after assuming office, Barrow freed hundreds of prisoners and launched a series of investigations into alleged human rights violations under the Jammeh regime.
But activists and citizens who speak their minds in public spaces online and off have continued to do so under pressure.
In February 2018, a university lecturer was detained over comments he made to a local media outlet.
Just this past week, youth activists were arrested after calling attention to the threat of environmental degradation caused by Golden Lead, a Chinese-owned fish processing factory in the coastal settlement of Gunjur.
Tanzanian court puts ‘blogger tax’ on hold, for now
A Tanzanian High Court has halted the implementation of the US $900 “blogger tax” imposed by the government as part of the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations which demanded that bloggers paid a fine or cease blogging.
Six human right groups in the country had asked the court to review the regulations, arguing that the Minister of Information acted outside his authority and in violation of the right to freedom of expression.
Though temporary, the high court ruling is a win for free speech in Tanzania.
Honduran journalist followed after receiving death threats on Facebook
Honduran broadcast journalist Mauricio Ortega received a death threat over Facebook messenger, not long after conducting a series of reports on incidents of passengers being physically assaulted on public transport.
Later that day, he was followed by a car with no license plates.
In an interview with the Honduran Committee for Free Expression, he said:
...threats against us have unfortunately become normal, we’re accustomed to being insulted, threatened and discredited by those who take offense at our work.
And sadly, there is little trust or efficiency in those who are supposed to ensure justice, which leaves us that much more vulnerable.
Mobile networks falter as Russians protest Putin’s inauguration
As protests broke out across Russia, approaching Vladimir Putin's official inauguration into his fourth term as president, several activists reported that their mobile phone signals became weak or non-existent.
Some said Russian telecom operators were intentionally degrading the quality of service or even delisting their numbers at the orders of the authorities.
Activist Denis Styazhkin reported that his telco operator, Beeline, told him that his number had been de-listed on police orders.
China’s censors have their eyes on Peppa Pig
A Chinese internet subculture connecting the TV cartoon character “Peppa Pig” with “Shehuiren”, a term that refers to organized crime syndicates, has resulted in a muddy puddle for the popular porker.
After leading state media outlets criticized the inkage, the popular Chinese video platform Douyan removed more than 30,000 videos of the cheerful pink character and made the term “Peppa Pig” unsearchable on its website, likely anticipating an all-out ban on Peppa.
Egyptian legislators move to monitor Uber rides
On May 7, Egypt’s parliament passed a law that will require ride-hailing services like Uber and the UAE-based Careem to establish servers in Egypt for the processing of all data pertaining to Egypt-based users.
The law, which is still awaiting executive approval, obligates these companies to provide user data (including information about the location of both riders and drivers) to security authorities at their request.
Both companies were temporarily suspended in March 2018 after a group of local taxi operators sued the companies on licensing grounds.
Will biometric ID cards become mandatory in Europe?
The European Commission proposed new counterterrorism measures including the mandatory inclusion of biometric data in ID cards and residence documents for EU residents and their family members.
This measure would require the majority of EU residents to be fingerprinted so that biometric identifiers can be checked at border points.
One voter got Cambridge Analytica to hand over his data.
What about the rest of us?
The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has given Cambridge Analytica 30 days to hand over all the data and personal information it has on one American voter, or face a criminal prosecution.
The voter, David Carroll, found that because Cambridge Analytica had processed US voter data in the UK, he could assert his rights under British laws.
Cambridge Analytica announced this week that it has gone into liquidation.

On May 11, 2018, a score of Cuban intellectuals and activists launched an exhaustive agenda for the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, intersexuals, trans, queer and intersex people in Cuba.
According to the submission:
Based on the Yogyakarta principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity, in the Declaration of Sexual Rights of the World Association for Sexual Health (WAS) and due to the upcoming constitutional and legal reforms in Cuba, members of the Cuban LGBTIQ community have met to promote this agenda.
The document begins by considering that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent to human dignity.
The goal is not only for the text to work as a collective statement but also as a proposal that contributors can continue to feed with ideas and suggestions.
The text also proposes specific lines of action that can be used as a starting point for research and for developing public policies, as Isbel Díaz Torres explains in Havana Times.
The agenda is the first of its kind in Cuba, compiled entirely by members of the public and focuses on the rights of LGTBIQ people.
In addition, it includes 63 specific demands and is divided into two large sections: legislative measures and policies, plans and strategies.
Cuban film director Yaíma Pardo set an important precedent with the demands collected in her documentary Causas y Azares (Causes and Chances, subtitles in English available).
Another precedent was the text written by activist and blogger Alberto Roque.
The documentary highlights numerous analyses regarding the current state of the LGBTQI community's rights in Cuba and the ideological and institutional changes necessary to ensure their full exercise.
Mercedes García and Yasmin Silvia Portales Machado, two activists who participated in the documentary, clarify important points to understand the context for recognizing and protecting Cuba's LGBTIQ community.
In principle, they explain how the Cuban government does not acknowledge the complexity of gender compositions or the diversity of human sexuality.
García assesses Cuba's shortcomings in this regard:
Regrettably, the Socialist social project inherited that discrimination, those false concepts, that ignorance regarding human sexuality; and in Cuba's case, it has taken too long, to my liking, to face that reality and transform it.
Machado expands this point and highlights how the historical and cultural background of Cuba's political ideology prevents distinguishing citizens' diverse lives: Marxism appeared in the West and was a philosophical a white man.
Socialism has failed so far. The Agenda for LGBTIQ rights in Cuba promotes a broad and inclusive debate on human rights and requests that their demands be considered by the National Assembly of People's Power, the Council of Ministers and those who make policies, plans and strategies in Cuba.

Environmental activists cheered when on April 26 the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the government must stop its plans to allow new construction at Pirin National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, without conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment first.
A coalition called For the Nature had brought the lawsuit and hailed the court's decision as an important step in their fight to protect the treasured piece of nature.
According to WWF-Bulgaria, a coalition member:
The plan permits construction on an area that is 12.5-times larger than currently permitted area and could lead to commercial logging affecting nearly 60 per cent of the park (currently no commercial logging is permitted in the park).
Development of the plan has been financed by the EU.
The threat to Pirin National Park has incited a five-month-long wave of protests across Bulgaria and abroad.
The latest round took place in Sofia, Blagoevgrad, Plovdiv, Sliven and London on April 26, in which participants also demanded protection of natural heritage in the Black Sea area.
The court ruling overturned the decision by the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters to accept a draft management plan for Pirin National Park for the period 2014-2020 without a prior Strategic Environmental Assessment, allowing construction of new ski facilities near the town of Bansko.
The activists who initiated the lawsuit say such development will jeopardize the whole park and is in direct violation of EU Directive 2001/42/EO, which requires that an environmental assessment must be made in cases of decisions affecting tourism, forest industry and biodiversity.
The court argued that without conducting the required environmental assessment, "the Ministry had no basis to make a proper estimate whether the actions from the plan would have an impact on the environment or not." The three-judge panel noted that such assessment must be based on the criteria of the Environmental Assessment Regulation, which had not been the case so far.
Even though they briefly celebrated the Supreme Administrative Court ruling, Bulgarian environmental activists are cautious to consider it an end to their struggle to #SavePirin, as they are aware that powerful financial interests would like to claim the land for their tourism projects.
For one, legally the ministry has two weeks to submit an appeal, which would be submitted to a five-judge panel.
Great news for @zazemiata + thousands of people protesting against plans to damage #Pirin national park in Bulgaria! #SavePirin https://t.co/fBM7QtCGGM — Friends of the Earth (@foeeurope) April 30, 2018
Mainstream media in Bulgaria are mostly run by oligarchs and haven't exactly championed the cause, either, presenting protests as insignificant and sparsely attended.
For instance, one recent article calls the activists "the green bribers" (Bul. зелени рушветчии).

Green handkerchief mob at the Congress.
Image from the Facebook page of the National Campaign for the Right to "Safe, Legal and Free Abortion", widely shared online.
On June 13, the members of Argentina's lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, will decide if they will give preliminary approval to a bill that would legalize abortion.
The debate started officially in March this year, a historic milestone in the long struggle for reproductive rights in the country.
For two months, the Chamber of Deputies listened to the different arguments for and against.
The debate period gave way to certain modifications to the bill to gain votes from undecided deputies.
The most significant ones are the possibility for doctors to invoke conscientious objection, although hospitals are obliged to have professionals on staff who would accept to go forward with the procedure.
Also, consent from parents or legal guardians will be required for women under 16.
Meanwhile, another debate has taken place on and offline: every Tuesday since April, several human rights organizations and civil society groups, convened by the National Campaign for the Right to Safe, Legal and Free Abortion, have met in front of Congress with a green handkerchief as a symbol of the struggle.
Their slogan reads: "Sexual education to have a choice, contraception to avoid abortions, legal abortion to avoid death".
There have also been demonstrations against the bill lead by different religious organizations and anti-abortion groups with the motto "Let's save both lives".
On June 13, a vigil is scheduled to take place in front of Congress as the Chamber of Deputies deliberates.
Several polls have pointed to general support for the bill among the population.
Even renowned journalist Eduardo Feinmann, a passionate anti-abortion advocate, made a quick poll on Twitter and wasn't too happy with the results:
"Poll.
Are you for or against legal, safe and free abortions?" .
However, so far an analysis of deputies' voting intention shows a small inclination against legalization.
There are still a lot of undefined votes, though, either because deputies are undecided or are keeping their position private to avoid pressure or threats.
The last day of formal debate featured a strong presentation by Minister of Health Adolfo Rubinstein in support of decriminalization:
We've had 35 years of democracy.
Abortion is a issue that has been swept under the rug. The evidence is solid: decriminalization reduces maternal deaths and the number of abortions.
One way or another, we need to act.
If preliminary approval is granted, the bill will move to the Senate, where for the moment there are many more votes against legalization-for the moment, quite bigger.
This tendency could change, however, according to the result of the debate taking place in the Chamber of Deputies, where those who are undecided play a crucial role.
"I'm just another green handkerchief looking at Congress"
It's impossible to ignore the influence of public opinion, not only in the polls, but also through different personal stories that are being shared online.
In one such testimony, a women talks in detail about the legal and bureaucratic obstacles she had to face when she needed a therapeutic abortion. Without making the names of the doctors public, she describes how some of them refused to help her, and how one of them asked for an unconscionable amount of money in exchange:
My head and my body had not been yet able to restart.
I still had the anxiety of that moment in which, instead of getting the help and the unbiased position I needed from the medical institution and the doctor, I found myself jumping into a void without a net.
Whenever I slept, I had nightmares with Dr. N and Dr. B I can't stop thinking about Dr. B. Especially after seeing him in Congress, arguing in favor of life.
And she concludes:
I feel we've been risking a lot these last days.
Some girlfriends give me strength. they were holding my hand, like on that day I'm just another green handkerchief looking at Congress and asking it to vote in favor of legalizing abortions.
On Twitter, others have also expressed strong opinions and different views in favor of the bill:
The UN defined the criminalization of abortion as a method of torture.
If the law is not approved, those responsable for that torture and the eventual deaths will be the deputies who voted against it.
They will have to carry each and every woman who bleeds to death in their conscience.
Abortion exists, legal or illegal.
"I only support legal abortion in case of rape, if not, let them be screwed for opening their legs", then you don't really care about "both lives" ; what you want is to punish women, don't you think? Legal or illegal abortion, that is the question.
If the law is passed, Argentina would be the second country in Latin America to follow the global trend towards either legalizing or decriminalizing abortion.
The first country in the region to do it was Uruguay in 2012.
As a result, the maternal death rate dropped and has become the second lowest in Latin America.
Let's be like the countries we want to be like.
Without corruption, integrated in the world, with a responsable macro-economy, social protection, political dialogue... and legal abortion.
Bracelets distributed by Beirut Pride.

For the second year in a row, Beirut Pride, in collaboration with other groups supporting and advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, has organized talks and events against hate and discrimination based on gender and sexual diversity.
Beirut Pride 2018 was launched on May 12, with a brunch celebrating "parents who preserved their families, who did not reject their children when they came out as homosexuals, or at least, who sought for family to stay composed."
But this year, Lebanon's General Security barred one schedule Pride event—a play reading—from taking place, alleging that it was being held illegally.
General Security had said it didn't.
The cancelled event was set to take place in Beirut's Zoukak Theater.
Members of General Security and the investigative branch of the police arrived at the theater and stopped a scheduled, free-of-charge reading of and Arabic translation of a French play, Yann Verburgh's "Ogres".
One Beirut Pride organizer, Hadi Damien, was detained for the night, and after pressure from General Security, Beirut Pride decided to suspend its events "for the time being".
Damien spent the night of May 14-15 in Beirut's notorious Hobeiche police station, known for instances of torture such as the one reported by the Lebanese francophone daily L'Orient Le Jour (OLJ), in which a gay couple was arrested, maltreated and tortured in Hobeiche and other detention centers in Lebanon.
According to police sources who spoke to OLJ, Hadi Damien was detained because of an order from Lebanon's public prosecution.
He was given the choice of either signing a contract committing to stop the events of Beirut Pride or of having his case referred to a judge who would interrogate him on the basis of articles "pertaining to the incitement to immorality and to the breach of public morality for coordinating the activities".
On advice from his lawyer, Damien decided that the best option was to sign the pledge, and the Beirut Pride coordinator was then allowed to leave the police station.
On May 15, Beirut Pride released the following statement:
Nobody is now detained, and Beirut Pride is safe.
The events scheduled under the banner of Beirut Pride until May 20, 2018 are suspended for the time being.
We thank you for your concern and empathy, and kindly ask you to refrain from speculating.
We will issue a detailed statement by 9 pm to explain the happening.
The pressuring by the authorities was condemned by civil society organisations.
Proud Lebanon, which works "to achieve protection, empowerment & equality to marginalized groups through community service activities", condemned the silencing peaceful activities, adding that:
Lebanon has always been known for respecting diversity and claims to be an inclusive country for ALL its citizens, despite their differences.
Yet in the past couple of years we are witnessing a total boycott of the LGBTIQ+ movement from expressing loudly and publicly its need of co-existence in a society that should be protective, inclusive and welcoming each and every individual.
The ongoing struggle against homophobia in Lebanon
In Lebanon, homosexual relationships are prohibited on the basis of being "unnatural": Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal code prohibits "any sexual intercourse contrary to the order of nature".
Between 2007 and 2017, however, four judges have found that the law should not apply to consensual sex between adults of the same sex.
But this hasn't stopped widespread abuses by the Lebanese government.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) recently reported that gay men and transgender women in Lebanon have been beaten with electric cables and raped with iron rods.
HRW found that while Lebanese activist groups have had some success in "shaming" the police service's Internal Security Forces by "documenting abuses and publicizing the accounts of victims", General Security was "less susceptible to public pressure, which has made abuses against LGBT people by General Security more difficult to counter."
One 2017's Beirut Pride event was also cancelled because of threats from the League of Muslim Scholars (Ulemas) in Lebanon (هيئة علماء المسلمين في لبنان).
Members of a Christian Orthodox group were also asked to “pray against the threat of homosexuality”
On its website, Beirut Pride calls itself "a collaborative platform that takes a positive stance against hate and discrimination based on gender and sexual diversity.
Beirut Pride is articulated around May 17, the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia."

As a kid reading Arabic-language versions of DC and Marvel comics in Sudan, I believed in superheroes.
But I didn’t understand why none of the superheroes looked like me or had stories to which people like me could relate.
Maybe that’s why I decided to become a cartoonist?
All my childhood feelings came to the surface yesterday on Twitter when I stumbled on the viral video of a man selflessly scaling a four-storey building in less than 20 seconds to save a child, hashtagged #ParisSpiderman.
Refreshing my Twitter feed gave me bits and pieces of the secret identity of the mysterious #ParisSpiderman, then they flooded my Twitter feed.
His name is Mamoudou Gassama and, an undocumented immigrant from Mali.
“This is a much better—and more realistic—plot than Black Panther,” I thought to myself.
While refreshing the hashtag to try to get at this new hero’s origin story, it struck me that his religion was not mentioned, as this is usually the first adjective featured in clickbait headlines and hashtags when an immigrant does something negative.
Within hours, the headlines were reporting that #ParisSpiderman had been invited to meet the French president and that he would be granted citizenship.
A typical zero to hero intro to a superhero story.
With very little light shed on the details of the backstory, it highlighted the stereotypes (black, struggling, poor, ghetto-dwelling), with a quick fast-forward to the climactic scene where the unknown underdog hero saves the child in a public spectacle— and POW!—the introduction of a new “minority” hero, a new addition to the mostly-white superhero line up.
Here’s the missing backstory: Gassama left Mali as a teenager and traveled via , Libya—where he was arrested and beaten—to the coast, where he undertook a perilous boat journey to Italy.
He spent four years in Italy before arriving in France in September 2017 to join his brother.
Without the proper documentation to be in France, he had been sleeping on the floor of a residence for immigrants in Montreuil, outside Paris, rolling out a thin mattress each night and packing it up in the morning.
He shared a cramped room with six others and was, of course, unable to work legally.
So scaling that building was probably one of the easiest things Mamoudou had done in years.
What readers should realize and what the storytellers need to do differently this time is to shed more light on the details of our hero’s life and the real hardships he’d had to endure before he scaled that building to save the child.
Superman, the greatest of superheroes, was an immigrant but he was the “good kind”, the kind that looks “normal” and fits it, and doesn’t get randomly checked or surveilled.
Let the introduction of this new and different superhero make France, and the rest of the world, realize how many superheroes have come in on those boats that are still waiting for their intro scene.
Next issue: Is our hero going to cope with his five minutes of fame?
How is he going manage now that his powers have been discovered?

About 70 percent of Jordan’s population is of Palestinian origin, and they are generally well-integrated into Jordanian society.
Jordanians and Palestinians have been living alongside each other since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and Palestinian Nakba, and even long before that.
However, speak with everyday Palestinians and Jordanians and you might turn up stories that speak to underlying tensions between both groups.
Sara Suod, who is from Madaba, Central Jordan, told Global Voices that her parents would not allow her to visit Palestinian friends:
“I come from Madaba, and my family is extremely proud of that .
So proud that they refused to let my sisters and I visit our Palestinian friends at their houses as children.”
While the time living together has created a sense of peace among the two peoples, complete harmony is still not present.
Marriage and sports are two of the domains where we can still see these tensions more clearly.
Are Jordanian-Palestinian Marriages Still Taboo?
Out of the 82,000 Jordanian women married to foreigners, almost 53,000 are married to Palestinians.
A relatively high figure that could be taken to indicate the normality of Jordanian-Palestinian marriage in Jordan, but that figure can also be misleading.
Stories from Jordanian citizens (whether of Jordanian or Palestinian descent) paint a different picture of Jordanian society regarding these marriages.
Even though the marriage is not exactly taboo, it can range –depending on the area and family—from being normal, to frowned upon, to being utterly forbidden.
Starting with stories of families who are at peace with the issue comes the story of Ahmad Khalil, a Palestinian man, and his Jordanian wife. Regarding their marriage as a successful one, he told Global Voices that:
We met at college, and got engaged after we both finished.
Her family knew from the beginning, and so did mine.
No one objected to anything, and things went quite smoothly throughout the engagement.
Aside from normal, pedantic clashes between the in-laws, no major problems arose. Also, the clashes were never race-related.
I guess it is because my mom is Jordanian, and her uncles are all married to Palestinians, so you can say our families are both equally used to the situation.
Ahmad and his spouse are lucky, and so are the ones who are born into families that are mixed, as the problem of prejudice or racism is minimised by the fact that each individual claims both identities.
However, not everyone has had the same experience as Ahmad.
Speaking of her spouse’s and her own family’s opinion of her marriage to a Palestinian, Sara Majali, a 26-year-old woman from Al-Salt, west central Jordan, tells Global Voices:
Growing up, my family was never particularly strict about my siblings and I marrying a Palestinian, although when I told them that I was, they were not exactly thrilled about it.
They would have rather I married my cousin who also comes from Al-Salt, or at least someone else from it.
My mom opposed the marriage at first, telling me I could find someone ‘closer to us’, but my dad was not as opinionated.
Her mother eventually agreed to the marriage.
My mom eventually agreed to the marriage after months of convincing, but she still does not wholeheartedly bless the marriage.
When my partner and I fight, the first words out of her mouth are always “wouldn’t it have been better if you married…?” and then she mentions the name of any Salt-born man.
She continues:
My partner’s family, although not as aggressively against the marriage as my mom, still gave him a hard time.
Afraid of the fact that I come from a large family, a trait that they think I would use against my husband, they also ironically advised him to find someone ‘closer’ to them.
After 3 years of marriage, they have gotten to know me better, but I still feel that they put borders around my interactions with them—unlike their relationship with my brother in law’s Palestinian wives, who were immediately accepted and treated as a part of the family.
"No spine" is a derogatory way of saying that Palestinian families are not as large and/or as well-connected as the Jordanian ones, implying that a Jordanian man or woman would be more in control of the marriage because they have the family and power to show for it.
That is why many Palestinian families are reluctant about marrying into a Jordanian family, and vice versa.
Rivalries Between Football Fans
Al-Faisaly is one of the Jordanian Football League’s most famous teams and has been taken as a symbol for Jordanian citizens of Jordanian heritage.
Al-Wehdat, named after the 2nd largest Palestinian refugee camp in southeast Amman, is just as famous and is instead a symbol for Jordanian citizens of Palestinian heritage.
While fans usually have a go at each other no matter the team, Jordanians of both heritage usually brace themselves when a game between the aforementioned teams is scheduled.
Cases of assault are common, and have once gotten to the point where 250 fans were injured.
Shops and cars owned by bystanders are often burned for no obvious reason other than to flare the riots.
The police are usually involved, and the two clubs’ managements usually try to discipline their fans by banning anyone who is trying to start a fight between the two—something that does not happen when either of the two teams plays against any other team.
In 2009, a leaked US diplomatic cable said that:
Anti-Palestinian hooliganism and slogans denigrating the Palestinian origins of both the Queen and the Crown Prince led to the cancellation of a July 17 soccer game between the rival Faisali and Wahdat clubs , who traditionally represent the East Banker and Palestinian communities, respectively.
The conclusion can be drawn that the riots, arson, and misconduct is about more than just soccer, it is about what the teams represent: race.
This point is highlighted by Al Wehdat’s own Palestinian President, who has said in one of his interviews with World Soccer:
For Wehdat, 99 per cent of the fans are Palestinian, you won’t find any Jordanian fans of Wehdat.

Shujaat Bukhari, the editor of prominent Kashmiri English daily Rising Kashmir, was shot dead in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, sending shock waves throughout the region.
His vehicle was surrounded by a group of suspected militants who opened fire on him and his security personnel.
Two security personnel later died as a result of their injuries at a hospital.
Bukhari's colleague said that he had just stepped outside his office after finishing his daily work and was heading to break his fast when the attack took place.

Protests for independence (called "azadi") and self-rule in the Kashmir Valley have been active since 1989 and ever since, Jammu and Kashmir has been under Indian military presence with statutes such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the Public Safety Act giving them wide-ranging powers.
The Indian government has officially stated that it believes all of Jammu and Kashmir to be an integral part of India.

Bukhari had worked for several top national and international publications and written hard-hitting articles, never shying away from taking an unpopular stand.
He was special correspondent with The Hindu newspaper from 1997 to 2012 and continued to write for Frontline magazine.
The Press Club of India has expressed its shock and dismay over the incident in the Kashmir valley.
The Editors Guild of India tweeted a statement:
The Editors Guild of India unequivocally condemns the assassination of Rising Kashmir Editor Shujaat Bukhari.
This is a grave attack on press freedom and democratic voices.
We will be issuing a more detailed statement soon — Editors Guild of India (@IndEditorsGuild) June 14, 2018
Condolences are pouring in via social media.
Siddharth Varadarajan, the Editor of the Wire news portal, tweeted:
Shujaat Bukhari and I were colleagues at The Hindu.
He was a formidable reporter, and, as editor of Rising Kashmir, a powerful voice for the embattled media fraternity, a true voice of sanity and reason.
No words of condemnation are enough for the scum who have assassinated him. — Siddharth (@svaradarajan) June 14, 2018
Marvi Sirmed, a member of the executive council of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and special correspondent for the Daily Times Pakistan, tweeted:
Shujaat Bukhari was a voice of reason in Kashmir.
Brilliant journalist who pandered to no extremes.
He did his job honorably till his last breath & paid the price of being upright.
Objectively reported human rights violations at the hands of Indian forces & extremists in Kashmir. — Marvi Sirmed मार्वि ماروی (@marvisirmed) June 14, 2018
This wasn't the first time that Bukhari was targeted.
On July 8, 1996, a militant group abducted 19 local journalists in the Anantnag district and held them as hostages for at least seven hours.
Bukhari was among those abducted.
He was also given police protection after an attack against him in 2000.
Student politician Shehla Rashid tweeted:
Even in a senseless place like Kashmir, the assassination of Mr. Shujaat Bukhari doesn't make sense.
Everyone in the state is asking one question: "Why would anyone want him dead?"
Except the govt which seems to have reached a conclusion

The Ugandan government approved a new tax law that will apply levies to a range of goods and services, including mobile money accounts and social media services such as Facebook and WhatsApp.
It was also popular among local telecom providers, who do not directly benefit from the use of foreign-based “over-the-top” services such as WhatsApp.
In an interview, Ugandan blogger and Global Voices author Pru Nyamishana told BuzzFeed:
one of the two biggest challenges that we face in internet governance is access.
This tax is locking people out....we also believe it is a deliberate move to censor Ugandans and cut down on dissenting voices.
Citing a recent rise in murders and kidnappings, the Ugandan government has also ended a two-month freeze on SIM card sales and ordered telecom companies to register all new mobile SIM cards with the National Biometrics Data Center.
It has banned the sale of scratchable recharge cards as well.
Authorities say violent criminals communicate using unregistered SIM cards in order to plan the attacks without being traced.
While the ban on SIM card sales has been lifted, new regulations will now require Ugandans to provide vendors with their national identification cards so that their personal data can be verified on electronic card readers at the time of purchase.
Under the new law, which goes into effect July 1, customers will also be made to use mobile money accounts in order to recharge their SIM cards.
In a press statement, the Uganda Consumer Protection Association said SIM card regulatory measures would not reduce the crime rate.
Writing about the new tax law, Juliet Nanfuka of the Collaboration on International ICT Policy in East and Southern Africa (CIPESA) called it “the latest in a series of government actions that threaten citizens’ access to the internet.”
Internet shutdown in India’s Tamil Nadu state following massacre of protesters
After police shot and killed 13 civilians at a public demonstration in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, fixed and mobile internet networks were shut down in three districts at the order of local government authorities.
The demonstrators were protesting the expansion of a copper plant that they say is polluting the air and water in their district and putting their health at risk.
Videos of police acting violently or cruelly toward protesters have been circulating on social media, leaving many skeptical of the government’s motivations for cutting off internet access.
According to the Software Freedom Law Center of New Delhi, there have been 55 regional internet shutdowns in India so far in 2018.
Papua New Guinea puts a one-month ban on Facebook, citing ‘fake users’
Officials in the southern Pacific island state of Papua New Guinea will impose a one-month-long ban on Facebook, in what they say is an effort to better understand the platform as a catalyst for the spread of false information.
In an interview with The Guardian, digital media scholar and Global Voices author Aim Sinpeng expressed concern about the ban, but also noted that it would have less impact there than in other parts of the world, given the country’s low proportion of internet users.
Papua New Guinea has a population of just over eight million and an internet penetration rate of only 12 percent.
UAE human rights advocate faces 10 years in prison for social media activism
Emirati human rights advocate Ahmed Mansoor was sentenced to ten years in prison by an Abu Dhabi appeals court for allegedly spreading “hatred and sectarianism” and publishing “false information” on social media.
He was also issued a one million dirham fine (roughly USD $272,000) for “insulting the status and prestige of the UAE.”
Mansoor, who has been held in detention since March 2017, is among a handful of vocal human rights advocates in the Gulf country and received the 2015 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders.
He was also jailed in 2011, after he campaigned for democratic reforms in UAE and signed a pro-democracy petition.
From this time until his most recent arrest, he faced harassment and surveillance both online and off.
With new software, Amazon.com is helping governments surveil US residents
Amazon.com has developed its own facial recognition software, Rekognition, a product the company says can perform “real-time face recognition across tens of millions of faces, and detection of up to 100 faces in challenging crowded photos.”
Through a Freedom of Information Act request, attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union obtained and released emails proving that Amazon has been selling the software to local governments in the US states of Arizona, California and Oregon and that the company had trained and consulted with government officials under a non-disclosure agreement initiated by Amazon.
The organization also co-wrote a coalition letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, demanding that Amazon “stop powering a government surveillance infrastructure that poses a grave threat to customers and communities across the country.”
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Human Rights Watch were among signatories.

A digital illustrated novel tells the stories of Indonesian Chinese who were attacked during the riots that toppled the Indonesian government in 1998.
In May 1998, violent riots erupted across Indonesia demanding the resignation of then President Suharto who had ruled the country for over three decades.
Many Orang Tionghoa (how Indonesians with full or partial Chinese ancestry are called) fled the country because of the escalating violence that targeted them.
A government report released in October 1998 revealed that, while some violent incidents against Indonesian Chinese were spontaneous, most cases appeared to be systematically planned by local thugs supported by powerful political and military forces.
The report also documented cases of rape that victimized many Indonesian Chinese women.
After two decades, victims of the attacks in 1998 and their families continue to seek justice.
Written by Melbourne-based artist Rani Pramesti, the ‘Chinese Whispers’ illustrated novel narrates the tragedy that forced her to flee her beloved country in 1998.
It also features the stories of women who witnessed the 1998 riots.
Global Voices interviewed her about the novel and her motivation for initiating this project:
The Chinese Whispers was inspired by my personal experiences of how the May 1998 racial violence impacted my sense of identity as well as by the historical context of May 1998.
I noticed how 1998 became an important unspoken issue (among) Chinese Indonesian diaspora in Australia.
I can’t speak for other people’s experiences.
But I can speak about mine. My family and I were spared from (the) 1998 looting, rape, and violence but we lived the era where we were subjected to politically motivated racism.
Being raised unequivocally Indonesian, a proud one that is, the 1998 riot questioned my identity.
Through the Chinese Whispers, I want to reveal what politically motivated racism (PMR) could do to people, (and it) doesn’t matter how many years after it happened.
PMR has real human costs, not just in Indonesia but the entire world today.
She explained why she chose the title ‘Chinese Whispers’ for her novel:
During the creative process with the community, we talked about many things and everything.
Yet, when I brought up the events that took place in 1998, of our whereabouts and what not, the voices in the room were reduced to whispers.
As a student of dramatic arts, I learned to observe tones, body languages, expressions.
What I came across during the meetings and dramatic workshops, 1998 held a certain significance to the community. Many said that the 1998 riot is something taboo to talk about.
It remains sensitive, it’s hard to talk about the events, but taboo’s not the word to describe it.
And this is what she hopes her work will accomplish:
One day I attended a poetry reading by Mark Gonzales, one of his poems reads “We cannot heal what we will not face.”
That rang true to me.
20 years on, 1998 is barely acknowledged.
There a lot of things to be done in terms of healing, to obtain some forms of justice.
I’m not only talking about healing at the personal level, but also as a nation.
I want my readers to remember what 1998 entails and to be moved by the experiences of individuals who went through it.
In my work, my 12-year-old persona experienced having her identity torn apart by politically motivated racism.
I love how dramatic arts contributed in telling my personal stories.
One of the pages of the Chinese Whispers.
Currently, the Chinese Whispers is available in Indonesian.
Its English version is due out by the end of 2018.
Rani's work can be found on her website and she can be reached through her Facebook page and Instagram.
Sorry, I don't speak English.

Talking about what it means to migrate can be difficult, but perhaps time or distance enables some to see the migration process more clearly as a whole comprised of a myriad of parts.
Every migration story is unique, but these stories are also connected to things that transcend them and make them equal to other life stories.
Could this advice be of any use to people who find themselves in the process of leaving their homes, or who have already left?
For these people there are no words strong enough to be of any comfort or counsel.
No one is ever fully prepared to leave.
In the Venezuela that I left, I was part of a story shared by a whole group of people who required no explanation from me.
Everything was easy to read: the gestures, the routines, the dangers, the past and the prospects of a future—even if it was clouded by the fog of political instability.
Because personal and group identity were implicit in all our everyday activities, the questions of who am I or who are they did not exist for me.
At that time the rate of emigration from Venezuela had not yet reached the shocking figures that we are seeing today, and leaving still had romantic overtones: going away meant automatically doing well in that new land.
The Venezuela that started to build itself in exile back in 1999 was very much misunderstood by the Venezuela that was left behind.
Grievances on the part of the emigrants in the face of their new living situation were not accepted by their fellow compatriots who, at the same time, were beginning to suffer what is recognized today as the worst political, economic and humanitarian crisis in the contemporary history of Venezuela.
Because of this, emigrants were losing a say in matters: their political opinions of their country were minimized due to the distance and because the difficulties that stemmed from their change of life were not accepted as such.
The belief that a new country offered a life devoid of real difficulties, at least in comparison with the difficulties faced by those back in Venezuela, filled the imaginations of those watching them from home.
And at the same time, the country receiving these immigrants did not consider the newcomers' criticism valid, far less accept them as true political actors.
The others, foreign realities and impenetrable worlds
I did not know any of the things I'm reflecting upon now when I first arrived in the United States in the summer of 2011.
At that time there was very little that I could say apart from some greetings and the necessary apology for not speaking English.
(The option of calling friends who were still in Venezuela to get things off my chest was not an option). In order to establish any new communication, I needed my husband's help to write, read and translate what I was saying to to other people and then, in turn, translate what they were saying to me.

This is a stark contrast with the young woman who stopped in front of my camera and posed without me even having to ask her to do so.

This fear resulted in self-confinement at home, coupled with endless hours of total isolation.
When someone leaves his or her home country, even the most insignificant incident that occurs in contact with this other outside world can have an immense demoralizing power that can plunge anyone into the deepest of insecurities.
Hiding away is, therefore, one of the possible paths one can take, and this was precisely the one that I chose for quite some time.
During this time of confinement, the windows of my home became my favorite camera.
These wide openings in the walls gave me the chance to get closer to the social dynamics that I considered impenetrable.
Part of the fascination with observing others lies in the questions that arise from this encounter with a foreign reality.
Likewise, the nature of the answers that emerge from such questions has the power to raise more unanswered questions.
By observing, wondering and reacting, I learned that the people I was observing were all very different from one another.
While this world rich in differences was flourishing and expanding, my personal identity was diminishing.
I was no longer seen as me, a person from the city of Barquisimeto, but instead as a person from Venezuela.
I even fell into a category that was as new as it was incomprehensible: I was a latina, the label that is supposed to define someone from Tierra del Fuego as being no different from someone from the city of Juárez in Mexico.
But I did gain something from all it: I realized that, almost without fail, neither the Venezuelans from here or from there, nor the Americans from anywhere in the country, reject the stories or products that come from encountering a photo or a photographer.
This was something I learned when I decided to stop watching through my window and went out for the first time with my camera for company.
And now the camera comes with me every time.
Snippets of the world
There is something transgressive in the simple act of taking a photograph.
The image captured is the small trophy of a shrewd petty thief who becomes the owner of a snippet of the world that has been frozen.
The space of the streets contracts and all gestures become important, but for the purpose of recognizing the ones that would make me want to hide, but instead to try and gather them, to collect and understand them all in the still of the night, when reviewing the remaining photographs from the day.
I, who had remained cooped up for a number of years, all of a sudden found the courage to go out and face people with my camera.
When I was able to start reading, the short texts that appeared along the way were included in the scenes of some of the people on the street, something that served as a base and support to enhance these images.

Even when my ability to communicate was still very limited, people would come and ask me to take their photographs.
Having this kind of control in a situation like this, in which an individual belonging to this indifferent world, someone that in another time would have passed before my window without seeing me, is looking me directly in the eye, was a new way of experiencing being an immigrant.
It was also a small victory in the face of the insecurities with which all immigrants have to live.
As a Venezuelan, and through my camera, I have built an image of the United States for myself—and for my own survival as well.
Sharing my images made it possible for me to get back to communicating by using a language that depended more on gestures than it did on voice.
By using a camera I learned how to read this, my new world.
I learned to speak, only not English or Spanish, but Photography.
And most importantly, I learned how to be looked in the eye once again.
Photography was the bridge by which I discovered that I am the "other" in this country, but also that difference is good; so much so that there is nothing that can't be photographed, nothing that does not warrant the telling of a new story.

Netizen Report: Who will be next?

Online censorship and repression of social media users are reaching new heights in Venezuela, where citizens continue to protest dire economic and public health conditions wrought by the country’s ongoing political crisis.
It has become extraordinarily difficult for journalists to report the news, as they face regular accusations of “disturbing public order” or “threatening the revolution”.
Social media users who actively engage with a broad public on various civic issues are also being targeted.
In mid-May, popular Twitter user Pedro Jaimes, who offered climate, meteorological and air traffic reports to nearly 80,000 followers, went missing.
Shortly before his disappearance, Jaimes had tweeted about the pathway of an airplane carrying Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, information that is available to the public through online news outlet Efecto Cocuyo.
On June 15, more than a month after he went missing, Jaimes called family members to inform them that he had been detained inside El Helicoide, the military facility turned prison belonging to the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN).
Meanwhile, accessing basic information and communication platforms online is becoming ever-more difficult.
With electrical grids faltering for lack of maintenance and periodically deactivated in an effort to ration energy, internet access is never a guarantee.
Yet web-based news and communication systems are increasingly the only way that Venezuelans can exchange and obtain information independent of the state.
In early June, the websites of two major news outlets, La Patilla and El Nacional, were blocked, along with access points for the Tor Network, which enables internet users to circumvent online censorship.
Major pornography websites have been blocked as well, in what may be an attempt to test the country’s online censorship capacity.
In some countries, these types of measures have been a precursor to efforts to increase online censorship.
Palestinian journalists targeted with assault, mobile phone seizure
Journalists covering a labor rights protest in Gaza on June 19 reported to MADA (the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedom) that they were assaulted and had their mobile phones and cameras either confiscated or destroyed by uniformed people associated with the Hamas movement, which rules the Gaza Strip.
At a June 15 protest in the West Bank city of Ramallah, journalists reported that Palestinian Authority security forces used similar tactics in an effort to stop them from filming and reporting on the protest.
Nigerian student suspended for lamenting school’s poor infrastructure
Kunle Adebajo, a law student at Nigeria’s University of Ibadan, was suspended for two semesters for writing an article that was deemed critical of the university administration.
On April 20, Kunle Adebajo wrote an opinion article, “UI: The irony of fashionable rooftops and awful interiors”, which described the deplorable state of infrastructure in student residences in his university.
University administrators then summoned Adebajo to a disciplinary panel, which described Adebayo's article as “rude, defamatory and insubordinate” and issued his suspension.
In an article for Sahara Reporters, Fisayo Soyombo, an award-winning investigative journalist and an alumnus of University of Ibadan, described the disciplinary action against Adebajo as “a clear uppercut on press freedom.”
Cuban authorities revoke press credentials from renowned blogger
Veteran blogger and former BBC correspondent Fernando Ravsberg, an Uruguayan journalist who has made his home in Cuba since the late 1990s, was denied press credentials by Cuban media regulators for the first time.
Ravsberg had long used earnings from his work as an accredited foreign journalist to support his popular blog “Cartas desde Cuba” (Letters from Cuba), where he writes critical commentary about public life and politics in Cuba, and where a single post regularly garners hundreds of comments from readers.
Ravsberg reflected on the move in his own words:
Over these past 10 years, they have tried to tame me with kind words of advice, hidden threats, with breaking my teeth, demanding that I be expelled from the country, and ‘warnings’ directed at my children.
None of this has worked until now, but removing my foreign media credentials has allowed them to give Cartas a coup de grace.
In Nicaragua, pro-government forces seem to be changing peoples’ WiFi network names
With anti-government protests still raging in Nicaragua, hundreds of people reported in mid-June that their SSID (their Wi-Fi network names) had spontaneously changed in the middle of the night.
All of those reporting the change were subscribers to Claro, a subsidiary of the Mexican telecommunications giant América Móvil.
This message has been used consistently, and as a social media hashtag, by government actors and supporters online.
Barricades have been popping around the country in an effort to pressure President Daniel Ortega to leave power and protect communities from state violence.
A mobile phone access initiative is offering free mobile phones to female heads of household living below the poverty line in the northeast Indian state of Chhattisgarh.
An investigation by independent news site Scroll.in showed that participants have not been told how the government might use their Aadhaar numbers.

The Advox Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world.
With elections approaching in July, Cambodia’s National Election Committee has published a set of plans intended to monitor and control online news.
A new inter-ministry working group, formed to investigate media outlets deemed to be spreading “fake news”, has put forth a new regulation that bans journalists from including “personal opinion or prejudice” in their reporting, publishing news that “affects political and social stability”, conducting interviews at polling stations or broadcasting news that could sow “confusion and loss of confidence” in the election.
Violations are punishable by fines of up to USD $7,355.
The Ministry of Information will be empowered to censor websites and social media pages found in violation of the regulation.
Internet service providers will be required to install software that enables the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to “easily filter or block any websites, accounts or social media pages that are deemed illegal”.
After receiving crippling tax bills, the Daily ceased its operations in September 2017, while the Post's owner sold the newspaper.
The publication now belongs to Sivakumar S Ganapathy, who is the managing director of a Malaysia-based ASIA PR company that has worked on behalf of Cambodia’s ruling party and Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Meanwhile in Tanzania, a much-maligned “blogger tax” goes into effect on June 15, and will require bloggers and independent website owners to register and pay roughly $900 USD per year to publish online.
The extremely popular Jamii Forums — which has been dubbed both the “Tanzanian Reddit” and “Swahili Wikileaks” — has shut itself down last week on grounds that the law creates insurmountable regulatory barriers for sites like Jamii.
Reporters Without Borders has called on the government to scrap the new regulation.
Bangladeshi secular writer and activist assassinated in public
Bangladeshi secular writer Shahzahan Bachchu was shot and killed near his home town of Munshiganj.
Bachchu was known as an outspoken activist for secularism, and printed poetry and books on humanism and free thought.
He was reportedly dragged out of a pharmacy and gunned down by men on motorcycles.
Bachchu’s death follows a series of attacks on humanists and freethinkers in Bangladesh, including the murders of writers and digital advocates Avijit Roy, Washiqur Rahman, Ananto Bijoy Das and Niloy Neel, among others. In the past, government officials including the prime minister Sheikh Hasina have blamed the attacks on atheists for criticizing religion.
Algerian blogger gets 10 years in prison for video interview
Algerian blogger Merzoug Touati was sentenced to ten years in prison in late May for reporting online about austerity strikes, job protests, and human rights violations.
Touati, who has been in jail since January 2017, was convicted of providing “intelligence to agents of a foreign power likely to harm Algeria’s military or diplomatic position or essential economic interests” after posting an interview with an Israeli official online.
Touati is expected to appeal the sentence.
Facebook user in India arrested for complaining about poor infrastructure
A man from Kerala, India was arrested by police after writing a Facebook post about a damaged road, calling on a local politician to repair it.
The politician alleged that the post was “defamatory” and that insulted her gender and religion.
She filed a complaint with police who subsequently made the arrest.
The man was released on bail shortly afterward.
Russian journalist forced to resign over Instagram comments
Russian reporter Alexandra Terikova was forced to resign for posting an Instagram video of kindergarten students singing a song for Russian President Vladimir Putin and then giving an interview about the video to an independent channel.
The video was posted alongside a sarcastic hashtag and a message critical of the jingoistic tone of the song.
A death sentence and a viral video mark the end of Telegram in Iran An Iranian man is facing the death penalty for posts made on his Telegram app channel, where he allowed users to freely post their opinions.
Hamidreza Amini will go to trial on June 25 on charges of “insulting the prophet”, “insulting the supreme leader”, “acting against national security”, “propaganda against the state” and “disturbing public opinion”.
Amini was held in solitary confinement and interrogated without access to legal counsel after his arrest.
He went on hunger strike on June 3 to protest his conditions and was hospitalized but then transferred back to prison before receiving adequate treatment, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran.
The Iranian Judiciary issued an order on April 30 to block Telegram on national security grounds.
Since then, a parody song about the filtering of Telegram by the Iranian musical group DasandazBand has gone viral on social media, poking fun at government attempts to get Iranians to adopt the state-owned messaging platform Soroush platform.
Leading news sites blocked in Venezuela
Two Venezuelan news outlets that have managed report on the country’s ongoing political and economic crises for the past four years were knocked offline on major state-affiliated internet service provider networks during the first week of June.
Anecdotal evidence and technical testing confirmed that both La Patilla and El Nacional were inaccessible on CANTV, the country’s largest telecommunications provider, which is controlled by state authorities.
The block followed a court-issued fine of one billion Venezuelan Bolivares (about USD $10,000) against El Nacional, on claims by the state that the newspaper had inflicted “moral damages” on United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) Vice President Diosdado Cabello, when he served as president of the National Assembly.
Pakistani political party website blocked
Ahead of elections in Pakistan on July 25, the website of a political party named Awami Workers Party was blocked on multiple ISPs in Pakistan for at least three days.
Despite writing to election commission and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (which is responsible for the blocking), party officials have been given no explanation for the block.
Brazil Electoral Court kicks off new fake news regulation
On June 7, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) ordered Facebook to take down "untruthful information about candidate Marina Silva" within 48 hours of the ruling.
This was the first time that an injunction has been issued based on a 2017 resolution intended to regulate the spread of disinformation during the 2018 elections.
The court ruled in favor of the presidential candidate and her political party Rede, which challenged five links posted in 2017 by the right wing page "Partido Anti-PT" (the Anti-Worker's Party, in Portuguese) claiming Silva was being investigated by Operation Car Wash, a major money-laundering investigation involving more than 100 Brazilian oil executives and politicians.
There have been no formal accusations of corruption against Silva.
The page has more than 1.7 million followers.
Will France get a “fake” news bill?
The French parliament started debating a government-proposed bill aimed at curbing the “manipulation of information” in the three-month period preceding an election.
The law would allow candidates to complain about the dissemination of false information about them online and judges will have 48 hours to decide on a case.
During a parliamentary session discussing the bill on 7 June, leftwing and rightwing MPs from the opposition slammed the bill.

World Environment Day was celebrated on June 5, as it has been every year since 1974.
The plastic litter can clog up drainage channels, increasing city flooding, and end up in lakes and oceans, where fish consume them, becoming a health risk to both aquatic life and humans.
In rural areas, many of the plastics end up in farmlands and gardens which affects the way crops grow because they block proper flow of water and air.
Uganda has tried to ban plastic bags (popularly known as kaveera), but implementation has been spotty because of lobbying by manufacturers, disagreement among politicians and a lack of public awareness about the need for the ban.
On the website Earth Finds Uganda, author Baz Waiswa summarized in 2016:
But in April 2015, despite numerous callous demonstration from members of private sector, including court battles, the Ministry of Water and Environment under National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) effected the ban on importation, manufacture and use of polythene bag of gauge below 30 microns.
The implementation however has not been a rosy one as affected businesses and other government agencies including cabinet fought the ban calling for its suspension.
This back and forth has left the public in a state of indecision.
Some traders stopped packing customer purchases in the kaveera while others continued to use the ban substance despite threats of legal action from NEMA.
This year on World Environment Day, President Yoweri Museveni ordered 45 plastic manufacturers to stop making polythene bags, once again trying to give teeth to the ban.
It remains to be seen if this time it sticks.
In Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city, plastic litter can prevent the flow of waste water.
The Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has made an effort to provide street dustbins, do garbage collection in a more frequent manner, and encourage recycling by signing a memorandum of understanding with Coca Cola to increase what people earn from collecting plastic waste, from $0.05 per kilogram to $0.13.
This year, for World Environment Day, the environmental conservation group Little Hands Go Green visited different schools in eastern Uganda to teach children the dangers of using plastic bags:

Alongside scores of independent blogs and social media pages, Tanzania's most popular independent news and user comment site, Jamii Forum, have shut themselves down in anticipation of the country's soon-to-be-implemented "blogger tax."
On June 15, 2018, Tanzanian bloggers will have to register and pay over $900 USD per year to publish online.
If blogs and other types of online content, such as YouTube channels, operate after June 15 without a license, they may be punished by a fine “not less than five million Tanzanian shillings” (around $2,500 USD), or imprisonment for “not less than 12 months or both.”
While the registration fee and subsequent fines are steep, many bloggers say the concern is not just about the money but also about the complexity and ambiguity of obliging the new regulations.
Since the directive was first issued by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) on March 16, 2018, Tanzanian bloggers and civil society organizations have responded actively to the new regulations in a variety of ways.
A coalition of the Legal and Human Rights Centre and other civil society organisations including Tanzania Human Rights Defenders, Media Council of Tanzania, Jamii Media, Tanzania Media Women Association and Tanzania Editors Forum created a petition which was presented at the Mtwara High Courts on May 4.
The judge asked the team to resubmit their petition on technical grounds, during which time they secured a temporary injunction until May 28.
However, their case was ultimately dismissed with the judge arguing that "the organizations failed to demonstrate how they would be affected by the regulations."
Tanzanian bloggers have creatively protested against the new blogging regulations, openly commenting on the blogging regulations online.
Aikande Kwayu, who has blogged particularly about Tanzanian politics and the 2015 elections (and also writes book reviews and flash fiction) suspended her website on May 1 in an act of protest.
Mtega, a tech and development blog owned by Ben Taylor who resides in the United Kingdom, invited Tanzanian bloggers to write guest posts on his blog.
Chambi Chachage handed ownership of his blog Udadisi ("Curiosity" in Swahili) on April 27 to Takura Zhangazha, who resides in Zimbabwe.
And Elsie Eyakuze put her blog The Mikocheni Report on hold, taking a break to become a "digital refugee":
Yes.
In December 2016, Tanzanian police arrested Maxence Melo, co-founder, and director of Jamii Forums, for refusing to disclose information on its members, a demand made under the Cybercrimes Act.
On June 12, Elsie Eyakuze tweeted with a reference to how social media has connected people offline in Tanzania, as well as Jamii Forums' significant role as a platform for whistleblowers leaking documents related to corruption:
I mean.
People were leaking documents like whoa all through the forum.
Way pre Mange Kimambi.
Never imagined I would end up meeting Mike and Max.
They smiled more easily then.
We were all so much younger!
Then I met you all.
In an interview, Jamii Forum founder Maxence Melo told The Citizen: "It is obvious that our platform was being targeted when this regulation was formulated."
The $900 USD annual license fee is a substantial amount of money in a country where nearly one-third of the population still live in extreme poverty.
The requirement to register platforms and obtain a tax clearance certificate may be a bureaucratic hurdle as most bloggers are individuals without registered companies.
Blog and online media owners are first required to be granted a license, and then, to make matters more complicated, they must adhere to a rather complex set of regulations.
On June 12, Aikande Kwayu elaborated in a tweet:
I also think the problem is not the payment as much as the subsequent responsibility following the license (if granted).
On April 12, Ben Taylor explained some of these complexities, highlighting that the regulations require a blog owner "must be able to identify everyone who posts content", and a blog owner "must cooperate with law enforcement officers" in relation to these regulations.
A screenshot of TCRA regulations detailing questions and definitions related to the new law shared on Twitter.
Taylor suggests that this could entail "demands to reveal the identity of anyone posting on your site, making anyone who posts anonymous comments on blogs, newspaper sites or web forums vulnerable to having their identity exposed."
In Tanzania, political tensions have risen over the past few years.
Since the presidential elections in 2015, Tanzania's opposition has been restricted by a ban on opposition rallies and the stifling of independent media, sanctions, intimidation, and punishment of citizens for criticising President John P. Magufuli of the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM, Swahili for "Revolutionary Party").
The country's Cybercrimes Act, passed in 2015, has played a significant role in stifling dissent.
In 2015 and 2016 alone, at least 14 Tanzanians were arrested and prosecuted under the law, for insulting the president on social media.
Tanzania is not the only country taking control of its citizens' use of online media in recent months.
Uganda and Kenya have recently issued new online restrictions to content production and regulation.

This week, we're looking back at seven years of covering global digital rights news in celebration of our 300th edition!
We have covered the digital rights ramifications of social movements from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Venezuela, attacks on digital activism from Cuba to Bahrain to Tanzania, and internet-focused legislation in more than 100 countries on every continent.
‘Netizen’ is not just a clever portmanteau
The term first came into use in mainland China, where online communities began to refer to themselves as wǎngmín (网民, literally "net-citizen") and wǎngyǒu (网友, literally "net-friend").
Beyond the clever wordplay, these communities built spaces where people could speak up, criticize and debate in a way that was not possible in Chinese society.
Netizens intentionally identified themselves as active citizens on the internet, in sharp contrast to their existence in real life.
In countries like Ethiopia, Morocco and Syria our team has followed the trials and prison terms of bloggers and online activists whose work sparked widespread change for their communities and triggered enduring legal threats from their own governments.
We are not writing about digital rights in principle or in theory — we are writing about how they play out for real people.
Week after week, our team of volunteers work to show how online expression has become a formidable force in public life and how this empowers communities and political movements alongside state and other powerful actors.
Over time, our reports have tracked how one sweeping event — an environmental disaster, a refugee crisis, a violent attack — can trigger a wave of reaction that results in threats to online rights around the world.
And we have followed the remarkably global trends in legal repression of speech that affect so many people around the world, but don’t always make the headlines.
Here are some of our all-time favorite editions of the Netizen Report, showing the range and depth of our work since 2011.
Working in the public interest can get you arrested: Digital activists under fire
The rights of an individual speaking truth to power lie at the core of Global Voices’ advocacy work.
Week after week, we have covered threats against freedom of speech, ranging from arrests of the #Istanbul10 activists in Turkey to prosecution of the Zone9 bloggers in Ethiopia to multiple years of fatal attacks on bloggers in Bangladesh.

Post-Charlie chilling effects: Censorship in the name of national security
The Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris sparked critical debate over the importance of free expression, and led several governments in the EU and beyond to restrict free speech and increase their surveillance powers.
"I am Charlie ... and I am Muslim."
In ‘state of emergency’, internet shutdowns leave citizens struggling to connect
Political upheaval and public protest in many countries has triggered a “state of emergency”, justifying the suspension of many fundamental rights and enduring internet shutdowns.
This edition focused on Ethiopia and Venezuela, just two of the many countries where shutdowns have occurred.
We've also covered internet and social media shutdowns in China, Syria, Pakistan, Cameroon, Iran, Togo, India, Iraq, Egypt, Gabon, D. R. Congo, Somalia, and Sudan.

Activists demand answers from Facebook
As a community of writers and activists, we’ve faced censorship, harassment and direct threats because of our activism on Facebook since the early days of the platform.
The Netizen Report archive shows countless examples of discrimination and harassment on the platform, highlights our in-depth research on Free Basics (Facebook’s project to create an “internet on ramp” for people in developing countries), and has documented the uproar from activists demanding answers from the platform following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.

With an ever-evolving team of writers, researchers, activists and human rights experts from 41 countries (full list below) and the steadfast support of Global Voices editors, we’ve produced 300 editions of the Netizen Report since 2011.
This week on Twitter, join us in raising a virtual glass to our collective efforts.
Here’s to many more years of capturing the global story of human rights and internet!
Yours truly,

A Lebanese journalist was convicted in absentia of defaming acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Gebran Bassil in a Facebook post.
A court in the western Lebanese city of Baabda sentenced Fidaa Itani to four months in prison and a fine of 10 million Lebanese lira (roughly USD $6660) on June 29, 2018.
Fidaa Itani is a journalist who focuses on Syria and the refugee crisis.
The Facebook post in question leveraged a complex critique of political and military actions by various powerful actors in Lebanon.
Itani decried raids carried out by the Lebanese army in Arsal last year, which resulted in the death of Syrian citizens in detention.
He also criticized the continuous nationalist push for the forced removal of refugees on Lebanese territories.
Itani went on to express concern about the Lebanese political party and militant group Hezbollah.
Itani has publicly opposed Hezbollah's military intervention in Syria on behalf of the Assad regime.
Shortly thereafter, lawyers for the army and the presidency filed a lawsuit against Itani.
On top of this, he began receiving direct threats from people associated with Hezbollah.
In short order, he fled the country and sought exile in the UK.
In an interview with the francophone Lebanese newspaper L'Orient le Jour, Itani explained that the original suit, filed by lawyers claiming to represent the Lebanese president and the army, seems to have vanished and now been replaced by the case brought by Gebran Bassil.
I don't know how the first legal action disappeared, nor what was cooked with the case between services of the military intelligence and the president of the republic, or even Hezbollah.
Although it seems that Gebran Bassil volunteered to institute an action in their stead.
Itani also said that he had not received official confirmation of the sentence, and only heard the news from media reports.
He also told Maharat Foundation, a free speech NGO, that acting Minister Bassil has filed a total of nine cases against him, including this one.
Reacting on both Facebook and Twitter, Fidaa Itani was unsurprisingly critical of the judge's decision.
Sharing an article citing his prison sentence, he commented: "More repression and more robberies."
The sentence of Itani was reported, criticized and denounced by some Lebanese and international organizations.
In an email sent to reporters, Bassam Khawaja, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch, said:
Sentencing a journalist to four months in prison for a critical Facebook post is an outrageous attack on free speech that lays bare the lack of meaningful protections for freedom of expression in Lebanon.
Lebanon’s new parliament should act quickly to abolish laws that criminalize defamation, which are disproportionate, unnecessary, and violate international human rights law.
Indeed, Lebanon's penal code criminalizes defamation and makes special provisions against insulting the president, the flag, and other public officials.
The country's military code criminalizes "insulting the flag or army".
These offenses all are punishable with fines and prison time, and offer no special exception for journalistic work.
According to Freedom House 2016 Report on Lebanon:
Lebanese journalists complain that media laws are chaotic, contradictory, and ambiguously worded.
Provisions concerning the media, which justify the prosecution of journalists, can be found in the penal code, the Publications Law, the 1994 Audiovisual Media Law, and the military justice code.
Rising pressure on free expression in Lebanon
In Lebanon's legal landscape, court cases against journalists are not a new phenomenon, but such incidents have multiplied in recent months, with a smattering of charges against journalists, TV show hosts, and commentators.
On January 24, 2018, TV comedy show host Hisham Haddad was prosecuted for making jokes at the expense of Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman.
In March 2018, the owner of the website Lebanon Debate was sentenced to six months in prison and was ordered to pay 10 million Lebanese Lira, after being found guilty of libel in a case brought by the Director General of Customs.
In November 2017, prominent Lebanese TV host Marcel Ghanem was prosecuted for obstruction of justice after he resisted charges brought against two of his guests, both Saudi journalists, who denounced Lebanese President Aoun and Minister Bassil of being "Hezbollah's partner in terrorism."
The case against Ghanem was dropped.
In another article written by L'Orient Le Jour, Marcel Ghanem was reported saying that the arrests of journalists and their convictions was the result of "muzzling practiced by the ruling powers under the cover of the struggle against terrorism or Israel".
But public prosecutors are not the only legal entities bringing charges of defamation and libel against media workers.
On January 10, 2018, the Lebanon's notoriously harsh military court sentenced in absentia Lebanese journalist and researcher Hanin Ghaddar for defaming the Lebanese army at a conference held in the USA in 2014.
Her sentence was later overturned.
Ten days later, military intelligence summoned human rights defender Ovada Yousef over Facebook posts.
Yousef told Human Rights Watch that he was detained by the military and police for four days.
Maharat Foundation, a media and free speech NGO, has called for Lebanese judicial authorities to take into account the right of criticism against public persons:
Maharat also calls on the new parliament to speed up the reforms it has introduced with the MP Ghassan Mukhaiber, notably the abolition of the prison sentence and the preventive detention of anyone expressing his opinion by any means, including the Internet, and broadening the concept of public criticism.
Time will tell if their initiative amounts to real change in the country's free speech environment.
With five votes for and three against, the judges of Ecuador's Constitutional Court have recognized the right to identity of children with same-sex parents in what is known in the country as the Satya Case.
Satya is the child of Nicola Rothon and Helen Bicknell, two British women living in Ecuador who are in a civil union and conceived their child through artificial insemination.
However, Satya's birth in 2012 brought with it a legal battle.
In Ecuador, as in other Hispanic countries, it is customary for people to have two surnames: in the case of heterosexual couples, one last name from the paternal side and one from the maternal side.
But when Rothon and Bicknell tried to register their child with both of their surnames, the Civil Registry of Ecuador refused.
Six years later, after legal complaints, debates, and numerous discussions across citizen and traditional media, the court decided in early June 2018 that the Civil Registry must register Satya with the last names of both her mothers.
The decision prompted many different reactions online.
Across websites like Medium, for example, observers theorized that Satya's story will echo throughout civil rights history in Ecuador.
Human rights expert Patricio Benalcázar Alarcón highlighted that the reactions of the Civil Registry workers were a reflection of how the case challenged the heteronormative standards that had been accepted as "natural" throughout the country's history:
The Constitutional Court performing this extraordinary act of protection is an important and transformative step taken in light of cultural, judicial, ideological, and political structures that that support a system of discrimination for their part, Satya, Helen, and Nicola, through their dream of having the simple and tender happiness of a family, broke barriers of exclusion and established the legitimate presence of the diverse human condition.
One case of many
Same-sex parent families do exist in Ecuador, but their invisibility in the law causes constant problems.
If, for example, one of the parents dies and the child does not share the surviving parent's last name, that parent loses all parental rights to the child as they are not legally registered as parent and child.
This reality can even result in the child being put up for adoption by the state.
The consequences of parents splitting up can mean the loss of parental rights, and access to alimony, visitation, and more can be limited due to the legal rights of inheritance and identity.
Overall, these uncertainties are a result of the fact that same-sex families do not have equal rights before the law.
Thus, from the editors of the website Andes, the decision of the court is significant:
It is, furthermore, a way of recognizing a social situation that does, in fact, occur, in which ignorant officials do nothing but take away boys, girls, and teenagers who are raised in non-conventional households where they do not experience the protection they should from the sate, society, or family to achieve their full development.
Other analysts who study the Satya case argue that its relevance has yet to be seen:
The Satya case has an importance we still can't measure.
Here we put it in context.
Only the beginning
It appears that the court's ruling would be solely for this case, and the National Assembly will have one year to create new legislation surrounding this loophole.
For now, public apologies from the Civil Registry as expected, as well as sanctions to the workers who refused to register Satya.
Those following the case expect that the legislative body would use the ruling of the Satya case as a guide to set a new standard to be recognized for the country's constitution, the right to identity, equality in front of the law, and the main points of interest of the case: the rights of children who are part of same-sex parent families.
Beginning with a constitutional referendum in 2008, the legal framework for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community in Ecuador has expanded over the last several years.
That reform recognized diverse families in a broad sense, the difference between identity and sexual orientation, and universal civil unions, amongst other things.
Still, after a decade with the new Ecuadorian constitution in place, societal norms still exist that discriminate against members of the LGBTI community and keep them from exercising their rights, making them less visible.
In the case of the latter, they say the reason for their opposition is not because of religious reasons, but "anthropological reasons": they seek to defend the "respect of the laws of nature" and the "balance" that comes from the education given by families made by a man and a woman.
They aspire for Ecuador to join the global trend in which equality is becoming the norm through the formal recognition of the rights of all people, especially those not acknowledged in patriarchal or heteronormative societies, and whose rights could be threatened by the law.
Danilo Marzano, a member of the LGBTI community who was interviewed for the documentary during one of the rallies to support Satya, Nicola, and Helen, said:
In reality, is more a collective desire than an individual one.
We need to be included in the same constitutional benefits as first-class citizens.
It is not only the Satya case important to legally recognize the rights of families with same-sex parents; that both men and women in the LGBTI population could have the right to shape our own families right to develop our own individual freedom to love supposedly so advanced so progressive. has not been true.
The defense of these rights takes on more importance in the face of the findings of the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (NISC), which reveal alarming levels of discrimination and violence: "Of all of the members of the LGTBI community interviewed, 70.9% reported that they had experienced discrimination in their home environment."
And of that percentage, "72.1% have experienced being controlled, 74.1% have experienced some kind of imposition, 65.9% have suffered from rejection, and 61.4% from violence."
This article was written with the help of fellow Global Voices author Daniela Gallardo, who has been following the Satya case for Global Voices from its start in 2012 through its development in 2014.
Liberal, pluralistic, democratic, peaceful, free, fair, and non-violent.
These were the words used by a Cambodian state-affiliated press office to describe how the government will conduct the general election scheduled to take place on July 29, 2018. Campaigning starts on July 7.
A video produced by the Press and Quick Reaction Unit of the Office of the Council of Ministers even boasted that the upcoming election “could be considered one of the best Election (sic) in Cambodia’s history.”
The video was likely intended to address the criticism from local and global civil society groups with respect to the deteriorating state of democracy in Cambodia.
The Cambodian People's Party has been in power for 33 years under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is considered to be Southeast Asia’s longest-serving head of state.
The video suggests that, contrary to what critics have been saying in international forums, the election is open to all candidates.
It even includes a speech by Hun Sen directing officials to assist all registered political parties during the campaign period.
But the key word there is "registered."
Indeed, it is true that registered parties are free to participate in the elections.
But the country’s main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was dissolved by the Supreme Court in November 2017, after Hun Sen accused it of conspiring with foreign countries to topple his government.
CNRP’s top leaders have either fled the country or are currently detained, and its members of parliament were removed from their posts and banned from running for public office for five years.
The video even makes a claim that Cambodia offers a lesson to other countries on how to promote pluralism, pointing to the fact that in 2013, there were only eight parties competing in the general election.
The government today has registered 20 political parties.
The video also highlights the presence of international observers who can visit polling places without any restrictions.
The government said 50,000 observers were invited and 300 journalists from 35 institutions were accredited for this year’s election.
But the video fails to mention that in May 2018, the government issued a code of conduct for election observers which media groups said would restrict the work of journalists.
The code of conduct prohibits journalists from expressing "personal opinion or prejudice" or conducting unauthorized interviews at polling booths.
The code also criminalizes the broadcasting of news that could cause "confusion and loss of confidence" in the election.
In response to the rule, the International Federation of Journalists said, “These latest guidelines have robbed Cambodians of any chance of vital information to make informed political decisions.”
In another part of the video, the election is touted as a peaceful event “free from rhetoric quarrel.”
The video does not mention the inter-ministerial prakas (regulation) issued on May 28, 2018, that expanded web and social media control in the country.
The new directive mandates several government agencies to block websites with content considered as "incitement, breaking solidarity, discrimination and willfully creating turmoil leading to undermining national security, public interest and social order."
More than 116 civil society groups based in Cambodia signed a statement criticizing the prakas, arguing that it "threatens the privacy rights and freedom of expression of every single internet and social media user in Cambodia and further diminishes the limited space left for public debate following months of attacks on media freedoms."
The statement further reads:
The order can be used to stifle all forms of public discussion in Cambodia.
Virtually any opinion which authorities consider unacceptable could fall under its vague, sweeping criteria such as “breaking solidarity” or “undermining social order”.
Aside from attacking the opposition, the Hun Sen government was also accused of undermining free speech after it ordered the filing of tax evasion charges against local radio stations and newspapers which have been mostly critical of the ruling party.
These charges triggered the demise of the country's only two independent newspapers — The Phnom Pehn Post and The Cambodia Daily.
After receiving crippling tax bills, the Daily ceased its operations in September 2017, while the Post's owner sold the newspaper to a public relations company that has worked on behalf of the government.
Curiously, the video also stresses that “voter turnout (is) not a factor in determining (the) democratization process."
It even cites the low voting participation rate in countries such as the United States and France.
These elements may have been included in light of the fact that the CNRP is urging its supporters and the public to boycott the elections.
Speaking before the United Nations at the end of June 2018, the International Commission of Jurists summarized the criticism of human rights groups about the decline of democracy in Cambodia:
Authorities continue to abuse the legal system to repress civil society, independent media, the political opposition, and increasingly, ordinary individuals.
The Government has threatened prosecution of any person calling for a boycott of the highly compromised elections.
It has established a working group to monitor and control all information on websites and social media.
Ordinary people are being arrested, charged and detained under a new lèse-majesté law.
#NoToSocialMediaTax tweetathon poster by Innocent Amanyire / @NinnoJackJr
Join the Global Voices Sub-Saharan Africa team (@gvssafrica) for a multilingual tweetathon demanding an end to the taxation of social media in Uganda.
On July 1, the Ugandan government began enforcing a new law that imposes a 200 shilling daily levy on people using internet messaging platforms, despite protests from local and international online free speech advocates.
This move, according to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has the dual purpose of strengthening the national budget and also curtailing "gossip" by Ugandans on social media.
It was also popular among local telecom providers, who do not directly benefit from the use of foreign-based “over-the-top” services such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.
The policy was preceded with an order to register all new mobile SIM cards with the National Biometric Data Centre.
The measure also forces Ugandans to only use mobile money accounts in order to recharge their SIM cards and makes it mandatory to pay a one percent levy on the total value of transaction on any mobile money transaction.
These new policies make it more costly for Ugandans — especially those living in poverty — to communicate and perform everyday tasks using their mobile devices.
On July 2, civil society and legal advocates in Uganda filed a court challenge against the law, arguing that it violates the country's constitution.
A protester demonstrates his opposition to Uganda's social media tax at a gathering on July 6, 2018.
On July 6, concerned citizens and civil society advocates issued a joint press statement calling on Ugandans to avoid paying the tax by using alternate methods to exchange money and access social media, and to join a "National Day of Peaceful Protest Against Unfair Taxation" on Wednesday, July 11, 2018.
The Global Voices community and our network of friends and allies wish to support this and other efforts to demand an end to the tax.
We believe that this tax is simply a ploy to censor Ugandans and gag dissenting voices.
We believe social media should be freely accessible for all people, including Ugandans.
The Ugandan social media tax must go!
On Monday, July 9, beginning at 14:00 East Africa Time, we plan to tweet at community leaders, government and diplomatic actors, and media influencers to increase awareness and draw public attention to the issue.
We especially encourage fellow bloggers and social media users all over the world to join us.

JOINT PRESS STATEMENT ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE EXCISE DUTY ACT TO LEVY TAXES ON SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND MOBILE MONEY TRANSACTIONS
Convened on Friday, 6 July, 2018 at 2.00PM
On Tuesday, 3 July, 2018, we young people and youth leaders from various student guild governments, musicians and artistes, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and the Parliament of Uganda held a Press Conference at which we expressed our serious reservations and grave concerns about the amendment to the Excise Duty (Amendment) Act which levies a tax on social media access and an extortionist one per cent (1%) charge on Mobile Money transactions.
We implored the Speaker to recall Parliament from recess and asked the Leader of Government Business to table a motion to repeal the amendment by Friday, 6 July, 2018.
The deadline elapsed a few hours ago and we are here to announce the way forward:
i) We invite citizens and subscribers to stop transacting via any of the Mobile Money services and as an alternative, rely on physical payment methods so as to avoid paying the unfortunate tax;
ii) We further encourage citizens to use available options to stay online without paying the daily two hundred Uganda shillings (200/-) per day to access social media sites;
iii) We also call upon Members of Parliament to expedite the process of recalling the House but also to conduct consultations in their constituencies regarding this matter;
iiii) Finally, we are declaring Wednesday, 11 July, 2018 as a National Day of Peaceful Protest against Unfair Taxation.
In this regard, we invite citizens to deliver petitions to their Members of Parliament and to dress up in red coloured attire as they go about their daily business.
We have already notified the Uganda Police Force and a copy of the notification is available.
We will continue engaging our respective constituencies and leaders to protest, reject and continue the boycott until the poorly thought-out taxes are rescinded.
As young leaders, we have undertaken research and consultations and are willing to suggest better avenues and models of taxation that are sustainable and beneficial to both the citizen and the state.

Malagasy children by Yves Picq - CC-BY-SA-3.0
Since the Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed in 1991, Madagascar has been multiplying its efforts to implement policies that protect child rights and created more than 750 child protection networks within the country since 2004.
Despite this progress, abuse, violence, sexual exploitation and forced labor are still a tragic reality which silently occurs behind closed doors.
According to a report released by the Malagasy State and UNICEF, every second young Malagasy claims to have been the victim of violence at school, and nine kids out of ten have been beaten by their family.
An alarming report by UNICEF
Following a request by the Malagasy government, UNICEF carried out a study on violence perpetrated against children in the country.
The result of the study is beyond alarming:
89% of children report having suffered from physical domestic abuse at least once.
Nonetheless, 72% of them say they feel safe at home.
Globally, the report highlights that violence is very often rooted in traditional practices which are very difficult to challenge.
Rajae Sbihi, a child psychiatrist who partook to the study, explains:
Violence is considered as a means of education, whether it is at home or at school.

According to Sbihi, children in rural communities are even more at risk to violence, explaining that almost 20% of Malagasy children are not registered at birth – particularly in remote districts – which increases their vulnerability.
Public powers are indeed often one of the only safeguards for child victims of violence, even more, if it happens at home.
This type of violence leads to severe wounds, trauma, physical and emotional development troubles, risky behaviors or even dropping out of school altogether.
Different types of violence
Besides physical violence, there is a range of scenarios which hinders children development.
In fact, 40% of young Malagasy's report having worked before the age of 18.
Laureate Rasolofoniainarison, national administrator of projects at the office of the OIT (in English ILO: International Labour Organization) in Antananarivo, explains how this perpetuates the cycle of poverty:
Parents often say that they send them to work instead of going to school because they are poor.
In reality, making their children work is what makes them poor, by perpetuating a cycle in which education and the possibility of rising socially have no place.
Young girls are even more vulnerable to this violence.
Early marriage is part of the Malagasy tradition and is a problem for minors.
More than one-third of girls between the ages of 15 and 19-years-old are already married or in a relationship.
Very few teenagers use contraceptive methods (less than 8%) which considerably increases the number of unwanted pregnancies.
In fact, 30% of the minors in the island have a child, as reported by a rating from the World Atlas 2015.
This number reaches up to 50% in some areas of the capital.
Another alarming statistic is the rising rate of sexual exploitation of girls for commercial purposes, particularly near petroleum and mining sites.
A new tool to better fight violence
Before this report, children's needs and rights were unknown in Madagascar.
This latest report is seen as a tool which allows child protection advocates to better understand, prevent and respond to these risky situations.
It is also a first step towards a more comprehensive national policy which aims to reduce violence.
It can also be used as an argumentative tool to convince people to let go of traditional practices which can be detrimental to children.
In total, UNICEF has deployed 240 social volunteers on the island to provide psycho-social support, communal dialogue and social mobilisation.
UNICEF has also established partnerships in order to develop a code of conduct for all mining employees and sub-contractors in Madagascar, in an effort to end young women's sexual exploitation.
This practical approach should hopefully have a progressive impact on their protection in the next few years.
Ugandans protesting the rampant murders and kidnapping targeting women.

Since 2015, at least 42 Ugandan women have been kidnapped, maimed and murdered in and around Uganda's capital Kampala, half of them in a space of only three months in 2017.
Some of their bodies were found with brutal signs of sexual violence.
The string of murders, all bearing gruesome similar details, has horrified the country.
The motivation behind them remains unclear, but witchcraft is a popular theory. Authorities are yet to charge a single suspect.
Tired of living in fear, the women of Uganda felt they had to do something.
On June 30, 2018, the Women’s Protest Working Group (WPWG), with the support of feminists from other countries, staged a peaceful demonstration in the capital city of Kampala to protest against the rampant kidnapping and murders targeting women in Uganda.
And so I March.
To remember them, they were not given any justice and no one was held accountable for their gruesome deaths.
But I recognize them.
At the march, which Global Voices attended, WPWG leader Dr. Stella Nyanzi told the crowd that the women are pursuing key interventions such as justice for the families of those murdered and also to push for action on violence against women.
Fellow activist Patricia Twasiima then read out the names of the 42 murdered women.
Earlier, the police had attempted to block the protests claiming that the issues the women were protesting had already been resolved after President Museveni addressed the nation on his 10-point plan for restoring security in Uganda.
A letter from the Commissioner of Police stated:
This serves to inform you that the intended demonstration to raise awareness, express displeasure about the spate of killings and kidnap of women/girls cannot be allowed to go on as scheduled.
The women were determined to go on with the protest anyway:
We will no longer settle for speeches, thought and prayers, from the police force and government funded with taxpayers’ money.
The attempted ban triggered even more support from Ugandans including journalists who vowed to join, with men and women alike.
Writer Daniel Kalinaki wrote an opinion piece in the Daily Monitor that made rounds on Twitter on why he would be joining the protest:
So I will be at the march. With my daughter.
We will hold hands and walk, unarmed and peacefully, along with others.
I want her to love her country and learn, as a young African woman, to stand up and speak up.
When she grows up she, and others like her, will be the saviours of the broken, the beaten, and the damned.
Welcome to the Black Parade – and I hope the police are smart enough not to stain it blood-red.
TV journalist Mujuni Raymond said that he would also join the protest:
I have been to the murder crime scenes of atleast 13 women, I have seen the gruesome nature their lives have been ended.
It's inhuman to only offer hope and prayers.
Action must be taken.
Eventually, police gave in to the pressure.
The women’s march observed strict guidelines set by the police.
This is the first peaceful protest led by activists since the passing of the controversial Public Order Management Act 2013, which grants the Police's Inspector General wide discretion to permit or forbid public gatherings.
Past protests since the Act was published have turned violent.
The March wields more pressure on authorities not only to provide a safer society for women but also to uphold Uganda’s constitution and respect citizens' right to freedom of assembly.
Ugandans are standing up against a new tax on social media and Mobile Money.
On July 1, 2018, the Ugandan government started taxing citizens a fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings (USD $0.05) for using social media, raising substantial condemnation from Ugandans.
With Uganda's average GDP per capita at USD $604.00, daily use of social media or messaging apps could eat up three percent of the average Ugandan's annual earnings.
The fight to resist the social media tax took a legal twist on July 2 when concerned citizens approached the courts, claiming that the tax violates Uganda's constitution.
Petitioners argued that the tax contravenes the human rights of Ugandans as enshrined in "the specified provisions of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda".
Kenyan newspaper The Daily Nation reports:
The petition, filed by a team of young advocates under their Cyber Law Initiative (U) Limited and four individuals, Mr Opio Bill Daniel, Mr Baguma Moses, Mr Okiror Emmanuel and Mr Silver Kayondo against the attorney-general, is challenging the Constitutionality of the (200 USH) daily charge for access to social media platforms.
The petition is particularly targeting several sections of the Excise Duty Amendment Act 2018, which provided for taxes on Over The Top (OTT) services from mobile telephone usage.
The petitioners also implored the court to issue an order that will permanently halt payment on the social media tax.
PCTech magazine reports:
They want the court to issue an order, permanently stopping the government and all her agencies, authorities and officials from imposing any tax on internet or social media usage.
In addition, they also want an order, directing the government and government regulatory body of the communications sector; Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) to only regulate OTT services in a manner that guarantees free access, net neutrality, and open internet.
Ugandan lawyer Silver Kayondo vowed to "fight up to the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights":
#SocialMediaTax Petitioners have been joined by Raymond Mujuni in defence of OTT journalistic sources and #digital broadcasting.
On our way to Court to file against the AG. UCC and URA added for consequential Orders. We'll fight up to the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights — Silver Kayondo (@SilverKayondo) July 2, 2018
The Global Voices community, which we represent, has also taken a stand on the issue and organized a tweetathon in solidarity with activists in Uganda, set to take place on Monday, July 9.

As the legal battle ensues, questions around equity, justice, and access remain and need further investigation.
According to a survey by the National Information Technology Authority, 77 percent of Ugandans cannot afford basic internet usage costs and only 22 percent of the total population currently uses the internet.
Rather than investing in infrastructure that could expand Ugandans' access to broadband connectivity, the government has imposed a social media tax seriously limits access while bringing more money to its own coffers.
Critics see the tax as a form of double taxation because airtime and data were already taxed.
Now, many users say they simply can not afford to pay the extra 200 USH per user per day to access web-based social and communication platforms, also known as over-the-top (OTT) services.
The tax widens the internet access gap not just for Ugandan youth and the poor, but also for women, furthering the gender digital divide.

Ugandan youth on social media frontlines feel the social media tax squeeze
Uganda struggles with one of the highest unemployment rates in East Africa.
A 2014 Ugandan census report indicated that out of over 18 million people between the ages of 14 and 64, 58 percent were unemployed.
At the same time, 52 percent of Ugandans owned mobile phones and 71 percent of these users live in rural areas, according to a 2014 report by the Uganda Communications Commission.
Youth ages 15 to 24 years old are on the frontlines of smartphone usage and make up 28 percent of the population.
Many rely on their phones and on WhatsApp to engage in businesses that run on mobile money.
They say they feel that the social media tax will only stifle entrepreneurship, ease of business, and creativity.
The Collaboration on International ICT Policy in East and Southern Africa (CIPESA) points out that just one gigabyte (GB) of data will now cost users nearly 40 percent of their average monthly income:
Part 1: The cost to connect for #Uganda’s poorest will jump by 10%, resulting in just 1GB of data costing them nearly 40% of their average monthly income.

An affront to already over-burdened citizens
The social media tax comes on the heels of the controversial social media "gossip tax" in April 2018 and is seen as an affront to already over-burdened citizens.
At that time, President Museveni wrote:
I am not going to propose a tax on internet use for educational, research or reference purposes... these must remain free.
However, olugambo (gossip) on social media (opinions, prejudices, insults, friendly chats) and advertisements by Google and I do not know who else must pay tax because we need resources to cope with the consequences of their lugambo.
The government's categorization of social media platforms as a luxury activity exposed a deep lack of digital literacy among policymakers in the Museveni government.
Ugandan journalist Daniel K. Kalinaki succinctly summarized the impact of both the "gossip tax" and the "social media tax" on everyday Ugandan citizens:
There are basically two problems with the social media tax.
First, it shoots the wrong person twice: A Facebook user has already paid tax on the mobile phone, data and electricity; they are, except in a few cases, the product, not the revenue.
The tax is like taking money at the gate then also charging for the seats in an empty stadium.
Secondly, people generally don’t gossip or insult others for a living; they do so because they are idle, sad and often unemployed.
Imposing a tax to keep them quiet is the cyber equivalent of asking starving people who don’t have millet to eat red velvet chocolate cake instead.
This and the mobile money tax have taken many young and poor people, including many in the countryside who have never paid a direct tax, through the organ grinder of our tax system.
You can hear the screams from Kidera to Kyotera.
Riot police closing in on protesters on May 5, 2018, in Moscow // DonSimon, CC0
Anti-corruption activists who protested against Vladimir Putin’s fourth inauguration as president have seen their tweets, and in some cases their retweets of others' publications, used by authorities as evidence of inciting mass disturbances.
On May 5, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), Russia’s leading opposition organization, held a series of rallies across Russia under the common slogan “He’s not a tzar to us."
The demonstrations were met with violent resistance from both the police and loyalist groups.
In Moscow, the rally on Pushkinskaya square was attacked by men in Cossack uniforms (whom the government often uses as paramilitary squads to harass the opposition while avoiding blame for direct police involvement,) as well as by regular and riot police.
Dozens of people were injured, including at least 25 reporters, and more than 1,600 were detained.
Several dozen participants were put to trial for "taking part in an unsanctioned protest" or "resisting police."
Alexey Navalny, FBK’s leader who was arrested at the Moscow rally, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for “repeated violations of public order.”
More arrests came after May 5.
Over the next weeks, 28 FBK organizers and activists in total were taken into custody, charged with inciting riots based on their tweets or retweets, according to the organization's lawyer Ivan Zhdanov — who himself was arrested on May 24.
While some were only fined and released, others were sentenced to the longest possible term for a misdemeanor under Russian law, 30 days.
Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s longtime campaign manager, said:
Ivan Zhdanov has just been detained outside our office.
He’s facing the same article 20.2 (but it’s his first time, so he’ll only get 10 days, not 30), so there goes another “organizing a rally by retweet.” Looks like this time they’re just locking up everyone.
Elena Malakhovskaya, a news presenter on Navalny LIVE, FBK's YouTube channel, was arrested near her home for covering the May 5 protests on the channel — or "organizing an unsanctioned rally," according to the police.
News presenter @elmalakhovskaya has been detained near her home.
In most other cases, the incriminating evidence against FBK activists were their tweets or retweets.
For example, Kira Yarmysh, Navalny’s press officer, was sentenced to 25 days based on the following message:
We did not vote for those in power.
To go out and protest on the 5th of May means to say to yourself and those around you: I don’t agree with what’s happening.
Since we have been deprived of our right to choose, the only way to make our voices heard is this: https://t.co/2k3nFrTs1S
Yarmysh’s tweet links to a YouTube video on Navalny’s channel promoting the May 5 rally.
The video has accumulated over 3 million views at the time of writing.
Another Navalny LIVE host, Ruslan Shavetdinov, was also jailed for 30 days based on his retweet of a similar message — although he was merely one of many thousands to do so.
Human rights groups are saying this is part of a larger trend where more and more Russians are jailed for their online activity.
Agora, a pro-bono law firm that offers legal assistance to defendants in such cases, says the number of prosecutions for posts and even reposts on social media in Russia is growing exponentially.
According to their latest report, in 2017 a Russian internet user was sent to jail every eight days.

Three Russian journalists were killed on the night of July 30 in Central African Republic, at a checkpoint outside the country’s capital Bangui.
Veteran reporter Orkhan Dzhemal, award-winning filmmaker Aleksandr Rastorguev and cameraman Kirill Radchenko were shot and killed by unidentified assailants who emerged from the bushes at roadside when they arrived.
The attack took place amid an on-going conflict between the country’s government and various rebel groups.
Their deaths were confirmed by the Investigations Control Center (TsUR, Tsentr Upravleniya Rassledovaniyami), an investigative reporting outlet funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil magnate currently living in exile in London.
According The Moscow Times, Russia has supplied arms and deployed training teams to aid CAR government security forces.
According to TsUR, on whose assignment Dzhemal, Rastorguev and Radchenko went to CAR, the journalists were pursuing a news tip about a group of armed Russian mercenaries sighted in the African country.
This armed group's existence has never been officially acknowledged, although numerous journalistic investigations pinpointed the so-called ‘Wagner Group’ in hotspots such as Syria and Eastern Ukraine.
Although he is consistently denying the allegations, the ‘Wagner Group’ is widely believed to be funded by Evgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman with strong ties to Vladimir Putin, sanctioned by the U.S. for his alleged — and, again, never acknowledged — involvement in the 2016 presidential elections.
Dzhemal, Rastorguev and Radchenko were highly respected media professionals, recognized by the industry.
Orkhan Dzhemal was a renowned war reporter, his career stretching back to the early years of Russia’s independent press.
Alexander Rastorguev was praised for his vivid chronicle of Russia’s failed anti-Putin opposition surge in his 2013 documentary “The Term” (Srok.)
Kirill Radchenko worked as a TV reporter in war zones such as Syria.

“Mexico is living through the most violent electoral process of recent years and the statistics are alarming".
Image used with permission.
This is the third installment in our series on Mexico’s upcoming elections on 1 July 2018.
In the first post we looked at the background of Mexican democracy after 70 years of a hegemonic party in power.
In the second piece we looked briefly at each of the four aspiring presidential candidates.
In this latest post, we turn our attention to the opinion polls and the general state of the country.
What do the polls say?
Following the three debates officially organized by the electoral authorities, there are approximately two weeks left until Mexicans go to the ballot box.
The pollsters (Consulta Mitofsky, B&L, GCE to mention a few) and analyses of polling averages (Oraculus) all identify a clear leader.
All consistently report Andrés M. López in the lead, approaching 50% of voting count, followed – although not closely – by Ricardo Anaya.
As we discussed in the last part of this series, Andrés M. López was put forward by the political party he founded (Movimiento Regeneración Nacional – MORENA) after having made two previous unsuccessful bids.
As noted in the first piece, Mexico has been suffering the consequences of an armed conflict since 2006 when then-president Felipe Calderón declared 'war' on organized crime.
Since then the violence has only intensified.
In this context, 112 political candidates have been killed in the run-up to these elections, as this graphic by Pictoline illustrates:
Tweet image: 112 politicians have been murdered in Mexico since the electoral period began; 42 were candidates or pre-candidates for a popularly elected post; the largest number of murders took place in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, and the State of Mexico Tweet text: Mexico is living through the most violent electoral process of recent years.
And the numbers are alarming.
"We can be sure that the criminals will win"
According to activist Orlando Camacho:
The violence is terrible, it is a reflection of institutional weakness; these elections are an accurate snapshot of the country’s reality in terms of violence.
Professor Jesús Silva-Herzog wrote:
A few weeks ago Eduardo Guerrero announced the sure winner of the 2018 elections in his article for El Financiero.
He did not make projections with the data taken by the polls.
He did not refer to the presidential election.
He was speaking of the criminal organizations that, without formally appearing on the ballots, are deciding the election.
We can be sure that the criminals will win, the security expert said.
They will win because they are eliminating their enemies and because they have dominated those who will occupy positions in the town halls which are vital for their interests.
He concluded:
Today in Mexico one does not attain power with weapons, but controls access to power with weapons
This climate of generalized violence has not been unnoticed by several international media outlets, such as El País which reported that two candidates in Oaxaca and Puebla (in southern Mexico) were killed in a 24 hour period.
Trade negotiation or trade war?
While this is happening, Mexico is in the middle of renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; TLCAN in Spanish) with its main trade partners and regional neighbours: the US and Canada.
The renegotiation is taking place following the presidential campaign promises of Donald Trump who assured his supporters that he would make new changes to further benefit his country.
President Trump claimed that Mexico benefits disproportionately from NAFTA and has made a series of insulting remarks about migrants.
The most recent example was calling some of the people arriving in USA from the Mexican border “animals”.
However, returning to the matter of economics, Mexico’s trade situation has become difficult due to USA’s imposition of tariffs on imported products, ordered by Trump, which provoked retaliatory measures by Mexico.
Some media outlets in Mexico, among them SinEmbargo, have described the situation as a “trade war”.
Stay tuned for the next episode in the series, when we look at the Mexican presidential elections from the perspective of press freedom and discuss the heated exchanges which have taken place on social media.
"No More Silence."

In most countries around the world, gender-based harassment is an old problem.
But in the digital era, with hashtag movements such as #MeToo, and social media platforms where evidence of harassment can go viral, the balance of power between harassers and their targets appears to be shifting.
A recent example comes from Pakistan, where video showing a man following and harassing a group of women went viral on Facebook and Twitter, leading to public condemnation and ultimately to his arrest.
In 2016 in the Kalash Valley, in the Chitral region of northern Pakistan, Aimal Khan began following a group of women and filming them with his phone.
He made derogatory comments towards them, and continually asked them to pose for pictures with him, despite their refusal and their threats to report him to police.
Khan even claimed that he himself was a police officer.
Online, people expressed support for the arrest.
Aimal Khan was released on bail soon after as he was charged under a bailable Section of the Law.
In the First Information Report Aimal Khan has been charged under Sections 354 (assaulting a female), 419 (cheating by personation), 294 (engage in obscene act in public places) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code instead of Pakistan Electronic Cyber Act.
His trial is to be held soon.
Activists are concerned about the laws used in the First Information Report.
Although Pakistan's Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act covers harassment of this nature, and could have been brought to bear in Khan's case, the law was not passed until August 2016, after the incident in Chitral had already occurred.
Nighat Dad, a law and technology expert who runs the non-profit Digital Rights Foundation and contributes to Global Voices, explained to Global Voices that the Pakistan Penal Code in itself does not have any provisions for video-linked incidents related to harassment.
Dad also spoke about social media playing a major role in Aimal Khan’s arrest, pointing to the impact of public outcry around the matter and its likely effect on the police response.
She noted that the immediate arrest sent "a good message for the masses" but that it would be up to law enforcement and judicial institutions to carry the issue forward and ensure that justice is served.
Such incidents are not new.
In July 2017, Meenah Tariq of Lahore went to Hunza Valley in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan for sightseeing.
She was harassed by some young men along the way.
Since she did not know of a means to lodge a complaint against them, she took their pictures and launched a social media campaign that soon went viral.
In Tariq's case, it appears that state institutions responded in a meaningful way.
When Hunza Assistant Commissioner Anas Goraya learned of her experience, he set up a help line in Hunza to deal with such cases.
How many times have you been told it is useless to complain?
It is useless to speak up, nothing will ever change?
Here is proof that this isn’t always the case.
Here is proof that we do need to keep speaking up about issues we face, having these conversations, sparking dialogue even when it’s difficult.
Aimal Khan's arrest following public outcry on social media is a good sign.
But in this case, the question remains: will justice prevail?
More Than Me's founder, Katie Meyler, in Liberia, September 19, 2016, Wikimedia Commons, sourced from More Than Me's official Flickr page.
Last week, the US investigative journalism project ProPublica broke a story titled Unprotected about a massive sex abuse scandal at More Than Me (MTM), a non-governmental organization that primarily operates schools to support Liberia’s most vulnerable girls in West Point, Monrovia.
The exposé left many wondering how such gross negligence was possible, but private schools run by NGOs like MTM are cropping up all over Africa, one altruistic idealist at a time.
Founded in 2008 by Katie Meyler, an American, and Macintosh Johnson, a Liberian, Meyler’s evangelical-style faith in the MTM mission led her to raise $8 million from international donors, celebrities and philanthropists.
Since its inception, MTM has scaled up from one to 19 different schools serving over 4,000 students.
Meyler and Johnson lacked experience in education or development, but in Liberia, where 60 percent of school-age children are out of school, Meyler cast herself as a savior of sorts who could pick up where Liberia’s decimated education system left off.
In 2013, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf deemed the education system “a mess” after all 25,000 enrolled high school students failed state exams.
Recovering from civil war and a devasting Ebola crisis, the Liberian government was desperate for solutions and turned to international donors and do-gooders for support.
On MTM academy’s opening day, President Sirleaf publicly endorsed Meyler, stating that what she wanted more than anything for her country was “to expand Katie Meyler’s initiative to as many communities as possible.”
With few legal restrictions, requirements or obstacles, Meyler established MTM as a reputable organization by spinning a mesmerizing tale of salvation all over social media.
Culpability without consequence
By the end of 2012, however, rumors of allegations of sexual abuse against Johnson had already begun to circulate within the MTM community.
But by that time, Meyler was soaring through the world of elite philanthropists as a “charity star,” winning a major $1 million award from JPMorgan Chase and recognition as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year in 2014 for her work with Ebola response.
According to ProPublica, Meyler had suspicions of Johnson’s proclivity toward young girls as early as 2011, but the pair were in an on-and-off intimate relationship, and she failed to take quick, decisive action against him.
Others who suspected Johnson hesitated to come forward because they worried Meyler would choose her boyfriend over the girls, explained MTM school nurse Iris Martor.
The ProPublica investigation confirms that Johnson raped and abused nearly a third of the schoolgirls, some as young as 10 years old.
MTM staff finally reported Johnson to the police in 2014, and he was taken into custody with a subsequent criminal investigation and several juried court hearings.
Meyler continued to communicate with Johnson while he was in custody, but did not attend his hearings.
Johnson ended up dying of AIDS before his trial resolved.
ProPublica confirms that several of the girls whom Johnson raped also contracted HIV.
MTM denied any wrong-doing except hiring Johnson in the first place.
MTM board members claim that MTM created a “safe environment” with full commitments to child rights and child protection.
Meyler spun herself in the story as yet another victim duped by Johnson and commended the girls who came forward, vowing to fight even harder for their protection.
MTM provided scholarships and housing for some of Johnson’s victims, but others transferred out and at least one returned to a harsh life on the streets.
White saviors, fragile states
Today, MTM continues to operate in direct partnership with the Liberian government.
In 2016, the Ministry of Education launched Partnership Schools for Liberia under the Liberia Education Advancement Program, outsourcing nearly 100 schools to for-profit and non-profit NGO’s including MTM, Bridge International Academies (also under investigation for misleading practices), and Rising Academies, among others.
Teachers unions in Liberia and abroad, as well as development professionals who oppose school privatization in Africa, vocally condemned this initiative.
Yet, despite mixed results in its first year, the government plans to double the number of outsourced schools by 2019, following a growing trend across the African continent.
One study estimates that one in four children in Africa—66 million children—will attend privatized schools by 2021.
Of Liberia's seven inaugural partnerships, over half were founded by white non-Africans, driven by missions fueled by philanthropic altruism rather than contextualized knowledge.
Race, gender and privilege played a major role in the formation of MTM and organizations like it.
As a white American woman, Meyler received a lot of passes that a black Liberian probably wouldn’t, former MTM board member Chidegar “Chid” Liberty told ProPublica.
“There was an ignorance of how badly things could go if the right structures of governance weren’t in place,” says Liberty, a Liberian-American based part-time in Monrovia.
Meyler’s willful ignorance goes hand in hand with the ‘white savior complex,’ a term referring to white people driven to help non-white people and rooted in a history of colonialism and racism that perpetuates degrading stereotypes of “uncivilized” black Africa.
Liberty, who left the board in 2015, went on record with ProPublica to say he believes that the organization “actually played a significant role in a big institutional crime against these girls.”
“Anywhere else in the world, everybody involved would be in some way held to account,” Liberty said, suggesting that Meyler and the organization’s white privilege informed every aspect of MTM’s ethos and actions.
Scale up or scale back
Liberia’s plans to scale up private-public school partnerships are unprecedented on the continent.
From Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg, philanthropists belonging to what ProPublica calls a “rarefied world of globe-trotting problem-solvers” circle failing governments with predatory focus.
This group recognizes the expediency of investing in African education, and how easily it can be disguised as altruism.
Proponents of school privatization insist that private schools simply perform better than struggling state schools.
But as the MTM debacle shows, their feverish insistence on rapid scale-up—which offers a quick return on their emotional and financial investments—can lead to human rights violations of epic proportions.
If nations like Liberia fail to see education as a universal human right granted by the state, their struggle to overhaul their education system will continue to depend on organizations like MTM to fill the void.
In an October 14 letter posted on the MTM website, Meyler announced that she will be temporarily stepping down from her role as CEO while the organization conducts its own investigation of the allegations presented in ProPublica's expose.
Undisputably, horrific crimes were committed on MTM’s school grounds with zero accountability.
Meyler subjected Monrovia’s most vulnerable girls to an evangelical fantasy of “salvation” that spun terrifyingly out of control and put them in harm’s way, using all the tropes of “do-gooder” development.
But anyone who spends time in Africa knows someone like Meyler, and maybe even recognizes her idealism in their own projects.
Despite vocal criticism, the 173 billion dollar voluntourism industry is on the rise on the continent, offering young idealists the freedom to live out their savior fantasies at the expense of vulnerable communities.
From Instagram to TED talks, there’s a global choir ready for the next sermon.
A potent mix of privilege and incompetence often leads to major mistakes.
I've made a few of my own and I know friends, colleagues, and former students have also fumbled through the complexities of development projects for which they lacked experience or knowledge.
Real development takes time—there are no quick fixes.
Not every project derails as badly as MTM did, and not every white person working in Africa is reckless.
Competence, of course, cuts across race, class, and gender.
But Meyler's story signals an urgent wake-up call for structure, solidarity, accountability and integrity when it comes to development—if we're meant to keep working this way at all.
Why are African governments criminalising online speech?

Africa’s landscape of online free speech and dissent is gradually, but consistently, being tightened.
In legal and economic terms, the cost of speaking out is rapidly rising across the continent.
While most governments are considered democratic in that they hold elections with multi-party candidates and profess participatory ideals, in practice, many operate much closer dictatorships — and they appear to be asserting more control over digital space with each passing day.
Cameroon, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Benin have in the recent past witnessed internet shutdowns, the imposition of taxes on blogging and social media use, and the arrest of journalists.
Media workers and citizens have been jailed on charges ranging from publishing “false information” to exposing state secrets to terrorism.
At the recent Forum of Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFA) held in Accra, Ghana, a group of panelists from various African countries all said they feared African governments were interested in controlling digital space to keep citizens in check.
Many countries have statutes and laws which guarantee the right to free expression.
In Nigeria, for example, the Freedom of Information Act grants citizens the right to demand information from any government agency.
Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution provides for freedom of the press and Section 39 maintains that “every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference…”
Yet, Nigeria has issued other laws that authorities use to deny these aforementioned rights.
Section 24 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act criminalises “anyone who spreads messages he knows to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent.”
Making laws with ambiguous and subjective terms like "inconvenience" or "insult" calls for concern.
Governments and their agents often use this as a cover to suppress freedom of expression.
Who determines the definition of an insult?
Should public officials expect to develop a thick skin?
In many parts of the world, citizens have the right to criticise public officials.
Why don't Africans have the right to offend as an essential part of free expression?
In 2017 and 2016, Nigerian online journalists and bloggers Abubakar Sidiq Usman and Kemi Olunloyo were each booked on spurious charges of cyber-stalking in connection with journalistic investigations on the basis of the Cybercrime Act.
The very existence of these legal challenges tells citizens that their voices matter.
From Tanzania’s prohibition on spreading “false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate” information online to Uganda’s tax on social media that is intended to curb “gossip”, the noise made on digital platforms scares oppressive regimes. In some cases, it may even lead them to rescind their actions.
The experience of the Zone9 bloggers of Ethiopia provides a powerful example.
In 2014, nine Ethiopian writers were jailed and tortured over a collective blogging project in which they wrote about human rights violations by Ethiopia’s former government, daring to speak truth to power.
The state labeled the group “terrorists” for their online activity and incarcerated them for almost 18 months.
Zone9 members Mahlet (left) and Zelalem (right) rejoiced at the release of Befeqadu Hailu (second from left, in scarf) in October 2015.

Six members of the now liberated group made their premier international engagement in Ghana during FIFA conference: Atnaf Berhane, Befeqadu Hailu Techane, Zelalem Kibret, Natnael Feleke Aberra, and Abel Wabella were all in attendance.
Jomanex Kasaye, who had worked with the group prior to the arrests (but was not arrested) also attended.
Several members had collaborated with Global Voices to write and translate stories into the Amharic. As members of the community, Global Voices campaigned and mobilised the global human rights community to speak out about their case from the very first night they were arrested.
After months of writing stories and promoting their case on Twitter, international condemnation of their arrest and imprisonment began to flow from governments and prominent human rights leaders, alongside hundreds of thousands of online supporters.
From the four-compass points of the world, a mighty cry arose demanding the Ethiopian government to free the Zone9 bloggers.
In their remarks at FIFA, the bloggers said that their membership in the Global Voices community was key to visibility during their time in prison.
In their panel session, they credited Global Voices' campaign for keeping them alive.
Berhan Taye, the panel moderator, asked the group to recount their prison experiences.
As they spoke, the lights on the stage dimmed.
Their voices filled the room with a quiet power.
Abel Wabella, who ran Global Voices' Amharic site, lost hearing in one ear due to the torture he endured after refusing to sign a false confession.
Atnaf Berhane recalled that one of his torture sessions lasted until 2 a.m. and then continued after he had a few hours of sleep.
One of the security agents who arrested Zelalem Kibret had once been Kibret's student at the university where he taught.
Jomanex Kasaye recounted the mental agony of leaving Ethiopia before his friends were arrested — the anguish of powerlessness — the unending suspense and fear that his friends would not make it out alive.
