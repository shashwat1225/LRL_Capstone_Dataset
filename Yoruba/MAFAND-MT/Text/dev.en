--- FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI’S 2020 EASTER MESSAGE TO NIGERIANS
I rejoice with our Christian brothers and sisters as well as all Nigerians on the occasion of the celebration of this year’s Easter.
This year’s commemoration of Easter comes amid the grip with which COVID-19 has held the entire world.
Unprecedented in living memory, majority of Christians have found themselves marking Easter in a subdued manner, away from the usual congregation in churches.
This is unusual and very unfortunate.
However, I wish to enjoin our Christian compatriots to rekindle their faith in Christ who overcame persecution, sufferings and displayed endurance, steadfastness and above all piety.
Jesus Christ represented man’s ability to withstand temporary pains in the hope of everlasting glory.
I urge you to imbibe and live the values of humility, discipline, perseverance, sacrifice and obedience which Jesus Christ demonstrated during His stay on earth.
There is no better opportunity than now for all Christians in particular, and Nigerians in general, to remain faithful and hopeful that with intensified prayers backed by personal and collective responsibility, the nation shall pull through this most difficult trial.
I have no doubt that if all stakeholders – individuals and groups – play their part to the fullest as advised by our scientists and medical experts in confronting COVID-19, the inherent resilience and determination of our people will enable us to pull through.
As I stated in my national broadcast on Sunday, March 29, 2020, since there is currently no known vaccine against the virus, “the best and most efficient way to avoid getting infected is through regular hygiene and sanitary practices as well as social distancing.”
May I use this opportunity to commend the encouraging containment and ameliorating strategies put in place by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.
I am very much aware of the personal and collective inconveniences suffered by our people due to measures such as restriction of movements and closure of business premises.
Being “a matter of life and death,” these sacrifices are in everybody’s interest to save our country from calamity.
The welfare of our people is paramount.
Accordingly, the most economically vulnerable in our communities will continue to be uppermost in our plans, and efforts will be made to supply them with basic means of survival.
While we see the COVID-19 pandemic as a global challenge, this administration is not oblivious of the constant threat posed to our national security by terrorists and insurgents.
They may take this opportunity to perpetrate attacks.
But our armed forces and other security and intelligence services will remain vigilant and continue to contain these threats and consolidate efforts to eradicate them completely.
As we mark this year’s Easter, whatever the circumstances, I encourage you to make the most of the situation and to keep safe.
I wish you all a Happy Easter.
Muhammadu Buhari, President, Federal Republic of Nigeria

--- COVID-19: See as the federal capital territory was so quite
If it was a priest or an herbalist that gave a warning to all Nigerians that a disease is coming that will cause everybody to sit at home.
That a disease is coming that will cause business men to lock up their shops, that a disease is upcoming that will cause all that travel abroad because of headache or a brief illness refuse to go as usual, that they will sit at home, I’m so sure that all Nigerians will say the priest or the herbalist oracle does not a speak good thing.
But, God does as he pleases him, COVID-19 disease called corona virus enter Nigeria, all of us kept quit, this virus that respect not the rich, poor, even the virus does not regard its source, China.
One thing that is certain is that under any circumstances, Nigeria will succeed, Nigeria will be free from corona virus.
Its compulsory that she be free from corona virus.
When corona will leave Nigeria, all Nigerians should learn one or two lessons from it that there is no one too big for God to arrest or capture.
We all in Nigeria should learn a lesson that there is no place like home.
If we have equipped all our hospitals be it federal government hospitals or the state government hospitals, all the health care center either small or the university teaching hospitals in Nigeria are standard, equivalent to all other hospitals abroad where the rich men go when they have a brief illness, if all our hospitals are standard, the problem and trouble of corona virus will be minimal in Nigeria.
My advise is that we should all come together in cooperation to bridge all the gaps in Nigeria either on our hospitals or our economy that our nation may grow.
A word is enough to the wise, thanks so much.

---First Ebola case recorded in DRC city of Goma
The first case of Ebola in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city, Goma, was discovered on Sunday, officials said, raising concerns the virus could spread quicker in a densely populated area close to the Rwandan border.
Goma, a lakeside city of 1 million people, is more than 350 km south of where the second-largest Ebola outbreak on record was first detected a year ago.
But the haemorrhagic fever has gradually spread south, infecting nearly 2,500 people and killing more than 1,600.
How Ebola spread to Goma
The patient was a priest who became infected during a visit to the town of Butembo, 200 km north of Goma, where he interacted with Ebola patients, Congo’s health ministry said in a statement.
He developed symptoms last week before taking a bus to Goma on Friday. When he arrived in Goma on Sunday he went to a clinic where he tested positive for Ebola.
“Due to the speed with which the patient has been identified and isolated, as well as the identification of all bus passengers from Butembo, the risk of spreading to the rest of the city of Goma remains low,” the ministry said.
Goma has been preparing for the arrival of Ebola for a year, setting up hand-washing stations and making sure motorcycle riders do not share helmets.
But in more rural areas, the virus has been hard to contain. Local mistrust of health officials and militia violence have hobbled containment efforts, and caused the number of new cases to spike.
Ebola causes diarrhea, vomiting and haemorrhagic fever and can be spread through bodily fluids.
An epidemic between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa.
WHO responds
The first case of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern city of Goma is a potential game-changer in the scale of the outbreak, World Health Organization Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Tedros said he was hopeful that there would be no further spread of the disease in the city, but he was convening the WHO’s emergency committee to decide if the outbreak now constituted an international health emergency.

An Ebola Treatment Centre in Goma, DRC, has been operational since February, and the person is now receiving care there. As part of the preparedness, 3000 #healthworkers have been vaccinated in this city alone.
