[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene.
The SNTP also reported the incident:
URGENT At this time, 3:30 am, a commission from the Intelligence Forces arrives to journalist and human rights activist Luis Carlos Díaz's home, missing since 5:30 pm #WhereIsLuisCarlos
Other human rights and freedom of speech organizations joined the campaign through #DondeEstaLuisCarlos (Where is Luis Carlos?) which is, at the moment, a trending topic in Venezuela's twittosphere.
Díaz is a journalist and a human rights and freedom of speech advocate who is well known and highly appreciated in Venezuela and abroad for his commentary and criticism of the government of Nicolas Maduro.
He has long worked with Soto producing web-based video and radio programs focused on politics and human rights in Venezuela.
He has also worked as an educator and promoter of the creation of citizen media spaces and independent media projects.
Díaz has also been part of the Global Voices community for more than a decade.
To me, Luis Carlos is a brilliant person, well versed in information and networks in this chaotic Venezuela of ours.
He has been able to make links with society (from criticism to cultural spaces) #WhereIsLuisCarlos.
Just a few days prior to his disappearance, the state-affiliated media program Con el Mazo Dando showed a video clip of a recent broadcast of Diaz.
The program's host, politician Diosdado Cabello, insinuated that Diaz had helped to orchestrate the nationwide power outage that had Venezuelans living in the dark for more than 24 hours on March 7 and 8.
There is no evidence to support this.
It's been been seven hours since Luis Carlos Díaz has gone missing.
[Díaz] is a journalist for Unión Radio Noticias and he's a human rights activist.
We're at the SEBIN headquarters and they deny having him [in custody there] #WhereIsLuisCarlos
[Update: they later confirmed Diaz was in custody]
Journalist Vladimir Villegas denounced that he had been detained by government forces:
We've been informed that @Unionradionet journalist Luis Carlos Díaz, has been detained by State's security forces.
We express our concern for his physical integrity.
We demand any information of his whereabouts and respect for his human rights.
The Global Voices community stands in solidarity with Luis Carlos, his family, and all other independent journalists working to hold power to account in Venezuela.
We wish for his safe and speedy return, and will continue to update this story as it develops.
Nigeria's social media bill will obliterate online freedom of expression
The draconian bill will legalize internet shutdowns in Nigeria
Senator Mohammed Sani Musa is the sponsor of the social media bill. Screenshot from Channel Television You Tube video.
On November 20, the Protection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulation of other Related Matters Bill 2019, known as the "social media bill", sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, sailed through a second reading.
The social media bill aims to curb online falsehoods and mis- and disinformation.
However, the real intent is not regulation, but rather, the annihilation of online freedom of expression, criminalization of government criticism and legalization of internet shutdowns in Nigeria.
A similar bill was beaten dead in its track in 2016.
Any form of government criticism is a crime
This bill aims to "[prevent] the transmission of false statements or declaration of facts in Nigeria", according to Section 1a.
It will ban the dissemination statements likely to be "prejudicial" to Nigeria, including subjects like public health, public safety, "public tranquility or public finances" and Nigeria's "friendly relations with other countries".
The bill will also "detect, control and safeguard against coordinated misuse of online accounts and bots", according to Section 1c.
In other words, everything is permissible to monitor and control in the proposed law — under the guise of fighting false information.
The social media bill is omniscient since it will be binding for every Nigerian citizen, regardless of residence or geographic location, as long as the ambiguous "false statement of fact" is transmitted within the country.
Section 3a to b(i) of the social media bill states that:
A person must not do any act in or outside Nigeria in order to transmit in Nigeria a statement knowing or having reasons to believe that it is a false statements of fact; and the transmission of the statement in Nigeria is likely to be, prejudicial to the security of Nigeria or any part of Nigeria.
The nebulous "national security" excuse is used to justify the trumping of free expression.
But it does not stop there, the Nigerian government is always right and cannot be criticized.
According to Section 3b(vi), any statement that diminishes “public confidence in the performance of any duty or function of, in the exercise of any power of the government” is prohibited.
According to Section 3b(v), this applies to any statement that: "incites feelings of enmity, hatred, directed at persons or ill-will between different groups of persons".
This is dangerous because it leaves regulators open to contradictory interpretations that could be abused by political actors.
Who defines and approves what incites feelings of hatred?
It means that seeking transparency or even daring to hold a politician accountable could be declared hateful.
The punishment upon conviction for any provisions of the bill is a fine that ranges between 200,000 and 10 million naira [about $556 to $28,000 United States dollars], imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.
Police licensed to shut down the internet
The social media bill also grants the government unlimited power to switch off the internet, through the "Access Blocking Order" as contained in Section 12, number 3:
The Law Enforcement Department may direct the NCC [Nigerian Communications Commission – the regulatory agency for the telecommunication industry] to order the internet access service provider to take reasonable steps to disable access by end-users in Nigeria.
Internet service providers must comply with this blocking order or risk upon conviction a fine within the range of 5 to 10 million naira [$14,000-28,000 USD].
In addition, the bill under consideration indemnifies the internet service providers from any "civil or criminal liability" incurred from a lawsuit brought against them for "complying to any access blocking order", according to section 12, number 5.
The human rights violations get murkier because the law grants the police a legal license to command an access-blocking order at whim.
Section 15a states that only the "initiative" of the police in face of "overwhelming sufficing evidence" is needed to cancel an internet shutdown in the country.
Consequently, "no appeal may be made to the High Court" [Section 13(2)] by any party to revoke such a ban without first applying to the police to revoke an existing blocking order.
The implications of this are obvious — no one can resort to the courts for redress in the face of this violation while the blocking order persists.
The lawmakers behind the social media bill
Three lawmakers seem to be the arrowhead of the bill in the Senate, the upper house of Nigeria’s parliament: Mohammed Sani Musa (the sponsor of the bill), Abba Moro and Elisha Abbo.
Mohammed Sani Musa’s company, Activate Technologies Limited, supplied the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) machine used for the 2019 general elections, while he was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for Niger East Senatorial district, according to the investigate outlet, Premium Times.
This is an allegation that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) admitted.
Musa’s conflict of interest raised some doubts about the true independence of Nigeria’s election umpire in the last election.
Ishaku Elisha Abbo of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is a senator representing the Adamawa North Senatorial District in Adamawa State, in northeast Nigerian.
In July 2019, in the presence of a police officer, Abbo assaulted a female staff member in an adult sex toy store in Abuja.
After a video of the assault went viral on social media, Abbo offered a public apology.
Abba Moro, also with the PDP, is the senator representing Benue South district, northcentral Nigeria.
On March 15, 2014, Moro, as minister of interior, was responsible for the Nigerian Immigration Recruitment tragedy in which about 6 million Nigerian youths who applied for 4,000 vacant positions in Nigerian Immigration Service were forced to assemble in various recruitment locations in the country.
The resulting stampede due to overcrowding led to about 20 deaths and multiple injuries.
Moro was a recipient of part of the application fees paid by the job-seekers amounting to 675 million naira [about $1.8 million USD].
Moro not only enriched himself but also bypassed the extant procurement laws for the Immigration Service.
"No need for silence, fear or self-pity" – #SayNoToSocialMediaBill!
Using the hashtag #SayNoToSocialMediaBill, Nigerian netizens took to Twitter to express their collective indignation:
In a statement, Amnesty International condemned the use of "laws to justify human rights violations" because it will not only stop Nigerians "from speaking their minds" but will also "send them to jail for doing so".
The parliament, under the pretext of curbing mis- and disinformation, is considering the enactment of a draconian law.
Ironically, the greatest propagators of false information online are political actors.
Both Nigeria's ruling and main opposition parties turned Twitter into a minefield of ethnic hate speech, disinformation and propaganda during the 2019 presidential elections.

Social media propelled ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during the Nigerian elections
Twitter was a minefield of false information during the 2019 Nigerian elections
In these troubling times of freedom of expression in Nigeria, the wise charge from American writer Toni Morrison evokes hope:
This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear.
We speak, we write, we do language.
The bill is currently at its second reading in the Senate. To become law, it will need to move to committee stage where legislators will review it.
The committee presents its report to Parliament, the bill is debated, a clean copy is re-presented to the Senate for a final vote and then, there's the presidential assent.
The Parliament must be hard-pressed to throw out the social media bill in its entirety.
This is because Africa’s most populous country will slide smoothly into full dictatorship once freedom of expression has been extinguished.
Tanzania high court upholds ruling to end child marriage despite attempts to repeal it
"This is the best decision the court has ever made"
Schoolgirls in Tanzania pose for a photo on July 10, 2007. Photo by Fanny Schertzer, used with permission via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0.
In October 2019, Tanzania's high court upheld the landmark 2016 ruling that increased the minimum age of marriage for girls and boys to 18.
The Tanzanian government attempted to repeal this decision, claiming that girls mature earlier and marriage is a form of protection for pregnant young women, and should, therefore, be allowed to marry earlier than 18.
But on October 23, 2019, the Tanzanian government lost its appeal and the high court ruling remains: The marriage age for both males and females is 18, reinforcing the ban on child marriage in Tanzania.
According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Tanzania has one of the highest prevalence rates of child marriage in the world.
Netizens were quick to express their delight over the ruling.
Some congratulated Rebeca Z. Gyumi, the petitioner and respondent behind this case.
Gyumi is the founder and executive director of Msichana Initiative (Young Woman Initiative), a Tanzanian nongovernmental organization that empowers girls through education.
The fight to end child marriage in Tanzania
In 2016, Gyumi challenged the constitutionality of the Law of Marriage Act, 2002 (LMA) that allowed females under the age of 18 to get married.
According to Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), 36 percent of women aged 25-49 get married before their 18th birthday compared to only 5 percent for men the same age.
The LMA allowed girls as young as 14 to get married with consent from a court and age 15 with the consent of the parents whereas 18 years was the minimum age for a male.
Through her attorneys, Gyumi argued that the LMA provisions were discriminatory for giving preferential treatment to males in the matter of eligible marriage age.
They further argued that the provisions infringed the right to equality and they were too vague and too susceptible to arbitrary interpretation to deny female children their right to education.
Gyumi petitioned the High Court to find the provisions of LMA null and void.
The High Court never declared the provisions in the LMA null and void.
But they found the provisions unconstitutional and gave the government one year to correct the anomalies in the LMA provisions.
Through the attorney general, the government was directed to put 18 years as the eligible age of marriage for both females and males.
However, then-Attorney General George Masaju was aggrieved by the ruling and immediately served a notice of appeal to the High Court:
Official: I've been served government documents of appeal in the case of #childmarriage. Case number 204 of September 2017.

Grounds for appeal
In four months of court proceedings, the government sought to appeal the 2016 ruling that required the revision of the provisions LMA that allowed girls to be married at the age of 15.
The appellant, represented by principal state attorneys, Mark Mulwambo and Alesia Mbuya, provided biological differences and customary and Islamic laws as grounds for the appeal.
Ms. Mbuya argued that biological differences put boys and girls in "different categories" and that therefore, the law treats them differently.
She argued that because girls matured earlier, the law took that into consideration. She argued that marriage could protect unmarried girls who get pregnant at an early age.
Further, she argued the court erred by “equating the age of the child and the age of marriage,” meaning that the court should consider male and female children differently when it comes to marriageable age.
Netizens were quick to criticize the grounds the appellant provided in court.

Gender equality
The court’s ruling is a step toward eliminating harmful practices and ending all forms of discrimination against girls in Tanzania.
According to the United Nations, in order to achieve gender equality by 2030, governments need to change discriminatory laws and adopt legislation that proactively advances equality.
Data shows that the age of marriage is directly related to levels of education and wealth (TDHS 201).
In Tanzania, there is a 6-year difference between the age of marriage between girls with no education and girls with secondary or higher education.
In Tanzania, it is illegal to impregnate or marry schoolgirls with 30-year imprisonment as punishment.
Pregnant schoolgirls are not allowed to return to school even after they have given birth.
The ban on child marriage will protect all girls, regardless of their school enrollment status.
In Tanzania, child marriage bars girls from education and leads to school dropout, according to data from the Tanzania National Survey, 2017).
This ban creates better conditions for schoolgirls to finish school without barriers.
Even so, impregnated schoolgirls are still faced with an unconstitutional ruling that prohibits them from returning to school.
Kanye West's use of Jamaican symbols sparks national dialogue on ‘branding’
Jamaica-themed merchandise appeared in the online store

American rapper Kanye West brought his "Sunday Service" pop-up concert to Kingston, Jamaica, at the start of its National Heroes Day holiday weekend (October 19-21, 2019).
This was the first time the rapper had taken his huge gospel choir outside the United States, reportedly at the request of a Jamaican member of his staff.
However, the event was besieged with criticism from the outset, culminating with West's unapproved use of Jamaican emblems on merchandise being sold on his website.
With just two days’ notice, the free concert took place at Emancipation Park in Kingston, the capital city — a location that jarred some commentators because of controversial comments West had made about slavery during a media interview in May 2018.
The park was opened in 2002 in honour of the "full freedom" of 300,000 slaves in Jamaica on August 1, 1838.
That may have been the first bone of contention around the concert, but it was not the last.
Even as Culture Minister Olivia "Babsy" Grange responded to early criticism by saying the country was benefitting from the concert, one music promoter felt the show, which was livestreamed on the Sunday Service website, "upstaged" other cultural activities over Heroes Day weekend.
In addition, Kingston residents, who suffered unusually heavy traffic flows throughout the week, predicted chaos and confusion during the evening rush hour.
Nevertheless, the concert went smoothly, several thousand Jamaicans enjoyed the show and Jamaican media companies earned online kudos for their flawless production:
Word on the street is that there may be a move by [Sunday Service] to seek patent/ownership rights on the Kingston, Jamaica logos as well as the fabled streamer-tailed humming bird.
I have done a fair amount of online searches for information to corroborate the claim without luck but have come across their online release of merchandise bearing these landmark symbols, which coincided with the concert...
Jamaica’s reality is that successive political administrations have never fully appreciated the economic value of the brand "Jamaica" nor the symbols that [represent] that brand including its flag and its coat of arms.
The same is true for our music and its associated brand marks, Ska, Mento, Rock Steady, Reggae among others.
That Jamaica was blindsided by the release of clothing bearing the island’s important symbols is a classic case of guerilla marketing.
Having a concert to promote the line at the historic Emancipation Park provides tacit assent of not only the line of garments by the government and people of Jamaica, but also of the use of the country’s national symbols in their creation.
I have noticed that there is now hurried pushback by the Ministry of Culture as well as from the Mayor of Kingston. Both should realize that this isn’t a bottle that will be easy to re-cork.
I hope that the government has good lawyers.
Indeed, lawyers may still have quite a bit of work to do to untangle the confusion surrounding the use of Jamaica's national symbols.
Deadly police raids in Guinea as President Alpha Condé clings to power
"Cities have been paralyzed"
Screenshot from a France 24 news flash about the situation in Guinea.
Police violence erupted in Guinea on October 14, resulting in the death of several people and massive arrests, following demonstrations protesting against current president Alpha Condé's plans to modify the constitution to run for a third term.
The streets of the capital, Conakry, and other cities have turned into battlefields between law enforcement forces and demonstrators.
Police forces have the advantage of new legal privileges that allow them to use deadly force if they deem it necessary for security reasons.
The demonstrations have already killed six people, including one police officer, and wounded many.

Demonstrators oppose any change to the constitution seen as an attempt by the president to run legally for a third mandate.
Indeed, the constitution limits the total number of presidential mandates to two in a row. Condé, now 81, should end his mandate in October 2020.
Demonstrators are particularly vulnerable as they operate in violation of the law, as Human Rights Watch reminds:
Translation Original Quote
The government of Guinea has effectively banned street protests for more than a year, citing threats to public security, Human Rights Watch said today.
Local authorities have prohibited at least 20 political or other demonstrations.
Security forces have tear gassed those who defy the ban, and arrested dozens of demonstrators.
Regarding the political situation, the government is delivering conflicting messages: On October 13, President Condé welcomed a dialogue:
Translation Original Quote
Alpha Condé has reiterated his call for a responsible dialogue and for a permanent process of discussions in order to iron out differences and answer all the challenges the country is facing.
Yet, Ahmed Tidiane Traoré, a presidential counselor, stated the following day on October 12, —two days before the demonstrations started, — to a crowd of RPG youth [ruling Reunion of the People of Guinea party]:
Translation Original Quote
We invite the party's youth to remain vigilant in the districts.
They [the opposition activists] have stocked use tires in wholes, we invite young people from the party to get those tires out, prevent them from acting, get those hidden tires, do not attack anyone, do not destroy anything, just defend yourselves.
All evil-doers will be found and shown to the people.
This double talk amongst those in power has further angered the opposition and civil society, according to the site globalguinee.info:
Translation Original Quote
October 14, 2019, is a dark Monday, if not black, responding to the call made by the FNDC [National Front for the Defense of the Constitution], Guineans took massively to the streets to oppose the project of constitutional changes.
Clashes were reported in different districts of the Guinean capital.
Business in the administrative center of Kalou was almost entirely stopped.
Inside the country, people also responded to the call in Middle and Lower Guinea.
In the forest and in Higher Guinea, not so much.
Yet, cities have been paralyzed.
Expressing himself on benbere.org, a Malian platform for youth, Malian blogger Adam Thiam writes:
Translation Original Quote
Serious things are now happening in Guinea, with incendiary escalation, almost random dead demonstrators riddles with bullets, blood trails on pavements with barricades and crossroads smoking with tires in flames and tear gas.
Netizens have denounced the violence on social media:
Just like Blaise Compaoré [Burkinabé politician] Alpha Condé is going straight to the abyss, Will he be able to hear the angry shouting of his compatriots?
The very near future will tell us. Meanwhile, the boat is sinking.
On October 15, Guinean journalist Bhiye Bary wrote:
Hamdallaye pharmacy (#Conakry): certain citizens woken up by the police forces early this morning.
According to a local citizen, the police forces are breaking down doors and looting houses.
S. Nkola Matamba, a writer and human rights activist from the Democratic Republic of Congo, shared his bitterness:
A former member of the opposition, and now devoured by the desire to change the law to allow a third mandate, maybe to remain on the throne till the end, Alpha Condé embodies of of the dark sides of the kind of Africa that keeps taking us down!
People of Guinea, have courage!
#GUINÉE – It's simply appalling. First day of demonstration against a third mandate for Condé and here we are with an outcome of victims and dead people.
This craziness of politicians who want to remain head of state for life Amoulanfe— Cheikh Fall™ (@cypher007) October 14, 2019
Guinean activist Macky Darsalam noted attempts made to manipulate public opinion:
The Guinean opposition seems defenseless in the face of such attacks: the deputies of all opposition parties have stopped participating in parliamentary debates since October 11, 2019.
Violence against these parties has taken on radical forms, as the site mediaguinee.org notes:
Translation Original Quote
...at the headquarter of the Union of Republican Forces (URF) of Sidya Touré district, clashes took place between certain members of the opposition and pro-government militants who had taken measures the day before to prevent any unauthorized demonstration in the stronghold of the ruling party.
The clashes ended with a ransacked office of the URF and the arrest of six people whose identity and party affiliation remain yet unknown to the public.
#SexForGrades: A new documentary exposes sexual harassment at West African universities
Victims fear a backlash and are often unwilling to talk
This masked victim was repeatedly sexually abused by Boniface Igbeneghu, a professor in University of Lagos, Nigeria (Screenshot from BBC #SexForGrades video)
#SexForGrades, a BBC documentary on sexual harassment of female students by university professors in Nigeria and Ghana, has ignited heated online conversation and raises many questions about how to put an end to it:
The groundbreaking investigation, released on October 7, 2019, was anchored by journalist Kiki Mordi, who was forced to abandon her own university degree because she refused to yield to the sexual advances by a university teacher who kept failing her:
Boniface Igbeneghu, University of Lagos, is caught sexually harassing female students in an undercover investigation by the BBC.
Screenshot from BBC #SexForGrades video.
The nearly one-year investigation revealed the scandal of “sex for grades” crises at two West African universities: Nigeria's University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the University of Ghana.
Nigeria's Boniface Igbeneghu, a professor in UNILAG'S faculty of art and an evangelical pastor of local Foursquare Gospel Church, Lagos, was one of the teachers busted by the investigation.
Igbenegbu is seen in the BBC video sexually propositioning an undercover BBC reporter who pretended to be a 17-year-old seeking university admission. Igbenegu can be heard saying:
Don’t you know you are a beautiful girl?
Do you know I am a pastor and I am in my 50's but if I want a girl of 17 years, all I need is a sweet tongue and put some money...
In a final meeting between the pair, Igbenegbu switched off the lights, asked her for a kiss and went ahead to hug her in his locked office.
Foursquare Gospel Church has suspended Igbeneghu "from all ministerial assignments".
Similarly, the University of Lagos has barred Igbeneghu from the school and also ordered the shutdown of the staff club’s "cold room", used by senior staff to hold parties attended by young female students and staff.
Recounting the trauma of years past
This exposé ignited reactions of cataclysmic proportions from Nigerians online with the trending hashtag #SexForGrades on Twitter.
Many female Twitter users recount their own experiences of sexual harassment:
Lola Shoneyin, book festival curator and author, recounted the "terrible shame" she felt after she was touched inappropriately by a university Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC):
Philandering university professors have for decades debased female students in Nigerian tertiary institutions.
However, it is usually difficult to prosecute perpetrators because victims are afraid of the backlash and unwilling to talk due to deep trauma associated with these abuses.
In 2016, the "Sexual Harassment in Tertiary Education Institution Prohibition Bill", passed by the Nigerian Senate prescribed a 5-year jail term for lecturers and educators convicted of sexually harassing students.
However, the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities opposed the bill, claiming that it was discriminatory since it targeted teachers and that it undermined university autonomy.
The opposition to the bill may have led to the death of that legislation — which did not get presidential assent.
Is #SexForGrades another #ChurchToo movement?
In July this year, Nigeria's celebrity photographer, Busola Dakolo, accused Biodun Fatoyinbo, the lead pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), of forcefully raping her when she was 16.

Nigerian Evangelical preacher embroiled in rape accusations
Over the past six years, the flamboyant Fatoyinbo has been plagued by allegations of rape and sexual abuse.
However, the emotional interview during which Dakolo accused Fatoyinbo ignited a national reaction online.
For days, #ChurchToo — a national iteration of the global #MeToo movement — trended on social media in Nigeria.
This agitation soon morphed from online to street protests in major Nigerian cities like Lagos and Abuja.
The #ChurchToo movement called on the government to take "the issue of violence against women and girls seriously".
The #ChurchToo revealed the silent but "horrific thriving rape culture, especially within religious circles" in Nigeria.
It provided an opportunity for women to speak out.
Like the #ChurchToo movement, the #SexForGrades outcry has again revealed the realities of sexual violence against women and the abuse of power that allows this sexual violence to thrive.
Will this hashtag lead to an offline advocacy movement that pushes for reforms to ensure that universities are safe places for women?
Time will tell.
Zanzibar's one and only music academy on the brink of closure
Dhow Countries Music Academy promotes Swahili culture through music
Students from the Dhow Countries Music Academy (DCMA) rehearse the qanun, flute, drum and piano at the Old Customs House, Stone Town, Zanzibar, 2019. Photo courtesy of the DCMA.
Thousands of visitors to the historic city of Stone Town, Zanzibar, have followed the sound of music to the Dhow Countries Music Academy (DCMA), a music school that promotes and preserves the islands’ musical traditions of the Swahili Coast along the Indian Ocean.
Since 2002, the school has promoted and preserved the Zanzibar's unique mix of Arab, Indian and African cultures through music.
After 17 years, the school faces a financial crisis that threatens its closure.
Nearly 70% of its 80 full-time students can't afford to pay their tuition, which comes to about $13 USD per month, according to an official DCMA press release.
While the school has received support over the years from international donors and diplomatic missions, they face a gap in funding that may force them to shut their doors at the historic Old Customs House.
Without crucial funds to continue, DCMA students and staff fear that the soulful sounds that flow through the hallways of this iconic institution that make these islands sing — may cease.
The school not only teaches and promotes traditional culture and heritage through music, but it's also home to a community of young musicians who seek alternatives to making a living as creatives.
A DCMA student learns the qanun, a featured instrument in classical taarab songs. Photo courtesy of the DCMA.
"We [have started] to face a very challenging financial moment", said Alessia Lombardo, managing director of the DCMA, in an official DCMA video.
"From now to the next six months, we are not sure that we can guarantee the salaries to our teachers and staff".
At the moment, 19 master teachers and small core staff have gone without salaries for over three months as the school struggles to secure strong funding partnerships and explore sustainable funding models for a school.
While the archipelago is known as a tourist destination for its pristine beaches and luxury hotels, the majority of local people struggle with high unemployment even as poverty has slightly decreased, according to The World Bank.
For 17 years, the DCMA has worked tirelessly to promote and protect Zanzibar’s rich heritage and traditions through music.
The birthplace of legendary taarab singers Siti Binti Saad and Fatuma Binti Baraka, or Bi. Kidude, Zanzibar is home to musical genres that emerged through cultural exchange and collaboration along the Swahili Coast for hundreds of years.
Today, students can learn traditional musical genres like taarab, ngoma and kidumbak, along with instruments like drums, qanun and oud, as gatekeepers — and interpreters — of culture and tradition.
Neema Surri, a violin player at the DCMA, has been studying the violin since the age of 9.
"I know many young people who would like to study music but they can’t afford the minimal tuition fee because they are poor and unemployed", Surri said in the DCMA video.

After completing DCMA workshops, certificate and diploma courses, many DCMA students go on to perform on world stages as award-winning bands and solo artists.
Zanzibar’s Amina Omar Juma, a former DCMA student and current DCMA teacher, recently returned from a tour in South Africa with her critically acclaimed, "Siti and the Band", known for "fusing the roots" by blending traditional taarab sounds with contemporary, layered rhythms.
She and other band members, also former DCMA students, released their first full album, "Fusing the Roots", in 2018, going on to perform at Sauti za Busara, East Africa's largest music festival, that same year.
Here's Siti and the Band's "Nielewe" ("Understand Me") and music video, depicting scenes from Zanzibar while telling the story of a woman who experiences domestic abuse and dreams of life in music, much like Omar Juma's personal story:

A history of cultural crossroads and collaboration
Over 15,000 visitors have passed through the academy’s iconic building to enjoy live performances, workshops and classes and interact with passionate DCMA musicians who represent the future of Zanzibar culture and heritage, according to the DCMA.
Drawing from a complex history of Indian, Arab and African exchange, the school celebrates the influence of "dhow countries", with inspiration from cultures that converged along the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.
The Omani Sultanate, a "major maritime force from the 17th to 19th centuries", shifted its seat of power from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1840.
From Stone Town, Omani kings oversaw elaborate systems of maritime trade, including cloves, gold, and textiles, powered by strong winds that set dhows — traditional Arab vessels — sailing across the Indian Ocean, from India to Oman to East Africa.
Young Zanzibaris recognize the importance of connecting with the past to determine their future and the music created today expresses that desire to bridge the old with the new.
DCMA students and teachers recently formed "TaraJazz", a blend of traditional taarab and modern jazz.
Their violinist, Felician Mussa, 20, has only been studying the violin for 3.5 years; TaraJazz is one of the most sought-after bands on the islands, captured here by photographer Aline Coquelle:
The Swahili coast tells the story of epic cultural exchanges and the DCMA continues this tradition through its musical collaborations.
Every year, the school hosts an initiative called "Swahili Encounters", matching well-known musicians hailing from Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America with DCMA students to create original musical compositions within a week-long period.
At the end of the "encounter", the newly-formed collaboration performs at Sauti za Busara, and many of these collaborations turn into life-time friendships that transcend the boundaries of language and culture, proving music is a universal language.
DCMA offers weekly live performances showcasing students’ talents and collaborations with visiting musicians, Stone Town, Zanzibar, 2019. Photo courtesy of DCMA.
The DCMA recognizes that music empowers and unites people across cultures — and it also employs talented youth living in a struggling economy with limited job opportunities.
For the 1,800 students who have trained at the DCMA, this is the only musical home they know, where they can learn and grow as professional musicians and artists.
One traveler from Spain, who recently visited the DCMA, wrote on TripAdvisor: "Personally, meeting the musicians was the best piece of my time on this island".
As Zanzibar’s tourism sector rapidly grows, the DCMA believes that music plays an essential role in the celebration, preservation and promotion of Swahili culture, heritage and history.
Zanzibar is far more than its beaches and luxury hotels — it’s a place bursting with talent that stems from an extraordinary history of cultural connection and collaboration.

Superstition and lack of awareness behind witch-hunting in India

On 20 July, four elderly people were lynched by a mob in the Gumla District of Jharkhand, India after being accused of practicing witchcraft.
According to reports, the victims were accused of causing a man's death and they were eventually found guilty of witchcraft by a Panchayat (a village assembly).
The victims were dragged out of their homes and beaten to death by masked men wielding sticks.
Eight of the attackers were subsequently arrested by police.
According to police data published by The Times of India, witch-hunting in Jharkhand has claimed 123 lives from May 2016 to May 2019.
Across the country, 134 people were killed for the alleged use of "black magic" in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.
A Perpetual Malady
"Witch-hunting is not new in Jharkhand", says Prem Chand, the Founding Chairman of the Free Legal Aid Committee (FLAC) in Jharkhand, in a telephonic interview.
FLAC has been instrumental in bringing about legislation against witch-hunting in Jharkhand.
The organisation first began working in this area in 1991 when a woman was accused by her neighbour of causing a boy’s death.
An irate mob attacked her and killed her husband and son.
She sustained injuries.
When Prem Chand and his colleagues visited the offenders in the prison, they were met with defiance:
They told us that they stood by their accusation.
They also shared a belief that when the blood of a woman branded as a witch falls on the ground, she loses her so-called powers of sorcery.
Prem Chand says that it affects specific sectors of the population:
Usually, it is the women from the weaker sections of the society and economically backward regions that are targeted.
The victims are mostly Adivasis, Harijans and Dalits.
It is an assault on the dignity of women and a violation of constitutional rights for a dignified life for every human being.
The Social and Political Realities
Activists say that deeply rooted superstitions prevalent in the hinterlands are a major cause behind the practice.
A lack of education, poor health facilities and economic backwardness mark the regions where these practices are prevalent.
The cases so far show that often a rumor started by someone is enough to get the ball rolling.
Despite the laws enacted by various Indian states which declare witch-hunting to be illegal, participants in these cases see it as a form of self-defense.
It is also used as an excuse for grabbing resources owned by women, exacting revenge or even exploiting women for sex.
According to Prem Chand:
The premise is that once you brand a woman as a witch, you can subject her to any treatment.
However, it is important to note that the practice is used as a justification for exploitation and is not a cause behind it per se.
Ironically, the panchayat often provides tacit approval for branding a person a witch even if does not pass ruling on the punishment to be meted out.
In addition to the elected panchayat, there are self-styled caste panchayats with no legal mandate whatsoever that operate in certain parts of the country.
These bodies pass verdicts and mete out punishments and remain largely unchallenged.
An incident in Ajmer district of Rajasthan in 2017 reported involvement of caste panchayat leading to the death of a 40-year-old woman.
Legally, the courts can take action against such verdicts in case of both elected panchayats and caste panchayats.
However, the victims seldom get the opportunity to reach a court of law before they become targets of mobs.
Witch-hunting across India
Jharkhand has recorded the highest number of crimes committed in the name of witch-hunting but it is not the only state.
Cases of witch-hunting have been reported from Chattisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat, West Bengal Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan too.
In a chilling incident in 2014, Debjani Bora, an Indian athlete had become a target in Assam.
According to Debjani’s statements, she was accused of being the cause of several deaths in Cherekali village located 180 km from Guwahati, the capital of the eastern state in India.
She was allegedly named by a headman of a village prayer hall and brutally assaulted by the villagers.
2017 witnessed several cases in the state of Rajasthan.
Among these, a 40-year-old woman Kanya Devi was attacked and beaten to death after being accused by her family members in Ajmer district of the state.
Victims and Survivors
People blame accused witches for causing a slew of misfortunes: the death of a person or animal, droughts, crop failures, etc.
The attacks on these women (and some men) are vicious and inhuman.
At times, the accusations and punishment are meted out by their families.
Some have lived to tell the tale and fight. Chutni Mahato of Saraikela in Jharkhand is one of them.
People from the region call her a "tigress".
She was accused of practicing witchcraft in 1995.
Since then, she has transformed into an activist crusading against the victimization of women in the name of witch-hunting with the help of NGOs working to end the practice.
Chutni expresses how the lack of resources often makes it a struggle to fight against the practice.
I wish there was more support from the authorities and government for the work that we are doing here.
However, I have suffered because of this practice.
When someone comes to me for help, I am always going to stand by them, she said in a telephonic interview.
Formulating Public Opinion
Both the survivors and activists feel that there is a lack of public opinion in support of ending witch-hunting.
The activists who were interviewed for this story expressed a paucity of political will and intellectual engagement to provide the momentum required for the campaign against the heinous practice to succeed.
A silver lining in this dark cloud is that people working against the practice believe that the situation can be turned around.
According to Prem Chand:
The efforts for ending witch hunting can be modeled on the same principles that the government has used for promoting other social problems such as the literacy mission.
Also, the intellectuals would have to lend their support to the cause to mold the public opinion.
The sources for the story were interviewed with the assistance of B. Vijay Murty, a journalist and resident editor based out of Jharkhand.
Caring for Myanmar’s orphaned elephants
A camp staff member bottle-feeds Ayeyar Maung. / Aung Kyaw Htet / The Irrawaddy
This article by Aung Kyaw Htet is from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.
When forestry staff found her deep in the jungle of the Irrawaddy Delta, Ayeyar Sein was three months old.
One of her legs was caught in a steel trap laid by poachers.
Workers from the government’s timber extraction enterprise saved her and sent her to an elephant camp in Bago Region for treatment.
Now she is one of eight calves being sheltered at Wingabaw, Myanmar’s only elephant orphanage.
Another calf, Ayeyar Maung, endured a similar ordeal.
Before his arrival at the camp, the six-month-old was snared in a wire trap.
As he was stuck among a group of boulders in the same forest where Ayeyar Sein was found, his herd was forced to leave him behind.
However, forest workers were able to free him and he arrived at the camp last year.
They are the youngest of the orphans at the camp; the oldest is nearly four years their senior.
All have tragic backgrounds.
Some were left by their herds, while others were orphaned when their parents were killed by poachers.
At Wingabaw Camp, the motherless calves rely on baby formula provided daily by staff.
They are allowed to roam in the forest in the morning and wash in a nearby stream before returning to the camp.
Currently, it is believed that Myanmar has nearly 1,500 wild elephants.
But they are under serious threat from poaching, with elephants being killed at the alarming rate of one a week.
Tobago's coral bleaching alert makes it clear there is ‘no alternative’ to fighting the climate crisis
The island's reefs are on "Bleaching Alert Level One"

Tobago's coral reefs are an integral part of both the island's marine ecosystem and its economy.
Home to numerous species of marine life (and a main source of fish for local fishermen), they also protect the coastline from wave erosion and the effects of tropical storms.
Popular spots like Buccoo Reef are also popular tourist attractions.
But after a press release issued by the country's Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) on August 22, 2019, in which it warned that — based on findings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch — Tobago's coral reefs have been placed on a watch for "Bleaching Alert Level One", all eyes are on the island.
There is a distinct possibility that the bleaching could advance to Level Two within a matter of weeks, which would threatens not only the existence of the reefs themselves, but also the island's marine life and people.
What exactly is bleaching?
Corals coexist with and become home to symbiotic algae, helping it store nutrients and remove waste.
In return, the algae gives the coral the energy it needs to grow, but drastic changes in water temperature can threaten this cooperative relationship.
When water becomes too hot (or too cold) the corals expel the algae — and with it, its main source of food.
Eventually, the coral starves to death; the most noticeable outward sign of this phenomenon is that the coral loses its colour, going from shades of brown and green to a crisp, brittle, bone white.
Bleaching Level Alert One means that the corals are extremely likely to start the bleaching process.
The IMA therefore suggests that both biologists and citizens should keep an eye out for signs of bleaching over the next 9-12 weeks.
Level Two bleaching would be an indication of widespread coral bleaching and coral mortality.
What causes it?
According to local coral reef ecologist Anjani Ganase, the main contributors to coral bleaching in Tobago are the warmer water temperatures — a result of climate change.
Via email, Ganase explained that the ocean absorbs much of the heat in the atmosphere, which in turn causes the water — especially shallower bodies of water, like the Caribbean Sea — to heat up.
In fact, NOAA's 12-week outlook extends well past Tobago to the reefs of the Lesser Antilles.
Other reefs around the region, most notably in parts of the Greater Antilles and Cuba, have already been placed on a Level Two Bleaching Alert:
What are its effects?
Coral bleaching is a huge threat.
Because reefs provide fishes with a habitat that allows them to have access to shelter, food and most importantly, shelter for their young until they are ready to survive in the wider ocean, the proposition of losing them will impact the ability of fish species to survive.
It will also negatively affect the livelihoods of local fishermen.
Tobago relies very heavily on its local tourism industry; its reefs reportedly attract around 40 per cent of the island's tourists.
Should coral bleaching continue, there will be fewer thriving reefs for people to explore and quite likely, a reduction in tourism dollars, which affects a range of hospitality-related industries: hotels, restaurants, transport services and tour companies.
The great irony is that, as tropical storms intensify as a result of the climate crisis, reefs are needed more than ever to absorb the force of waves and create a buffer between the ocean and the shore — but the reefs are compromised by global heating.
Studies show that coral reefs protect around 90 per cent of Tobago's shoreline from wave-induced erosion.
In a feature address at the International Year of the Reef at the University of the West Indies in 2018, Professor John Agard said that this function will only become more important as storm intensities increase and sea levels rise.
What can we do to stop it?
Ganase says the lack of proper management that has allowed overfishing and pollution to go unchecked has made Tobago's coral bleaching worse.
If this continues, she explains, active management and protection will be critical for full recovery and growth:
Ideally, coral reefs should be closed to the public and placed into an intensive recovery programme to ensure healthy fish communities and water quality that will support coral growth and recruitment.
She added:
Individual actions to reduce our carbon footprintare are always warranted but we also need citizens to demand more action from our governments to provide the infrastructure, resources and education for climate conservation and adaptation.
Communities need the support to manage and conserve our natural resources not just from governments but from businesses and corporations that also utilise these resources.
There is a pressing need for regional island governments to demand an international effort in tackling the climate crisis.
On September 11, 2019, Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley addressed this issue at the United Nations’ Geneva headquarters, urging larger nations to do better in fighting climate change.
The islands of the Caribbean, she said, "do not have the luxury of time because [we] are busy trying to survive".
Ganase agrees about the urgency of the matter.
Any and all forms of aid in tackling climate change and coral bleaching, she said, especially on political levels, "requires effort":
It's not going to be easy as seen internationally, but there is really no alternative.
Travel: An extreme sport for Africans
Visa applications can feel like a sacrifice to the gods

In 2019, Temitayo Olofinlua, a Nigerian writer and academic, was denied a visa to attend the European Conference on African Studies in Edinburgh, UK.
The British High Commission in Nigeria said they were “not satisfied” that Olofinlua would leave the UK at the end of her trip.
The visa refusal was later rescinded by the UK Home Office. Olofinlua went to the conference and has since returned to Nigeria.
Others have not been as lucky. In April 2019, the UK visa authorities prevented 24 out of 25 African scientists working on infectious diseases from joining their colleagues at various events taking place as part of the London School of Economics Africa Summit.
The people most invested in and best-positioned to tackle the problem of diseases on their continent, were barred from participating in an event about “the challenge of pandemic preparedness.”
‘You won't come back!’
Barring Africans from entry into certain countries is not only humiliating — it also highlights the institutional racism that underpins the notion that African professionals and creatives cannot be trusted to obey the law.
Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country".
The reality, however, is that without a passport and valid visa, this right cannot easily be exercised.
And the ease of getting a visa varies according to nationality.
On the 2019 Henley Passport Index, Japan and Singapore hold the top spot for access to most countries, while Angola, Egypt and Haiti are at the bottom.

Kenyan author Ciku Kimeria describes the indignity of living without "passport privilege".
She notes that even a visa does not guarantee entry because "you still have to deal with the surly immigration official who will suspiciously ask, ‘And what are you here to do?’"
If the answer to this question isn’t to the official’s satisfaction, visitors could find themselves being marched back to the departure gate.
For Africans traveling outside the continent, applying for a visa can feel like offering sacrifices to a ravenous god.
Adéṣínà Ayẹni (Ọmọ Yoòbá), Global Voices Yoruba translation manager, recounts his recent experience trying to procure a visa to Lisbon, Portugal, for the 2019 Creative Commons Summit:
It was the greatest news of my life when I received a mail to deliver a keynote address at the 2019 CC Summit in Lisbon...
On April 18, 2019, some days to my birthday, I submitted my visa application to attend the Lisbon summit at the VFS Global office in Lekki, Lagos.
The summit was slated for May 9-11, 2019, but visa processing takes a minimum 15 days.
On the day I was to depart for Portugal, I still [hadn’t] received my passport...
11 days after the summit elapsed, I received a text from the VFS for collection of my passport.
The elders say, you cannot be at your best when sad.
It is one thing that I was not given a visa to attend the summit, another is that the huge scholarship grant to attend the summit went down the drain, wasted.
I am miserable because I have not been able to refund the scholarship due to the Central Bank of Nigeria’s policy on wire transfers.
It is excruciatingly painful that my right to associate as a free citizen of the global village was violated.
I was stripped of my voice!
For Africans traveling within Africa: A painful irony
It’s difficult for Africans to travel outside Africa — but it can be equally grim to travel within the continent.
Citizens of many countries in the global North can travel to most Africa countries visa-free, or with few restrictions, but the majority of Africans need visas to travel to over half of the other African countries.
Nigerian Global Voices contributor Rosemary Ajayi captures the "struggle of Africans traveling within Africa":
I am happy that we, and many others, are highlighting the challenges Africans face getting Western visas.
This doesn't annoy me as much as the struggles of Africans travelling within Africa.
At RightsCon in Tunis, and GlobalFact in Cape Town, I took the time to ask Africans if they had needed visas.
Just this weekend, I learnt of a Nigerian journalist who was unable to attend GlobalFact because he didn't have a visa.
Let's not talk about how most of the African delegates at RightsCon had to fly out of Africa first, in order to get to Tunis.
Last month, I met an East African journalist applying for a visa to Nigeria. He was asked to supply the driver's license of the professional driver picking him up from the airport!
As Rosemary points out, intra-continental travel is often further complicated by having to travel out of the continent in order to reach a destination within Africa.
At the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regional aviation forum in Accra in June, Ghana's Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia lamented the fact that “a business person from Freetown [Sierra Leone], for example, should travel for nearly two days to go to Banjul (often through a third country) for a journey which a straight-line flight would have taken only one hour.”
The convoluted flight routes are then compounded by the extraordinarily high cost of air travel within the continent.
Is it true that Africans are unlikely to return home?

Between 2010-2017, migrants from sub-Saharan African countries accounted for the largest migrant population in the world after Syria.
Many Africans leave the countries fleeing poverty or violent conflict, to seek asylum, refugee status or permanent residence in North America or Europe.
A 2018 Pew Research study reports that the number of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa "grew by 50% or more between 2010 and 2017, significantly more than the 17% worldwide average increase for the same period".
Sub-Saharan Africans are also emigrating to countries far and wide.
In 2014, over 170,000 migrants without legal documents ferried across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.
Many hailed from sub-Saharan Africa.
In December 2018, Brazilian police rescued 25 sub-Saharan African nationals who had “been at sea for over a month” in the Atlantic Ocean.
The travelers had paid “hundreds of dollars apiece” for the trip from Cape Verde. In June 2019, US Customs and Border Protection in Del Rio, Texas, USA, arrested more than 500 Africans from Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola, for trying to cross into the USA via the Rio Grande River.
While dominant narratives in the media perpetuate Africa as a continent of mass migration driven by poverty or violent conflict, however, Marie-Laurence Flahaux and Hein De Haas, scholars from University of Oxford and University of Amsterdam, respectively, take issue with this stereotype.
Flahaux and De Haas argue that these narratives are propagated not only by "media and politicians" but also by scholars.
Their research shows that migration from the continent is multi-layered and driven by global "processes of development and social transformation" that have increased the "capabilities and aspirations" of Africans’ to migrate — similar to migrants from other parts of the world.
These stereotypical narratives, however, often inform visa policy:
Most countries’ authorities assume that all Africans who travel will not return to their home countries, leaving African visa applicants to bear the burden of proof.
Getting non-African nations to take a more nuanced approach to visa approvals for African nationals is a long battle.
Meanwhile, African nations can take action to improve mobility across the continent.
A common African passport is one step — but it's not enough. The Single African Air Transport market (SAATM), and the Continental Free Trade Agreement, both launched last year, have laid the foundation for some of these shifts, but widespread implementation is still a long way off.
Meanwhile, as an African, to dare to travel is to be subjected to cruel humiliations when travelling outside Africa — or to be jolted out of the fantasy of African unity by the harshness of travelling within the continent.
Either way the visa gods demand more sacrifices, while remaining adamantly intransigent.
Social media propelled ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during the Nigerian elections
Ethnic driven falsehoods spiked on social media during the elections

This story is the first in a two-part series on online ethnic hate speech, disinformation and propaganda during the 2019 Nigeria elections.
You can read the second part here.
Nigeria went to the polls to elect a new president and a national parliament on February 23, 2019.
With two main contenders vying for the presidency, incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari obtained 15 million votes and triumphed over his closest rival, Atiku Abubakar, by a "margin of 56 percent to 41 percent".
Buhari was sworn-in for a second term of four years on May 29, 2019.

However, the election campaign was fought on different fronts, including social media.
There was widespread dissemination of ethnic hate speech at the service of disinformation and propaganda online, particularly on Twitter.
Ethnic hate in Nigeria
Nigeria’s multi-ethnicity – over 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages – has at times been a source of conflict instead of strength.
This becomes particularly obvious during elections when politicians use these divisions to campaign for votes.
Naturally, online conversations in Nigeria have not been devoid of ethnic-induced hate.
Read more: Nigeria: Curbing the tide of ethnic hate — online and off
During the 2015 elections, for instance, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim).
Twitter became a tool for propagating ethnic hate and party politics.
Some thought 2019 would be different because Buhari from the All Progressive Congress (APC) and Abubakar from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) are both Hausa, Fulani Muslims, but that was not the case.
Their vice-presidential candidates – Yemi Osibanjo (APC), a Yoruba, and Peter Obi (PDP), an Igbo, are both Christians— but from different ethnic groups.
It seemed like a repeat of 2015 but now with different protagonists.
The political atmosphere became ethnically-charged in 2017, two years before the elections, creating the conditions for an atmosphere of distrust.
The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a secessionist organization in the southeastern part of the country led by Nnamdi Kanu, also added to the heightened ethnic tensions brewing.
Read more: As ethnic hate speech rises, Nigerian writers push back
Desertification in predominantly-Muslim northern Nigeria led to a southward migration of Nigeria’s cattle herders that ignited violent conflicts with farmers.
The southern Christian communities’ resentment of the influx of Muslim Fulani herders was portrayed in some narratives as an 'Islamisation' force.
The failure of the Nigerian government to investigate these clashes and "bring perpetrators to justice" resulted in the death of about 4,000 people from 2015 to late 2018, according to Amnesty International.
Hence, ethnocentrism was already at an all-time high before the presidential elections in 2019.
The prevailing distrust was a fertile ground for false information – online and offline – during the elections.
Elections and the credibility of online information in Nigeria
The number of internet users in Nigeria grew from 98.3 million in 2017 to 100.5 million in 2018.
Facebook maintains the lead as the social media platform of choice with 22 million users, followed by YouTube (7 million+), Twitter (6 million) and Instagram (5.7 million).
The majority of Nigerian voters are young. Out of the 84 million registered voters for the 2019 General Elections, over half — 51 percent — are young voters aged between 18 and 35, whereas nearly 30 percent are between 36 and 50 years old.
These two groups of voters, which include both digital natives and digital immigrants, form the majority of Nigerian voters who are digitally savvy.
Therefore, it was not surprising that digital media was one of the prominent battlegrounds for election campaigns in 2019.
As a result, the credibility of online information during the 2019 elections suffered great attrition.
False and misleading information, promoted as gospel truth, was amplified by supporters of the two major parties in Nigeria: the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
Based on ethnographic participant observation conducted between October 28, 2018, and May 29, 2019, ethnic hate was employed as a tool for disinformation and propaganda by both sides of the political divide on Twitter Nigeria during the 2019 presidential elections.
These observations were captured as screengrabs of tweets or saved URLs collected over this period.
In terms of ethnically-charged disinformation, some APC supporters accused Obi of being a bigot for purportedly deporting northerners while he was governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria.
Tweets went viral that claimed that Yoruba people were burning shops of Igbo traders in Lagos. Both stories were false and will be explored further in Part II of this essay.
Figure 1: Misinformed propaganda tweet by Festus Keyamo
Figure 2: The true location of the image that Keyamo shared.
In another example, a photograph was used to misconstrue facts. On October 28, 2018, Festus Keyamo, then-media director of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, tweeted an image (Figure 1) of a tree growing between an apparently abandoned Nigerian rail track:
This is how trees grew in-between rail tracks between 1999 and 2015...
Now, this is the 'Completion Era' as the tracks are beginning to roar back to life.” The PDP government was in power between 1999 and 2015.
However, a Nigerian Twitter user later traced back the image to an original Arabic-language tweet (Figure 2) posted earlier that same month.
According to the tweet, the photo is from Lebanon.
Keyamo's intention may have been to show that the Buhari government had surpassed previous administrations on the revamping of the morbid rail lines in the country.
However, the use of an image from a different country made the so-called "gains" questionable.
Figure 3: Ethnic hate speech
Figure 4: El-Rufai later apologized for the “insensitive” tweet shown in Figure 3.
Online ethnic hate speech was also pronounced before, during and after the elections.
In an ethnic slurred tweet (Figure 3) Bashir El-Rufai, son of the Kaduna State Governor, inferred that the Nigerian Civil War was ignited by the Igbo vengeance.
Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a bitter civil war with the secessionist state of Biafra inhabited mostly by the Igbo in the southeastern part of the country.
Hence, according to Bashir El-Rufai, the result of the 2019 elections which was won by his party, the APC, should also be taken as a sweet "revenge" from the Hausa, Fulani.
He later apologized, after a backlash, for his previous "insensitive" tweet as shown in Figure 4.
He also deleted the earlier tweet (Figure 3).
Ethnic-motivated false information on social media during the elections falls into two categories: disinformation and propaganda.
Miroslav Tudjman and Nives Mikelic, communication scholars at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, define disinformation as "intentionally deputed mistaken information with the purpose to mislead the user".
Hence, the intention to pass across inaccurate, distorted and false evidence as true, distinguishes dis-information from misinformation.
Tudjman and Mikelic assert that propaganda is much more than disinformation or misinformation.
This is because propaganda "aims to manipulate the attitudes of the user" through an "accidental or intentional handling with information in [the] communication process".
Thus, propaganda weaponizes biased or inaccurate information for political interests and consequently manipulates perception.
Justifiable fears emerged surrounding 2019 elections because online disinformation and propaganda incites electoral violence but also poses "a threat to reconciliation after the elections".
Part II of this essay will examine how this played out online, especially on Twitter, with specific examples.
This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights through methods such as network shutdowns and disinformation during key political events in seven African countries: Algeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
The project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).
From Kenya to Ethiopia, these men received divine dream ‘maps’ to carve caves
Both men say they received explicit instructions from God
Dunbar caves in southern Ethiopia were dug by Mohammed Yiso Banatah with his bare hands.
He was instructed by Allah to create underground wedding chapels.

On December 26, 2019, BBC Swahili released a video featuring Francisco Ouma, an elder from Busia, western Kenya, who received a message from God to carve a cave.
The message came in the form of a map that he received through his dreams.
Since February 1967, Ouma has followed the divine map delivered in his dream.
Today, his cave has 24 rooms and counting.

Throughout history, many have questioned the veracity of divine intervention through dreams, even casting doubt on one's mental health and stability.
But prophets from Islam, Judaism and Christianity have all testified to messages from God sent through dreams for millennia.
"God brought me something like a map", Ouma told BBC Swahili.
Then, when I was digging, this map is what I followed.
It wasn't just that when I was digging, better to keep digging, no.
Using just a plow and his own two hands, Ouma faced trial and error as he hit on stones that prevented him from digging.
He finally found the right spot to manifest God's cave map in his mind.
In one room, there's a stone with writing on it with the words of Jesus.
Jesus Christ was the one who brought me this news, Ouma said, and then he explained it to me as it was with Moses.
Ouma believes he is bringing back another covenant with God to the world.
The second stage is coming.
This is the first stage of the covenant.
The second is coming.
I can't say for sure what it is now because if I announce it, I may be cheating humanity.
Therefore, I will wait for the report to be given at last, Ouma told BBC Swahili.
The BBC Swahili video has been viewed nearly 50,000 times with over 100 comments and counting.
While some have raised questions about the mental stability of those who claim to receive messages from God through dreams, including a professor quoted in the video, many comments supported people of faith who tune into messages shared through dreams.
One Instagram user wrote:

He hasn't even asked for the help of a tractor or money for his labor. We should not judge this person.
Mohammed Yiso Banatah in 2012 explains the ten dreams through which Allah instructed him to dig underground wedding chapels.

Ethiopia's underground wedding chapels
In southern Ethiopia, a similar testimony exists from an elder named Mohammed Yiso Banatah, who said back in 2012 that he was visited by Allah 33 years ago in a series of ten dreams.
Through the dreams, he received explicit instructions from Allah to ultimately create underground wedding chapel caves.
Known as Dunbar Caves, these elaborate chapels exist on Banatah's roadside property halfway between Hawassa and Shashamene.
Banatah said it was in his third dream that the blueprint for these chapel caves was burned into his consciousness.
You can read my full narrative account of Banatah's dream sequence and what prompted him to start digging what would become his life's work here:
In his final dream, the tenth one in a series back in 1979, a man appeared in his dream who took Mohammed to a small tree on his property and pointed to its roots.
The man showed him exactly where to start digging and told him that his life would depend on it.
At midnight, he saw visions of gold.
Surroundings up close appeared far away and objects farthest away were pulled up close to him.
He was told where, when, and how to begin digging.
The next day, when he woke up, he began to dig into the earth with his bare hands.
These sunlight-flooded caves have been somewhat of a tourist attraction where people stop, pay a modest fee, and tour the quiet stillness at least four meters underground.
Some couples have even arranged wedding ceremonies there.
The architectural genius of these spaces reveals the finery and steadiness of Mohammed’s hand – he’s spent careful hours carving, smoothing, cutting, digging, and designing an intricate series of archways, cosy nooks and hidden rooms within rooms, some that have been furnished with soft mattresses and simple earth-slab shelves, while others are stark and cool with tiny, rounded windows flooding through with secret rays of sunlight appearing out of nowhere.
Caves have carried deep spiritual and metaphorical significance throughout history.
A whole chapter called "Al Kahf" or "The Cave" appears in the Quran.
It features a Christian folktale known as the "People of the Cave", in which youth, tortured for their beliefs, fled their city to find refuge in a cave and fell asleep.
When they awoke and returned, they realized the entire city had become believers.
Why is Donald Trump so popular in Nigeria?
Trump has so many fans in southern Nigeria

United States President Donald Trump has received low ratings across the world for his handling of international affairs — but not in some African countries like Nigeria.
According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre most Nigerians "have confidence" that Trump "will do the right thing in world affairs".
The Pew survey results were gathered from telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted under the direction of Gallup — a Washington, DC, based analytics and advisory company.
Tweepsmap analysis of on Trump’s total followers on Twitter shows that Nigerians ranked in the top five across the world:
Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani explained to The World, a public radio show co-produced by the BBC, that Trump's "tough guy image" strikes a chord in Africa's most populous country:
People admire his tough guy image and his bluntness is entertaining.
He's weird to Americans.
He's strange.
He's different from what you've had.
But we're used to leaders who speak without restraint, who are verbally abusive when they please.
And so, he's not as outlandish to us as he may appear to an American.
The other reason is religion.
Nigerian Christians love Trump.
Cheta Nwanze, Head of Research at SBM Intelligence told Global Voices:
I'd like to see exactly WHERE in Nigeria this survey was conducted.
I'm willing to bet that it was largely in southern Nigeria, which explains the love of Trump.
A lot of his base are evangelical Christians, from whom many Nigerians draw their inspiration.
Nigeria, with an estimated population of 200 million people, has two major religions: Christianity and Islam.
Muslims and Christians make up 50 percent and 48 percent of the Nigerian population respectively.
The methodology of the recent poll states that the study was conducted in Nigerian "local government areas stratified by geopolitical region".
However, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states in northwestern Nigeria were excluded from the study due to security concerns.
Nigeria has 774 local government areas, the grassroots arm of executive governance structure in the country.
There are also six geopolitical regions: North Central, Northwest, Northeast, South-south, Southeast, and Southwest.
Nwanze's position that Christians in southern Nigeria must have formed the core of the sample size for the Pew Research results are not unfounded.
The survey also showed that Nigerian Christians also "have a more favorable opinion of the US (69 percent) than do Muslims (54 percent)".
After the killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, by the United States, Nigeria's police chief issued a national security alert to forestall any disturbances by “domestic interests.”
The Islamic movement in Nigeria described the US airstrike that killed Soleimani as a "declaration of war on Iran".
Trump has been described as “one of the most controversial world leaders in modern times."
Yet, he is clearly adored by many in Nigeria.
Twitter was a minefield of false information during the 2019 Nigerian elections
Ethnic hate speech and disinformation were rife on Twitter
Image remixed by Nwachukwu Egbunike
This story is the second in a two-part series on online ethnic hate speech, disinformation and propaganda during the 2019 Nigeria elections.
You can read the first part here.
In Nigeria, social media has a history of enabling ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during elections.
During the 2015 elections, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim).
Twitter became a tool for propagating ethnic hate and party politics.
The 2019 elections were no exception.
On February 15, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement expressing its concerns over an election campaign "polluted by disinformation".
Nigerians also expressed their concerns.
Journalist Abdulbaqi Jari tweeted:
Disinformation and politics in African countries
A 2019 study by Dani Madrid-Morales, University of Huston and Herman Wasserman, University of Cape Town concluded that "mis- and disinformation campaigns have been used to influence political agendas" in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.
The high exposure to disinformation in social media especially during electoral campaigns, leads to a "distrust" among social media users "because that's where they find 'fake news' most often", Madrid-Morales asserted.
My ethnographic study between October 28, 2018, and May 29, 2019, that covered the 2019 Nigerian elections held on February 23 (to elect a president and a national assembly), and March 9 (to elect governors and state houses of assembly) revealed two major categories of false information: ethnocentric driven disinformation and political propaganda.
Ethnically charged disinformation
Peter Obi, the running mate of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, was a victim of ethnocentric disinformation during the last elections.
Obi was the former governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria.
A Twitter account supporting the Buhari-Osinbajo campaign, Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement, shared a tweet (Figure 1) which accused Obi of "deporting" northerners from Anambra State as governor.
Figure 1: Screenshot of a tweet by Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement accusing Obi of 'deporting' northerners.
Figure 2: Screenshot of a tweet by Nasir El-Rufia
This charge was amplified by Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State and member of the ruling APC, who tweeted (Figure 2) that Obi was "a tribal bigot".
This, according to El-Rufai, made Obi unfit to be a vice president of Nigeria.

What really happened?
In July 2013, 67 Nigerians, mostly from the Igbo ethnic group, "were deported all the way from Lagos and dumped at almost the same spot at the popular Upper Iweka area" in Onitsha, Anambra State, reported the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper.
Obi, who was then the governor of Anambra State, described this action by his Lagos State colleague, Tunde Fashola, as "illegal, unconstitutional, and a blatant violation of the human rights of the deportees".
Following the public fury that this action generated, Premium Times reported that Obi was also guilty of the same action:
In 2011, he repatriated child beggars back to Ebonyi and Akwa Ibom states, both in southern Nigeria.
Figure 3: Screenshot of a tweet by Jubril A. Gawat
While Obi did indeed deport beggars back to states in Southern Nigeria, he did not deport northerners and the accusation tweeted (Figure 1) by the Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement Twitter account was inaccurate.
Rather it was APC's Tunde Fashola, who in December 2014, "deported 70 northerners, found publicly begging" back to Kano State, according to the online investigative newspaper Sahara Reporters.
However, this ethnically motivated disinformation was employed by APC supporters on Twitter to discredit their opponent.
For instance, Jubril A. Gawat recently appointed as Lagos State's senior special assistant on new media tweeted that (Figure 3) a vote for opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar "is a vote for Igbo".
Nigeria is a country where ethnic identities run deep.
These divisions are usually exploited during elections by politicians because of the obvious need to pitch their opponents into opposing camps of "we" versus "them".
Hence, the allegations that Obi deported northerners was meant to re-ignite the ethnic animosities between the Igbo and Hausa, Fulani that led to the Nigerian Civil War.
The aim of these disinformation campaigns was to paint Obi as a Biafran ethnic irredentist.
Located in southeastern Nigeria, the breakaway Republic of Biafra, which lasted for three years through a bitter civil war between 1967 to 1970, is largely populated by the Igbo.
Thus, Figure 3 proclamation that "a vote for Atiku is a vote for Igbo..." was aimed to revive the ghost of the acrimonious ethnic hatred that pitched Hausa against Igbo.
In 2019 elections, this meant that Atiku is a supporter of the Igbo who had once tried to break away from Nigeria.
Statements in Figures 1-3 convey strong emotions capable of reopening pent up memories, which in most cases have still not received closure, from both sides of the divide.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) maintains that disinformation like this targets the "vulnerability or partisan potential of recipients" by turning them into "amplifiers and multipliers".
Ethnically-charged electoral campaigns not only exploit deeply rooted prejudices but also morph recipients into disseminators of false information.
Fabricated claims of Yoruba burning Igbo shops in Lagos
Figure 4: Screenshot of a tweet [flagged and pulled down by Twitter] by Chioma spreading disinformation of Yoruba burning Igbo shops in Lagos
Similarly, ethnocentrism was also used by PDP supporters on Twitter to drive votes against the APC in Lagos State.
Figures 4 and 5 show tweets by a PDP sympathizer alleging that Yoruba had set Igbo shops in Lagos on fire.
The stories were false and were quickly dispelled by the Lagos State Police.
A Facebook post, using nearly the same words from Figure 4, and a picture depicting roads blocked by burning tires, circulated the same false claims.
The photo used was from a February 24, 2017 protest that took place in a province near Pretoria, South Africa, reported African Check.
Figure 5: Screenshot of a tweet spreading disinformation of Yoruba burning Igbo shops in Lagos II
Political propaganda
On February 13, Twitter user Souljah tweeted (Figure 6) that Ballard Partners, a PR firm based in Washington DC, which was allegedly hired as a publicist for the Abubakar presidential campaign, had conducted a poll which predicted a loss for the opposition PDP presidential candidate.
The result of the survey was conveyed in a letter signed by Brian Ballard, head of Ballard Partners, on February 5, and addressed to Olusola Saraki, the Director-General of Abubakar's campaign.
Souljah's tweet went viral with over 1 million likes and 1 million retweets for obvious reasons.
The presidential election was previously slated to hold on February 16 (later postponed to February 23) and, with this poll coming three days before the elections, would have been catastrophic for the opposition PDP.

However, by the evening of February 13, Ballard Partners refuted the said survey (Figure 7) which they described as "fraudulent" and maintained that they had not "conducted any survey research on behalf of the People’s Democratic Party of Nigeria".
Ose Anenih, a PDP supporter reported some of the APC Twitter sympathizers who circulated the fake poll to the Twitter handle of the Nigerian police and the Independent Electoral Commission, the electoral umpire, for "criminally and illegally" trying to "interfere with free and fair elections".
But this was not the only case of weaponizing disinformation for political propaganda that was witnessed online during the elections.
Figure 7: Screenshot of a tweet by Ballard and Partners refuting a fake poll attributed to them.
The many lies of a presidential aide
Figure 8: Screenshot of a tweet by Lauretta Onochie, aide to the Nigerian president
On December 4, 2018, Lauretta Onochie, presidential aide to Buhari [then incumbent presidential candidate] tweeted (Figure 8) a picture with food and 500 naira notes that was purportedly shared with the crowd that attended Abubakar's presidential rally in Sokoto in northwest Nigeria, the previous day.
Onochie's allegations were completely false. In fact, the picture she shared "was taken in February 2017" at an event unrelated to "electioneering", Chuba Ugwu pointed out in a reply to her tweet.
Onochie appears to be a specialist in disseminating falsehoods. The International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), an online news portal, analysed over 1,000 images shared on Twitter by Onochie between August 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019. The analysis revealed that "in at least 12 cases" Onochie "had used inaccurate pictures".
Online hate speech: a crime in Nigeria
Section 26 of Nigeria's Cybercrime Act prohibits "use of threats of violence and insulting statements to persons based on race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin".
Convicted persons risk a five-year jail term or a fine not less than 10 million nairas [about $28,000 United States dollars] or both.
In March this year, Enough is Enough Nigeria (EIE), a youth-based movement and Paradigm Initiative (PI), a digital rights policy and advocacy group, instituted a court case in an Abuja court against Onochie and Gbenga Olorunpomi, an aide to Kogi State governor.
The two organisations compiled instances of hate speech "gathered from online comments" made by Onochie and Olorunpomi which they deemed to be in violation of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act of 2015.

An army of Twitter warriors propagating falsehoods
Most of the instances highlighted above were not mere happenstance. Rather, there was a deliberate and systematic effort to pass off lies as true information.
This is not surprising considering that both APC and PDP engaged an army of online warriors to either "neutralize adverse" social media reports or “fend off” attacks during the campaign periods.
Each side engaged "cyber troops" — "government or political party actors tasked with manipulating public opinion online".
This year's elections were a repeat of 2015, where both APC and PDP engaged in "disinformation, misinformation, propaganda" campaigns on social media that were "carefully designed to hoodwink the unsuspecting electorate", asserts Eshemokha Austin Maho, a Nigerian media scholar.
They achieved this through the creation of "bogus social media accounts" from which "smear campaigns" and "doubtful information and propaganda" were disseminated.
The resultant impact was that Twitter became a battleground of ethnocentric disinformation and political propaganda before, during and in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 elections in Nigeria.

Africa's creative industries get a half-billion-dollar boost by big banks to reap the vast fortunes lying in wait'
Screenshot of Nigerian artist D'banj speaking at CAX Weekend in Cairo, Egypt, 2018.
Dbanj told investors that "content is the next crude oil" and must be respected as much.
In recent years, cultural and creative industries have played a growing role in developing economies, in terms of their economic contribution as well as their power to effect social change and cultural engagement.
In 2013, cultural and creative industries (CCI) generated $2,250 billion United States dollars worth of revenue and 29.5 million jobs worldwide [but] only 3 percent of these jobs came from Africa and the Middle East, according to a 2013 study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) called “Cultural time.”
For this reason, African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) in collaboration with UNESCO and African Development Bank Group, developed the Creative Africa Exchange (CAX) as a "catalyst that brings together the identified assets and resources within the creative industry" to consolidate, monetize and impact African creative and cultural economies, according to the CAX website.
CAX launched during the Intra Africa Trade Fair in Cairo, Egypt, in December 2018.
African creative talents from the fields of music, arts, design, fashion, literature, publishing, film and television came together for a Creative Africa Exchange Weekend in Kigali, Rwanda, January 16-18, 2020.
It advertises itself as the "first continental event dedicated to promoting exchange within the creative and cultural industry in Africa", with over 2,000 participants from 68 countries.
On the second day of the event in Kigali, professor Benedict Oramah, president of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) announced a $500 million USD fund "to support the production and trade of African cultural and creative products" over the next two years, New Times Rwanda reported.
Omarah told guests at the event that the funds, which would build on what the bank was already doing, would be accessible as lines of credit to banks, direct financing to operators and as guarantees.
He said that while Africa had a deep pool of talent, it lacked the infrastructure and capacity to commercialize its creative talent and reap the vast fortunes lying in wait, according to Afreximbank.
He continued:
Because of underinvestment in the creative and cultural industries, Africa is largely absent in the global market of ideas, values and aesthetics as conveyed through music, theater, literature, film and television.
African countries import overwhelmingly more creative goods than they export or trade amongst themselves.
He commended Egypt’s "astronomical growth in creative exports over the last decade".
In December 2019, Afreximbank was honored at the International Fashion Awards (IFA) in Cairo for its role in supporting Africa's creative industry.
Omarah also commended Nigeria's Nollywood industry.
On Twitter, artists who were attendance showed their appreciation for the gathering held at Intare conference center in Kigali:
Speaking at the 2018 CAX Weekend in Cairo, Nigerian artist D'Banj told bankers and investors:
What we need is for you guys to really understand is that content is the new crude oil and however well you respect the oil industry you have to respect the creative industry.
The concluded CAX Weekend 2020 will be followed by CAX Week on the sidelines of the second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2020) from September 1-7, 2020, also in Kigali.
Broadcasters from Nigeria join global celebration of World Radio Day 2020
Radio — the most affordable and portable tool for development

There is no doubt that the radio has had a profound impact on global development.
To honor the importance and unique value of radio, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared February 13 World Radio Day.
UNESCO set aside this day to draw attention to the power of radio — which remains the most affordable and portable medium to reach the widest audience.
Nigerian broadcasters joined radio practitioners around the world to honor the powerful role that radio plays in global development.
"Even though the new media is taking over the world with the way we do things, radio is still the most viable option for many people to get information, it remains the most powerful tool for journalists to reach people in the farthest and remote areas..." said Bishop George Bako, during his opening remarks at the World Radio Day Symposium. Bako is the former Director-General of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN).

FRCN — popularly known as Radio Nigeria — is the foremost broadcast radio station in Nigeria, that serves a teeming population of listeners in the Lagos metropolis on three different stations, namely: Radio One 103.5 FM, Metro 97.7 FM and the multiple award-winning Bond 92.9 FM.
Each station — with its own unique audience and share of the market — broadcasts in English, Nigerian Pidgin, Hausa, Igbo and Yorùbá languages.
Radio remains the greatest means of news dissemination in Nigeria. FM (frequency modulation) is most common, followed closely by AM (amplitude modulation), according to Media Landscape of the European Journalism Centre — and online radio has also become quite popular.
As of 2019, Bond FM holds the number 1 position in Lagos State as the station with the largest audience, according to the Nigeria Diary Radio Stations Ratings of August 2019.
To celebrate, broadcasters from across Nigeria took to Twitter to show some love for radio:
Dan Manjang, the commissioner for information and communication of Plateau state, congratulated broadcasters everywhere for "all the sacrifice, resources and time" put into keeping citizens informed and entertained:
Radio broadcasting in Nigeria started in 1933 with the British colonial government’s Radio Diffusion Service (RDS), whereby loudspeakers were installed in dedicated public places for people to listen to the British Broadcasting Corporation’s foreign radio service broadcasts.
By 1950, the Radio Diffusion Service took on a new name — the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) — and later, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), with broadcast stations in the different regions of the country. NBC later metamorphosed into the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) in 1978.
"The first radio station in Nigeria was established in Ibadan in 1939.
The next station was created in Kano in 1944," according to Legit media online.
RayPower FM, the first private radio station in Nigeria, was established in 1994, and by 2007, the masses could get international transmission broadcast worldwide, according to Legit.
Radio has always served as a tool to check decision-makers, establish and provide access to information and motivate and inspire the people.
In 2019, African Independent Television and RayPower FM were shut down by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for incisive broadcast and propaganda against the government.
Also in 2019, Jay FM in Port Harcourt was shut down for allegedly making broadcasts against the government.
Radio Nigeria truck advertises itself as "the network for the millennium," and joins radio practitioners around the globe in celebrating World Radio Day 2020.

Radio that unites and uplifts
UNESCO implores all nations to celebrate World Radio Day through partnership activities that cut across boundaries by involving all broadcasting associations and organizations, media organizations, government-owned, private and non-governmental organizations.
The theme of the 14th edition of World Radio Day is "Radio and Diversity."
Radio Nigeria is living up to its own motto of uplifting the people and uniting the nation" by disseminating informative, educative and motivating content that empowers Nigerians to be patriotic citizens.
This comes at a time when Nigeria has faced serious divisions over ethnic, political and cultural tensions throughout the country.
The 2019 Fragile States Index ranked Nigeria as the 14th most fragile state in the world and the ninth in Africa.
Since 2011, Boko Haram, the Islamist jihadist militancy in northeast Nigeria, has created a climate of fear and division as their brutal attacks have led to thousands of deaths and millions of displacements.

To further continue to uplift Nigeria, the management of FRCN Lagos Operations put together a series of events to commemorate World Radio Day 2020.
It kicked off with an essay contest calling for 1,200 words on "why I love listening to the radio" for secondary school students.
Students of mass communications also submitted a 5-minute documentary on the importance of radio in achieving sustainable development goals. Two winners emerged from both entries.
Essay winner Ìlọ̀rí Ayọ̀olúwa of Mater Christi Catholic Girls' High School, Igede Èkìtì, Èkìtì State, recalls the first time she encountered radio at the age 5:
I think I was 5 years old when I got my first radio.
I fiddled with a few buttons and it came on.
Then I was astonished to hear voices resonating from this "box" and thought there were people trapped in it.
I got scared and asked my father what it was and he took his time to explain what a radio was to me.
On February 12, secondary school pupils, students of mass communication, ace broadcasters and key personnel from the media industry as well as everyday radio fans converged on the Lekki Coliseum in Lagos for a symposium to talk about the importance of radio for development.

When the sun went down, veteran broadcasters, representatives of the Oba of Lagos, Ọ̀túnba Gani Adams, the Ààrẹ Ọ̀nà Kakanfò of Yorùbá-land and other guests and dignitaries mingled at the Lekki Coliseum for the World Radio Day award ceremony and dinner.
Top broadcast professionals like Cordelia Okpei and a host of others graced the event.
Some deserving persons were presented with awards of recognition for their contributions to the development of the broadcast industry and service to humanity.
The series of events culminated in an on-air phone-in programme, whereby listeners made phone calls to say “happy World Radio Day” in their diverse range of languages and tongues:
No one was left out of the celebration. Voices of some of the Global Voices Lingua teams were also broadcast on Metro 97.7FM. Some retired broadcasters were invited to read the news or anchor a segment.
Radio Nigeria World Radio Day 2020 is the maiden edition of such events but radio practitioners and advocates expect it to become an annual celebration.
This chief hopes Yorùbá speakers adopt his newly invented 'talking alphabet'
Will the new Yorùbá orthography become mainstream in the future?
Chief Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn stands next to the paramount king of Yorùbáland, the Ọọ̀ni of Ifẹ̀, seated.

In the wake of the International Year of Indigenous Languages in 2019 and the International Decade of Indigenous Languages 2022-2032, many Africans have started to take a wide range of actions to advance African languages.
Writing the Yorùbá language in the borrowed Latin script may soon become a thing of the past as one Yorùbá man, Chief Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn, based in Benin, West Africa, has invented a writing system to encode the Yorùbá language.
The newly invented Yorùbá alphabet is making waves in the hopes that it could replace Latin script used for over 100 years.
The distinct alphabet came to him through divine inspiration in his dreams, according to Chief Ògúntósìn in a Whatsapp interview with Global Voices.
He now travels across Yorùbáland — spanning Benin to Nigeria — to promote his "talking alphabet" as sent to him by his ancestors.
Chief Ògúntósìn believes that this alphabet was used by Odùduwà, the father of the Yorùbá people, in ancient times — but was lost.
There are 25 symbols in all.
African linguists assert that if Africa is to grow, it must have its own orthographies or writing systems.
A civilized and ancient Niger-Congo language like Yorùbá should not rely on a borrowed orthography to encode its thoughts and philosophy.
Read more: Yorùbá loan words: How languages evolve
In 1843, Reverend Samuel Àjàyí Crowther of the Christian Missionary Society developed the Yorùbá orthography by adopting Latin script with diacritics — or accent marks.
Ever since, thousands of books have been published in Yorùbá using Latin script instead of Ajami, an Arabic script used before 1843 to write in West African Indigenous languages such as Yorùbá and Hausa.
Some language advocates contend that using Latin, a foreign script, to encode African languages, keeps the continent in an enslaved mindset.
Instilling this new writing system follows a history of ancient writing systems in Africa, like Egyptian hieroglyphics, the Adrinka collection of the Akan tribe of Ghana, Ethiopian Ge'ez, the Nsibidi ideographic script of West Central Africa which date back to 5000 BC, as well as Vai alphabet scripts are of African origin.
Divining a 'talking alphabet'
Global Voices Yorùbá Lingua Manager Ọmọ Yoòbá interviewed Chief Ògúntósìn, via WhatsApp voice note messaging, to learn more about how he discovered this new alphabet.
Chief Ògúntósìn, now 43, explained that after the demise of his father in 1997, he had to care for his siblings as the oldest son and could not further his education after completing secondary school.
However, as a Yorùbá chief, he focused his cultural work on uniting the seven grandchildren of Odùduwa, serving as a mediator.
As his cultural integration work progressed, however, he wanted to achieve more.
In 2011, he approached a babaláwo or “diviner” of Ifa, the Yorùbá god of wisdom.
The diviner, Olókun Awópẹ̀tu, told him to visit his ancestral shrine within the Farasinmi community in Badagry, Lagos State, Nigeria, and to take whatever he came into contact with at the shrine.
There, he found a “strange object” that he took with him back to Porto-Novo, Benin.
When he arrived, the house was completely dark.
With no light bulbs in the living room, he usually relied on light emitted from the rays of the TV screen.
He placed the object on the table and switched on the TV, only to discover, surprisingly, that the object he placed on the table had disappeared.
He turned the entire room upside down and finally found it in a corner of the house.
That night, he slept with the object under his pillow. He told Global Voices:
I had a dream that I visited the sun.
When I got to the sun, it was dark and I was shown the alphabet in the form of lightning.
Every time I slept, I had similar dreams, going from planet to planet, teaching people how to use the script...
For three years, he kept dreaming about the alphabet, seeing visions consecutively, yet he did nothing about it.
This time around, in 2016, I went to the sun again, I met a man, Lámúrúdu, who taught me the sound of the alphabet, he afterward sanctioned me to go all over the globe teaching people the mastery of the symbols.
I usually look old in my dreams — and tired — when I wake up from sleep.
Things started to become scary for Chief Ògúntósìn — he began to feel weak, he told Global Voices.
He decided to narrate his dreams to a close spiritual adviser, Oníkòyí, king of Àjàṣẹ́ in Port-Novo, who counseled him to do what he was instructed in his dreams.
For this reason, he now travels from place to place in Yorùbáland to pass on his knowledge of the Odùduwà alphabet.
The following is a short video of teachers instructing students how to write the Odùduwà alphabet in a Benin classroom:
Promoting theYorùbá alphabet
In 2017, Chief Ògúntósìn, in the company of prominent traditional rulers in Yorùbáland and the diaspora, paid a visit to Rauf Arẹ́gbẹ́ṣọlá, the one-time governor of Nigeria’s Ọ̀ṣun State, in Òṣogbo, the state capital, to solicit support for his newly found Odùduwà alphabet.
Arẹ́gbẹ́ṣọlá now serves as the Minister of the Federal Ministry of Interior of Nigeria.
A reminder letter was sent to the governor of Osun state after promises made to teach the new alphabet have gone unfulfilled.
Three years later, regrettably, verbal promises made by former governor Arẹ́gbẹ́ṣọlá to teach the discovered alphabet in elementary schools across southwest Nigeria have gone unfulfilled.
In a bid to make the Odùduwà alphabet popular, Chief Ògúntósìn has written a book and produced a documentary on the orthography — with snippets uploaded on the internet for public viewing — as well as an abandoned cartoon project which did not see the light of day due to lack of funds.
Chief Ògúntósìn also uses YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook Groups: “Ẹ̀kọ́ Aèébàèjìogbè Odùduwà” and "Odùduwà Alphabets" to promote and teach interested language learners.
He calls on all stakeholders to support the promotion of his linguistic discovery that will checkmate Western writing culture and give the Yorùbá people their deserved identity in terms of language development.
A kind-hearted Yorùbá man, Sunday Adéníyì, supported the cause by printing 1,000 copies of the "Aèébàèjìogbè Odùduwà Alphabets" exercise book for primary school pupils.

Copies of the educational pamphlets were printed in Igbo, Hausa, English, and French languages respectively. However, more support is crucial to disseminate the alphabet to a wider audience.
The Odùduwà alphabet is a welcome development.
Nevertheless, the shift from writing in Latin to the new system will be a major challenge.
That said, the Odùduwà alphabet is a great step in the right direction toward the development and growth of the Yorùbá language — in what Yorùbá people will call their own.
Yorùbá loanwords: How languages evolve
Do you say àkàrà or bean cake?

Relationships between languages have existed for hundreds of years.
Think of the word "restaurant," borrowed from the French language into English.
Today, this loanword — a word adopted from one language into another without translation — circulates in English as if it was never borrowed.
These linguistic borrowings can be attributed to immigration, commerce, and trade as people were exposed to a wide range of ethnolinguistic environments.
Through these interactions, people were exposed to various linguistic contexts, and words and phrases were borrowed to accommodate these encounters.
The Yorùbá case is no exception.
Spoken widely by about 40 million speakers in Nigeria, Yorùbá language has been influenced by the English language spoken by the British, who held colonial power in Nigeria from 1914 to 1960.
More than half of the vocabulary words used in Yorùbá are borrowed from English. Think of the word "cup", it was domesticated as kó̩ò̩pù.
The word "phone" is fóònù, "ball" is bó̩ò̩lù, and "television" is te̩lifís̩ó̩ò̩nù, among others.
These English words that were "loaned" to Yorùbá expanded its vocabulary over time.
There are also instances of the Yorùbá language borrowing words from the Hausa language, spoken by 44 million people in the northern part of Nigeria.
This language borrows heavily from Arabic, as well, with words like àlùbáríkà ("blessing"), àlùbó̩sà ("onion") and wàhálà ("trouble").
The beauty of Yorùbá loanwords is that speakers now use them in their day-to-day conversations as they get absorbed into the language.
It is not uncommon to hear people say, Bá o̩mo̩ ye̩n mú bó̩ò̩lu è̩ or "Help the child take the ball" in English.
Although the underlined word bó̩ò̩lu is not native to the Yorùbá language, speakers manage to make it fit.
One of the challenges with the Yorùbá language with regard to loanwords is that native speakers themselves love translating Yorùbá words into English and using them in sentences instead of the original Yorùbá word.
An example is the word àkàrà — most Yorùbá speakers translate it to bean cake in daily interactions —, especially with foreigners.
Using words in their original forms helps ensure that culture — kept alive through language — continues to thrive.
For instance, no one calls Japan’s sushi by any other name — sushi is sushi.
If this was the case for many Yorùbá words, too, its language and culture could flourish beyond Nigeria and the Yorùbá-speaking world.
For example, àmàlà is a famous Yorùbá food, even in the diaspora.
This word could easily find its way into the lexicon of other languages if Yorùbá speakers insisted on it.
Translating it to "yam flour" lessens its status and linguistic root — its "Yorubaness."
Think of the anglicized Yorùbá word "fanimorious", which is becoming more popular and appears in the Urban Dictionary.
It means "appealing", or "beautiful", and comes from the word fanimó̩ra in Yorùbá.
This could be phono-morphological: Yorùbá language does not allow final word consonants and consonant clusters.
As a result, the English suffix -ious was added to the Yorùbá root word.
However, the fact remains that the word stems from the Yorùbá language. This is a win for the Yorùbá.
Recently, several other Nigerian English words were added to the Oxford English Dictionary.
Yorùbá will make giant strides only if its speakers contribute to its growth; Its usage in the media is also important as the world becomes increasingly more digitized.
Consequently, this will spur further research on the Niger-Congo language.
Lost in translation: Why Google Translate often gets Yorùbá — and other languages — wrong
Most translations done by machines render some words wrong
Wikimedia User Group Nigeria, October 2018 via Wikimedia Commons CC.BY.2.0.
The English language has dominated online discourse as the "universal" language of communication since the inception of the internet.
As of February 2020, over half of the websites on the internet are in English, according to WebTech3.
But as more people get online who speak different languages, it has sparked a linguistic digital revolution — immediate access to English translations of multiple languages with the click of a button.
Many tech companies have recently put effort into documenting non-English words on the internet, paving the way for the digitization of multiple languages. Google, Yoruba Names, Masakhane MT and ALC are examples of companies and start-ups that have been trying to marry technology with non-English languages.
In late February 2020, Google announced that it would add five new languages to its Google Translate services, including Kinyarwanda, Uighur, Tatar, Turkmen and Odia, after a four-year hiatus on adding new languages.

But have you ever clicked on the translation option and realized that the English translation is, at best, just OK?
And at worst, not accurate at all?
There are many controversies and difficulties when it comes to doing this kind of language translation and access work.
Twitter offers Yorùbá language translation into English via Google Translate as much as possible, and usually, the outcome isn’t totally bad — perhaps a few words are correct.
The reason for these challenges is that tech companies usually collect their linguistic data for English translation sourced from the internet.
This data may work for some languages, but languages like Yorùbá and Ìgbò, two main languages from Nigeria, are challenging, due to the inadequate or inaccurate accent marks to indicate tones on these words.
In response to why it has taken Google four years to add five new languages, a company spokesperson explained:
Google Translate learns from existing translations found on the web, and when languages don’t have an abundance of web content, it’s been difficult for our system to support them effectively.
However, due to recent advances in our machine learning technology, and active involvement from our Google Translate Community members, we’ve been able to add support for these languages.
Also, most people are not so good with the orthographies — or spellings — in these languages.
As a result, good translations don’t compute because these errors are not flagged as inadequate.
Most translations done by machines render some words wrong, especially words that are culturally nuanced.
For example, Yorùbá words ayaba and obabìnrin have their meanings situated in a cultural context.
Most machines translate both words as "queen".
However, from a traditional-cum-cultural vantage point, it is essential to note that the meanings of ayaba and obabìnrin are different: Ọbabìnrin means "queen" in English while ayaba is "wife of the king".
Even with these translation complications, technology has helped with the advancement of African languages in digital spaces, spurring the coinage of new words.
African languages have grown with the influx of new gadgets like smartphones and tablets, as new words are coined to name these new technological tools and concepts.
This process has thus expanded the usage and functionality of these languages.
With the emergence of new technologies, the vocabularies of many African languages have become more sophisticated.
For instance, the Yorùbá language has some tech-influenced words such as erọ amúlétutù ("air conditioner"), erọ Ìbánisọ̀rọ̀ ("phone") and erọ Ìlọta ("grinder").
Similarly, the Igbo language has words such as ekwè nti ("telephone") and ugbọ̀ àlà ("vehicle").
These societies have given these gadgets names based on the functions they perform.
In courses on broadcasting and advertisement in Yorùbá, students learn that most people call TV erọ Amóhùnmáwòrán.
This coinage generates many questions and opinions — some students argue that video cameras and recorders can also be called erọ amóhùnmáwòrán based on their functionalities.
These linguistic challenges in the tech space are healthy for languages — it stimulates critical thinking for both linguistic and tech advancement.
In 2019, Google opened its first AI research center in Accra, Ghana, focused on improving “Google Translate's ability to capture African languages more precisely,” according to CNN.
Research scientist Moustapha Cisse, who heads Google's AI work in Africa, believes that "a continent with more than 2,000 dialects deserves to be better served," as reported by CNN.
Mozilla and BMZ recently announced their cooperation to open up voice technology for African languages. With initiatives like this, there is more to show in the future with regards to studies in African languages.
Churches in Greece and North Macedonia refuse to modify rituals conducive to the spread of COVID-19
"Institution of the Eucharist", a 1442 painting by Fra Angelico. Public Domain photo via Wikipedia.
While the number of people with COVID-19 steadily increases in the Balkans, a few Christian churches have refused to change liturgical practices that can contribute to the spread of the coronavirus.
The ritual known as the Holy Communion or Eucharist has Orthodox Christian worshipers drinking consecrated wine by a shared spoon, while Catholics eat thin slices of bread directly from the hand of the priest.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends avoiding large gatherings and increased levels of personal hygiene and sanitation in order to minimize the spread of the virus by touch, exchange of bodily fluids, and through the air.
In an official statement dated March 9, the Greek Orthodox Church said it will not be modifying the ritual to comply with safety measures.
It also added that the "coronavirus is not transmitted via Holy Communion, and the faithful should pray against the spread of the deadly virus".
GOC bishop Klimis, the Metropolitan of Peristeri, a suburban municipality near Athens, said that those who believe the virus could spread via religious rituals are blasphemers:
The Holy Communion is life.
It is a miracle.
It is a blasphemy to believe that the virus can be transmitted by receiving Holy Communion.
There have been 89 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Greece, with no deaths so far.
Greek authorities, who have recently closed schools and prohibited gatherings in efforts to prevent transmission, urged the Church to reconsider.
But state officials themselves seem to be ignoring those concerns. On a major religious holiday last Sunday, the president and some government ministers attended a public mass.
In neighboring North Macedonia, the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric seems to be following a similar path.
Although the church has not yet issued any official statement about the outbreak, it has continued to conduct the Holy Communion normally.
Alarms were raised when the official website of the Prespa-Pelagonia Diocese published a translated article by Russian website Pravoslavie.ru (meaning "Orthodox Christianity") claiming it's "impossible for believers to be infected during church rituals".
The text is signed by Russian priest Sergey Adonin, who claims to have knowledge of microbiology and experience working in hospitals.
He stressed in the article that the rule of using the same spoon instituted in the 7th century Bizantium has so far done no harm, because "faith in God protects both the parishioners and the priests".
Also in North Macedonia, right-wing propagandists expressed support to the church.
For instance, one conservative TV host — who in the past promoted anti-vax activists — boasted on Twitter to have participated in risky religious rituals:
Tweet: I received Holy Communion last Sunday in the Church of Holy Annunciation which is part of the Clinical Center in Skopje and will do it again!
What's your problem?
Link title: In spite of the appeal by health authorities: Believers received Holy Communion without fear from the coronavirus.
Sladjana Velkov, an anti-vax celebrity operating in Serbia and North Macedonia, recently declared that the situation is "not serious" and that the new virus is "just a common cold which, like the other common colds, affects only older people or people with compromised immunity".
Meanwhile from Italy, where over 631 people have died from the infection and more than 10,000 are affected, this user tweeted:
So far there have been seven confirmed cases of COVID-19 in North Macedonia; 25 in Slovenia; 13 in Croatia; six in Albania; five in Serbia; five in Bosnia; and zero in Montenegro.
There have been 28 cases in Romania and six in Bulgaria.
Christians elsewhere
The world has already witnessed how the novel coronavirus can spread through religious congregations.
Last month, a majority of 7,400 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea — a country that until then seemed to have the outbreak under control — were traced to the group Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Criminal charges were filed against the sect — often called a cult — and its 88-year-old leader publicly apologized.
Meanwhile, the Orthodox Diocese of Korea announced changes in its liturgical practices in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health:
1. During the Divine Liturgy all believers will wear masks.
2. Before entering the Church, they will disinfect their hands with a disinfectant present at the entrance of the Church.
3. They will not shake hands with anyone.
4. They will not kiss the hand of the Clergy.
5. They will not kiss the Icons, but they will bow before them.
6. They will not use the liturgical books at the time of prayer.
7. They will not receive the Antidoron from the Clergy, but on their own as they leave the church.
8. The Agape Meal will not be served following the Sunday Liturgy.
9. The various group meetings of the Faithful as well as the Catechumens will not take place.
Some churches in Europe have adopted similar measures, such as the Catholic church in Italy.
The diocese in Croatia have also enacted restrictive rules and, in France, a pilgrimage site in the city of Lourdes has been shut down.
The Orthodox Church of Romania issued a decree announcing "exceptional measures taken only because of the threat of an epidemic":
Believers who are afraid of virus transmission may temporarily refrain from kissing the holy icons in the churches.
They can exceptionally ask the priest to use their own spoon for the Holy Communion.
After Italy enacted a complete lockdown on national territory, other European states, like the Czech Republic also took more drastic measures on March 10, such as the closure of schools.
The Government of North Macedonia declared a state of emergency and also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities for two weeks.

Nigeria enforces travel bans amid sloppy management of COVID-19 cases
Travel ban on 13 countries with over 1,000 cases of COVID-19

Check out Global Voices’ special coverage of the global impact of COVID-19.
Nigeria has confirmed five new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of coronavirus patients to eight, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
The increase to eight patients came just 48 hours after Dr. E. Osagie Ehanire confirmed the third case of COVID-19, March 16, as a "Nigerian national in her 30s who returned from a short visit to the United Kingdom on March 13":
The patient voluntarily began a 14-day self-isolation in Lagos, during which she developed symptoms of fever and cough.
The patient is currently admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos.
She is clinically stable and responding to treatment.
As numbers of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Nigeria, the government has yielded to public outcry on March 18 by placing travel restrictions on citizens from 13 countries with over 1,000 domestic cases of coronavirus: China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Switzerland.
Those who have already entered the country from these countries must go through a 14-day quarantine.
On February 27, an Italian national visiting Nigeria was confirmed as the index case for COVID-19 in the country.

The second confirmed case, according to the NCDC, is a contact of the index case who has now tested negative twice.
Consequently, the second case was cleared of the virus and was discharged to go home on 13th of March 2020, states the NCDC.
Many Nigerian netizens have not been satisfied with the current response to COVID-19 and have called for tougher measures to prevent the spread of the pandemic in Nigeria.
Netizen Ayobami decried the slow response of the NCDC. He advised the agency to "stop the media parade and do some work!"
Gideon says it "should scare all of us" that COVID-19 testing is slow in Nigeria.
"Restrict travelers coming in especially from countries" affected by this virus, insists journalist Bayo Olupohunda:
Dr. Whitewalker insists that a travel ban is a normal epidemiological intervention in order to stem the tide of transmission during a pandemic like this:
Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, head of NCDC, pleaded that they are "trying VERY hard to meet all urgent needs":
On March 17, the Senate, Nigeria's upper legislative house, initially called for a ban on flights from coronavirus high-risk countries like the United Kingdom and China, before extending the restrictions the following day.
All visitors from affected countries will undergo a "supervised self-isolation and testing for 14 days," reports the Cable Nigeria.
The government also temporarily suspended visas-on-arrival in Nigeria.
The travel ban comes into effect on Saturday, March 21, 2020, and will last four weeks, which is open to a possible extension upon review.

Several African countries have been implementing tough protocols to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
These stringent measures include placing travel restrictions on nations with high numbers of COVID-19 cases.
Sloppy management
There are reports about the inadequate and slipshod response by health officials to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.
A 70-year-old woman who had spent five months in the United Kingdom returned to Nigeria, on March 11.
Soon after, she presented with COVID-19 symptoms like cold and excessive mucous and on March 13, she was rushed to Enugu State Teaching Hospital (ESUTH) Colliery Parklane, in southeast Nigeria.
She was isolated in ESUTH Colliery Parklane while her samples were sent to NCDC for diagnosis on March 14.
On March 15, the woman died after the NCDC had reported that she tested negative to COVID-19.
However, in a letter written to Enugu's state governor, the woman's daughter alleged that her mother was "stigmatized" by the hospital staff who placed her in a “dilapidated” isolation centre overgrown with “grass and debris”.
Another ill-managed COVID-19 case presented in Lagos, the commercial capital of Nigeria.
On March 17, David Hundeyin, a journalist with News Wire, reported the poor handling of a suspected COVID-19 case at Dangote Oil Refinery Company in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, which has precipitated panic among workers.
On March 12, an Indian pipefitter from Dangote Refinery flew into Nigeria from Mumbai, after a brief stopover in Cairo, Egypt.
Hudeyin's investigation revealed that the pipefitter developed "a fever, a dry cough, a sore throat and significant breathing difficulty," a day after his return from India.
Yet, “it is unclear whether anyone at Dangote Refinery attempted to establish contact” with appropriate health officials.
Hudeyin further lamented that the firm took advantage of "the lax regulatory environment" in Nigeria "to put its own interests first", which puts the life of staff as well as the general public at risk.
This report forced refinery management to release a report stating that the said patient has been moved to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba, Lagos.
How is COVID-19 reshaping the political and global future of China?

What started at a seafood market as a local health issue has grown into a national health crisis in China.
After the Wuhan coronavirus was identified in December 2019, a chain reaction was set in motion that has profoundly shaken Chinese society and challenged Beijing’s political stability.
Gripped by its obsession with information control, the Chinese government, both local and central, delayed the release of life-saving information for weeks.
When they suddenly announced drastic measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic in late January, for many it was much too late as the Chinese New Year kick-off celebrations had already begun.
Doctors and scientists are still researching and debating the possible origin of the previously unknown Wuhan coronavirus, which causes COVID-2019, a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and can lead to pneumonia.
One possible theory is that it comes from snakes or bats that are consumed as a delicacy in China and were sold at the Huanan wet market in Wuhan where the virus is believed to originate.
One of the key questions determining the spread of the virus is its transmissibility: whether it can jump from human to human, and how many people can be infected on average by the same virus carrier.
The latest medical evidence indicates there is human-to-human transmission, and what is concerning is that it seems to happen before the virus carrier develops symptoms, thus making detection incredibly challenging.
As for the rate of transmission, called “basic reproduction number” by epidemiologists, it is believed to be between 2 to 3 in late January, meaning one person infects two to three persons, but the numbers are still being discussed and require further research should proper data be made available.
As the figure of infected people rises daily, a major health crisis has developed in China’s central province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan that have a combined population of nearly 60 million people.
As cases have been confirmed all over China, all medical staff are on alert, adding pressure on a medical system that is often insufficient for such a large and aging population.
But the Wuhan coronavirus is not just a health crisis, it is also a major political moment of truth.
Trust in the government that claimed there was nothing to worry about until very late in the game has eroded public confidence significantly, and not just in Hubei province.
Beijing was criticized for the way it mishandled the SARS crisis in 2002-2003 as it concealed information from the World Health Organization (WHO).
China’s top leader Xi Jinping kept silent on the recent outbreak until January 20 when he recognized the severity of the situation in a public statement – over one month after the first cases had been identified.
Control of information remains tight, and as China is experiencing a trade war with the US and an economic slowdown, the handling of the Wuhan coronavirus crisis will determine the course of Chinese society and politics in 2020.
Mozambique and Cape Verde's telcos offer affordable mobile internet as citizens urged to stay home

Check out Global Voices’ special coverage of the global impact of COVID-19.
As more and more Africans are ordered to stay at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Mozambique and Cape Verde state-owned telcos are offering significant discounts on mobile data.
To date, Mozambique has registered a total of 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths, while Cape Verde has had six cases and one death.
Last week, both countries have imposed a 30-day state of emergency, with the possibility of extension.
According to Portugal's news agency Lusa:
Translation Original Quote
The two Cape Verdean mobile telecommunications operators, CV Móvel and Unitel T+, announced today a joint campaign that will make available a free package of 2,000 MB of internet to encourage citizens to stay at home, as a form of prevention of COVID-19.
Titled the “Fica em Casa” (“stay home” in English) package, the promotion was announced by the two operators on social networks in a message that says they have “joined forces” so that Cape Verdeans stay “well at home”.
The package offers customers of both operators, in addition to the 2,000 MB data package, 15 minutes of calls for all national operators to be used up until April 30.
COVID-19: Campaign gives 2000 MB of internet to help Cape Verdeans to stay home.
A few people have questioned the efficacy of such campaign as many Cape Verdeans don't have regular internet access:
What a joke !!!
How many Cape Verdeans have internet?
In Cape Verde, an island country of 560,000 people, 57 percent of the population use the internet, according to 2017 data by the World Bank.
On that year, the world average was 50 percent.
In Mozambique, where internet penetration is even lower — the same World Bank report says only 10 percent of its 30 million people are internet users –, state-owned operator TmCel launched a similar promotion, with the same "stay home" slogan.
The promotion consists of packages ranging from 1 to 5 GB, costing from 25 to 100 meticals (0.37 to 1.50 USD).
Activate the #StayAtHome offers from 25 meticals valid for 30 days.
Use *219# choose your offer and stay at home with Tmcel. For more information visit the link below:
Although the offer seems to have been well received, a few Twitter users posed questions:
Good initiative.
Is the quality good too?
Staying home is not an option for the many informal and daily subsistence workers in Mozambique and Cape Verde. Activist Tomás Queface tweeted:
The #Coronavirus reveals yet another facet of social inequalities.
While #StayAtHome is a privilege for few people, for the poor it is a constant dilemma: staying at home without food, or continuing to work and risk your health or endangering the health of others.
COVID-19 revives grim history of medical experimentation in Africa
Africa isn't a testing lab'

Check out Global Voices’ special coverage of the global impact of COVID-19.
The mad rush by scientists and researchers to test potential treatments for COVID-19 in scientific trials has revived a heated debate over the use of humans in critical drug trials in Africa.
On April 1, two French researchers, Dr. Jean-Paul Mira and Camille Locht, suggested on a live television broadcast that trials of a potential vaccine should first take place in Africa, according to Al Jazeera.
Dr. Mira, head of the intensive care unit at Cochin Hospital in Paris, compared the current situation to “certain AIDS studies, where among prostitutes, we try things because we know that they are highly exposed and don't protect themselves.”
The two researchers made these comments in the context of a discussion of trials in Europe and Australia to see if the BCG tuberculosis vaccine could be effective against the novel coronavirus.
In Australia, trials are being conducted on at least 4,000 health care workers.
The attitude of these researchers echoes a long, grim history of medical experimentation and exploitation in Africa, where African leaders have colluded with pharmaceutical companies — often based in Europe or the United States — to conduct trials on the most vulnerable people in society.
The researchers’ remarks immediately sparked condemnation and outrage, with the trending hashtag phrase, "Africans are not guinea pigs."
Ivorian football star Didier Drogba tweeted:
By April 3, Dr. Mira had apologized for his comments, but only after major pushback and pressure from the France-based anti-racism group SOS Racisme. Dr. Locht’s employer, however, dismissed the outrage on Twitter as "fake news", saying that the remarks had been taken out of context.
That same week, Congolese virologist Jean-Jacque Muyembe, who worked on the frontlines of the Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo, announced that DR Congo "is prepared to take part in testing of any future vaccine against the coronavirus", according to News 24.
Muyembe, the head of the nation’s pandemic task force and national health institute, told a news conference:
We've been chosen to conduct these tests...
The vaccine will be produced in the United States, or in Canada, or in China.
We're candidates for doing the testing here.
Once again, the remarks drew ire from Congolese citizens and netizens around the world condemning Dr. Muyembe’s openness to hosting clinical trials in DR Congo, where the rates of infection for COVID-19 are still relatively low.
Within hours, Dr. Muyembe clarified his statements in a video message, confirming that the vaccine would only be trialed in DR Congo after it had been done in countries such as the US and China:
A grim history of medical experiment in Africa
Medical experimentation in Africa — often conducted under the guise of the "greater good" and of finding cures for deadly diseases like meningitis and HIV/AIDS — has sounded ethical and moral alarm bells for years — particularly over informed consent and forced medical procedures.
These trials are often funded by leading health organizations like the World Health Organization, the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Health.
In Zimbabwe, in the 1990s, over 17,000 HIV-positive women were tested without informed consent in trials for the anti-retroviral drug AZT funded by the CDC, WHO and the NIH.
In the 1990s, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer tested an experimental drug called Trovan on 200 children in Kano, Nigeria, during an epidemic of bacterial meningitis.
Several families filed and won a lawsuit against Pfizer on the basis of violation of informed consent.
Medical experimentation is not only entrenched in the history of racism and colonialism — it also sets a dangerous precedent by eroding the critical trust between citizens and health authorities.
"Both European colonialism and biomedicine reciprocally extended and strengthened the reach of the other," writes Patrick Malloy in an academic paper entitled, "Research Material and Necromancy: Imagining the Political-Economy of Biomedicine in Colonial Tanganyika."
From malaria to other "plague-like" conditions, colonial authorities often subjected African subjects to the non-consensual practice of specimen-sample collection and "...African blood was appropriated to feed colonial-era medical research", Malloy writes.
He continues:
In Tanganyika as well as other African colonies, this meant that colonial subjects could be called upon to surrender tissue samples, literally portions of themselves, to the medical authorities.
These practices overlapped with horrifying rumors in East Africa about “gangs” of people employed by Europeans who would kidnap Africans to withdraw their blood to make a gum-like medicine known as mumiani.
The Swahili term invokes the image of the "vampire" or "bloodletter" — which has also become synonymous with “exploitation.”
This grim history has sown seeds of deep mistrust in vaccinations, medical trials and experiments in Africa, and continues to haunt decisions made by health authorities working in sync with government officials and global pharmaceutical companies.
That 1990s meningitis trial debacle in Kano, Nigeria, sowed so much distrust that it later made it very difficult to promote critical polio testing. Anti-polio vaccine rumors flourished.
Those rumors got disseminated as news and eventually translated into a regional policy banning the polio vaccine in Nigeria in 2003.
Recovering from colonial hangovers
So, what does this all mean for potential COVID-19 trials in Africa?
Netizens and activists have resoundingly expressed the view that “Africans are not guinea pigs.”
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has labeled the attitude of the two French doctors a "hangover" from a "colonial mentality" and declared:
Africa can't and won't be a testing ground for any vaccine.
However, deep-seated fear and distrust of medical experimentation has also turned contact tracing and testing to stem the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus into an uphill battle for health care workers.
In Côte d'Ivoire on April 6, protesters burned down a COVID-19 testing center, claiming its location in a crowded area was not appropriate.
The attack was "reminiscent of attitudes during Ebola outbreaks in West and Central Africa when some people attacked health workers, suspicious that they were bringing the disease to their communities, rather than offering crucial medical care", BBC reported.
Yet, in the throes of the 2018 Ebola outbreak in DR Congo, critical human trials administered to Ebola patients "under an ethical framework" — under the medical guidance of Dr. Muyembe and the government of DR Congo — ultimately saved lives.
By November 2019, a vaccine had been approved after thousands of Congolese with Ebola were tested.
WHO was expected to declare the DR Congo Ebola-free on April 12, but after more than 50 days without a single case, a 26-year-old man contracted Ebola and died on April 10.
Now, in addition to Ebola and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, DR Congo must turn its attention to mitigating the spread of the coronavirus.
There are currently 62 efforts underway to find a vaccine for COVID-19. Responsible, ethical vaccine trials take time and attention.
Will big pharmaceutical companies maintain the same ethical standards in Africa that they usually adhere to in trials conducted in the West?
In Burundi, four journalists jailed for months await appeal
The journalists were accused of threatening state security
The Press House in Bujumbura, from which independent radios were blocked access. 19 May 2010.
Four journalists — Agnès Ndirubusa, Christine Kamikazi, Térence Mpozenzi and Egide Harerimana — were charged with attempting to undermine state security and were sentenced in January 2020.
The four, who all work with Iwacu newspaper, adamantly reject the charges.
They now await an appeal decision on their prison sentence, after their hearing on May 6.
Antoine Kaburahe, Iwacu founder who now lives in exile, wrote:
Breaking: End of court hearing in Bubanza. Iwacu’s defence is satisfied.
The accusations against the journalists do not hold up.
The journalists were only doing their job: reporting.
What a relief!
The case is under consideration, verdict in max 30 days.
Stay strong!
Detained for reporting
On October 22, Burundian security forces battled with an armed anti-government group — reportedly RED-Tabara, based in the Democratic Republic of Congo — around the Kibira forest border area.
Armed groups have often used this area to move through the region.
In the battle, 14 insurgents were said to be killed, while security forces suffered about 10 casualties.
Later that day, police detained the four Iwacu journalists and their driver, Adolphe Masabarakiza, when they went to report at the Musigati commune, Bubanza province, to speak to people who had fled the fighting.
At first, they were detained without charge, and Christine Kamikazi was reportedly hit when arrested.
Police confiscated their phones and materials and the intelligence services demanded account passwords in order to search their phones.
The journalists were then transferred to other cells with deplorable conditions.
On October 26, in Bubanza province, they were finally charged with "complicity in threatening state security".
On October 31, the public prosecutor confirmed this and accused them of having information on the insurgents’ attack.
Various organizations promptly called for their release, including Human Rights Watch, International Federation of Journalists, Olucome, African Journalists’ Federation and the Association Burundaise des Radiodiffuseurs.
However, the National Communications Council said at the time that it could not discuss the matter.
Iwacu criticized this reaction, recalling that they were first held without charge and that the council is supposed to support journalists.
Many people expressed support online and signed a petition. International media discussed it as a threat to press freedom, while Iwacu continues to follow the situation closely.
Journalist Esdras Ndikumana tweeted:
Burundi: 4 Iwacu journalists (and their driver) accused of "complicity in threatening the interior security of the state" for having covered a rebel incursion in Bubanza languish in the this province’s prisons (Drawing by Yaga)
After appealing the decision on their detention, the date for their court hearing was set for November 18, To their surprise, they were summoned on November 11, to appear before judges for questioning — but without lawyers.
They refused to answer without legal assistance, asking why their lawyers had not been informed beforehand, and then returned to detention, to be heard on November 18.
On November 20, the decision came that the four journalists would remain in detention, but the driver was provisionally released.
The prosecution originally called for a 15-year prison sentence.
President Pierre Nkurunziza said during a press conference on December 26 that he wanted a fair trial but he could only intervene as a last resort, even though he could use his power to grant a presidential pardon.
On January 30, in Bubanza, the four journalists were sentenced to two and a half years in prison and a fine of a million francs each ($521 United States dollars) under article 16 of the Penal Code, while the driver was acquitted.
The prosecution could not prove any actual link or contact with the rebels, so the charge was changed to "impossible attempt at the complicity in undermining state security", that is — that they intended to threaten state security but it was not possible.
Iwacu pointed out that the reporters went to the area after authorities had publicly mentioned the incident, were accredited, and there were no restrictions on the area.
The key element used as evidence against the journalists was a WhatsApp message sent by one of the reporters to a friend, which said they were going to "help the rebels".
They argued it was clearly a dry joke — the government has often conflated critics, political opponents, and armed groups to justify generalized crackdowns. But the text was taken literally as evidence against them.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said the journalists should be able to report on sensitive topics without fear of reprisals, particularly ahead of Burundi's May 20 election.
They made a petition calling for their release, which had almost 7,000 signatures in early May.
European Union deputies, the European Parliament, and UN human rights experts are among those who called for their release.
On February 20, the journalists appealed, questioning the quality of the legal process, including the change to the original charge without proper notification.
On May 6, the journalists appeared at an appeal hearing, after approximately six months in jail.
Responding to the accusation based on the WhatsApp message, the defense noted that in another message, one journalist said the rebels were coming to "threaten the peace".
RFI quoted their defense lawyer, Clément Retirakiza, saying there was an absence of evidence against them, and they wanted to show it was a purely professional trip.
Iwacu has long been an independent voice that criticizes politicized violence — it is one of the last independent media outlets following the 2015 crackdown.
A history of violence against journalists
After controversial 2015 elections — in which Nkurunziza returned for a third term that many argued as unconstitutional — there was a failed putsch. The media environment quickly deteriorated.
Several radios stations — the most relied upon for information in Burundi — were closed and some were attacked. Dozens of journalists fled and some suffered torture, such as Esdras Ndikumana.
Numerous journalists have also experienced violence from security forces, particularly when reporting on topics deemed “sensitive” by the state.
In late 2015, cameraman Christophe Nkezabahizi was killed by police along with three family members, in an operation against protests after the contentious election.
In July 2016, Jean Bigirimana was forcibly disappeared, reportedly arrested by intelligence services (SNR), with a limited police investigation.
This year, on January 16, reporter Blaise-Pascal Kararumiye with Radio Isanganiro (Meeting Point Radio) was arrested following a report on local government finances. On April 28, journalist Jackson Bahati was hit by a police officer while reporting.
International media have not been spared, with BBC and VOA banned in 2019. RSF ranked Burundi 160 of 180 countries for press freedom — down 15 from 2015.
Women in Nigeria face a caustic landmine of political advocacy online
#BringBackOurGirls and #ArewaMeToo reshaped political activism in Nigeria

In Nigeria, the political advocacy sphere is a caustic landmine.
Politics and advocacy usually get filtered through a religious and ethnocentric prism.
Advocates with a strong social media presence — especially on Twitter — have to develop a tough skin to deal with the avalanche of gbas gbos (Nigerian Pidgin for “throwing punches”) in digital spaces.
Nigerian female advocates — in addition to weathering this identity-driven harmful content — also face the added reality of gender-driven attacks.
How do female advocates in Nigeria cope with the bitter online terrain such as trolling, hate speech and targeted misalignment of their messages?
How do they forge ahead to make sure that these attacks do not simmer their resolve or eclipse the message of their movement?
Two online social media movements in Nigeria lend powerful insights into the experiences of advocacy and gender: The #BringBackOurGirls movement, led by Dr. Oby Ezekwesili; and #ArewaMeToo, led by Fakhriyyah Hashim, both experienced gendered political hatred that greatly affected the integrity of their messages.
#BringBackOurGirls (#BBOG) movement
Six years ago, on April 15, 2014, about 200 school girls between the ages of 15 and 18, were forcefully abducted by Boko Haram, an Islamist terrorist group, from Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok near Maiduguri, in northeast Nigeria.
The kidnapping of the Chibok girls ignited an international outcry.
The BBC reported that in April 2014, the #BringBackOurGirls trended on Twitter with over 3.3 million tweets, 27 percent of the tweets came from Nigeria, 26 percent from the United States and 11 percent from the United Kingdom.

Dr. Obiageli (Oby) Ezekwesili, a former vice president of the World Bank, and one-time minister of education in Nigeria, started tweeting about the Chibok girls the day they were kidnapped.
She was motivated to take action due to a previous attack on schoolboys at the Federal Government College of Buni Yadi in Yobe State, northeastern Nigeria on February 25, 2014.
Fifty-nine boys died from gunshots or knife wounds, while the others were burnt to death.
However, it was not until April 23, when, as a guest at a UNESCO event in Port Harcourt, in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, did her cry for the release of the schoolgirls grab national and international attention:
And on May 7, 2014, former American first lady Michelle Obama posted an image of herself on Twitter holding a sign with the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.
She also released a video a few days later from the White House — making it a global sensation.
It would take two years before the Nigerian army rescued one girl, in May 2016.
By October 2016, 21 girls were reunited with their families. And by May 2017, Boko Haram militants released 82 girls from captivity.
However, about 112 girls remain missing and 13 are presumed dead, according to a 2018 report.
Ezekwesili co-founded the #BBOG movement that mobilized a global protest for the release of the Chibok girls.
The movement later transformed into a formidable social movement organisation that has withstood the harsh Nigerian civic space.
But the success of this movement occurred at great personal cost to Ezekwesili.
The kidnapping of the Chibok girls occurred on the threshold of the 2015 presidential election, and Ezekwesili's online advocacy was viewed through the prism of partisan politics by some.
Her personal integrity was not only questioned but shredded.
Some alleged that her #BBOG was merely a front to gain political capital.
Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, accused Ezekwesili of being used by the then-opposition party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), to "undermine" the government of President Jonathan, thereby paving the way for APC’s "rise to power".
Supporters of former President Jonathan and the Peoples’ Democratic Party spread "all manners of falsehoods" online against Ezekwesili in 2014: "I was actually being insulted, maligned..." said Ezekwesili in a live Twitter video broadcast on April 14, to mark the sixth anniversary of the abduction.
Ezekwesili was falsely accused of being bitter for not gaining a ministerial appointment under Jonathan.
According to her, some of her online attackers thought “that the reason we kept on with the advocacy of Chibok girls was that I wanted to be made a minister.”
How could I want to be made a minister when I rejected the request to be a minister way before the Chibok girls were abducted three years later?
Ezekwesili said in the live Twitter video broadcast.
She became a 2018 presidential contender, but later withdrew from the race.
Live on Twitter, Ezekwesili recalled her grief: It was a very sad thing for me to bear the thought that children who went to school were so killed and brutally murdered to the point where parents could not recognise their children.
But her grief and rage was eclipsed by the political maligning she endured to get the #BBOG message out.
#ArewaMeToo and NorthNormal
On February 3, 2019, a young woman named Khadijah Adamua found the courage to tweet about the physical abuse inflicted by her ex-boyfriend.
Adamua, who lives in Kano state in northwest Nigeria, had previously blogged about her horrific experiences.
Fellow Nigerian Fakhriyyah Hashim tweeted her support for Adamua with the hashtag #ArewaMeToo:
#ArewaMeToo became northern Nigeria’s version of the global #MeToo movement. (Arewa is the Hausa word for “North”) — igniting a storm of online discussion on rape and other forms of gender-based violence.
Violence against women is rampant throughout Nigeria. However, Relief Web asserts that between November 2014 and January 2015, northeastern Nigeria, especially Borno State, recorded the most violence against women.
In the Muslim-majority north, discussions about these taboo topics are difficult, often forcing victims into silence.
The online rage of #ArewaMeToo propelled the NorthNormal offline protests in Bauchi, Kano, Niger.
Sixteen days of NorthNormal protests occurred in November last year across eight northern Nigerian states and Abuja.
They were largely positive and state legislators "were receptive of young indigenes” for taking “the baton to push for the VAPP", Hashim said.
However, in Sokoto State, "government played a role in harassing and arresting NorthNormal campaigners", Hashim said.
The police manhandled a local leader of the movement.
Thereafter, protests were banned by the Sultan of Sokoto, head of Nigerian Muslims.
According to Hashim, NorthNormal grew out of the #ArewaMeToo hashtag, and has two objectives: advocating for “the domestication of the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP),” and championing the conversation on “various forms of gender-based violence and rape culture across northern Nigeria.”
The Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 was signed into law on May 23, 2015.
Under the VAPP Act — an improvement on the provisions of Nigeria’s penal code — acts of violence against women are punishable offences.
This includes rape, spousal battery, forceful home ejections, forced financial dependence or economic abuse, harmful widowhood practices, female circumcision or genital mutilation, and/or child abandonment.
In Nigeria, rape is punishable with life imprisonment. A minor can face up to 14 years in prison.
In cases of gang rape, offenders are jointly liable to 20 years imprisonment without the option of a fine.
However, Section 47 of the VAPP Act stipulates that this legislation applies only in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. NorthNormal and other organisations have been campaigning for all 36 state legislative assemblies to domesticate this act.
Backlash against advocates
One year after sparking the #ArewaMeToo movement, Hashim told Global Voices that although their advocacy exposed the "rot within society", it also took its toll.
Hashim experienced major online harassment when her group confronted "an alleged serial abuser of minors" who works at the finance ministry as part of their online advocacy.
She told Global Voices:
We launched a campaign against him [the serial abuser], demanding that he be sacked by the minister; some people did not like that so they orchestrated an online targeted harassment campaign to delegitimise ArewaMeToo.
According to Hashim, harassers attempted to delegitimise ArewaMeToo by associating ArewaMeToo with LGBTQ [lesbians, gay, bisexual transgender and queer people] and their strategy worked as online harassment gained momentum, Hashim said.
In Nigeria, gay marriage is illegal and under Sharia and penal legal codes, sodomy and lesbianism are punishable in some states.
By associating Haashim's movement with LGBTQ rights, online trolls distorted their message and framed #ArewaToo and NorthNormal as illegitimate.
However, Global Voices was not able to independently verify tweets that pinned Hashim's movement to LGBTQ rights.
Still, Hashim posts messages of hope on Twitter:
Fakhriyyah Hashim, co-founder of #ArewaToo and NorthNormal (Image used with her permission).
She said all these experiences helped her grow a "really thick skin":
In my experience of being loud on political Twitter for good governance, I’ve grown a really thick skin, but even that didn't prepare me for the amount of backlash we got through ArewaMeToo and NorthNormal.
Though I mustered all of that and did not retreat to any cave, I did begin feeling demoralised about Northern Nigeria’s governanace and response to sexual violence...
After every episode of attacks, we did gather more strength and energy to push back because the backlash made us see how society enforced the culture of silence and if we allowed our lips to be sealed then that would be the real tragedy.
Sadly, Hashim and Ezekwesili still struggle with the excruciating "lack of empathy" that characterises discourse about gender-based violence on- and offline.
According to Hashim, this "deliberate maligning of a cause that only seeks better for victims of sexual violence" is incredibly difficult to grasp.

In Assad-controlled Syria, the official narrative is ‘no COVID-19 cases’
After nine years of a deadly civil war, the health system in Syria is barely functional.
In territories controlled by President Bashar al-Assad, authorities deny the presence of COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the country has confirmed 439 cases and 21 deaths as of July 15.
But narratives on the ground reveal the ways in which the state has denied and repressed the realities of COVID-19.
Walid Abdullah, 23, says the state has even gone so far as to suggest terminating the lives of suspected COVID-19 patients.
Global Voices is using a pseudonym upon request to protect his identity.
Speaking to Global Voices by phone, Abdullah explained that on May 13, he called Daraa National Hospital, in southern Syria, to inform them about a suspected case of coronavirus.
When he asked what steps should be taken, the government hospital employee who answered the phone said: "Shoot him — we have no cure for him", according to Abdullah.
He quickly ended the call.
Obviously, the idea of shooting a suspected COVID-19 patient was out of the question.
"Death by COVID-19 is more honorable than to set foot in any public hospital", Abdullah told Global Voices.
This harrowing testimony is corroborated by other sources.
In a March 10 report published in The Voice of the Capital, an independent Syrian newspaper, medical personnel from the Syrian Ministry of Health claimed that "deliberate termination operations are taking place at the al-Mujtahid government hospital in the capital, Damascus, for those who are believed to be carrying the virus, through giving them additional doses of the drug [anesthetic]".
This claim also appeared on social media:
Another person from al-Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus was also quoted in the same article confirming this claim:
"These terminations are conducted in complete secrecy and are carried out by doctors dedicated to following up on cases of suspected virus infection".
The Assad regime's desperate approach to dealing with COVID-19 parallels callous strategies used in Assad’s war, which left 586,100 people dead, nearly 100,000 detained and forcibly disappeared, and 5.6 million refugees around the world.
Virus outbreak and regime survival
The Assad regime owes its survival to its key allies, including Iran. With few allies in the region, Iran has leaned on Syria as well.
In February, Iran became one of the world's most COVID-19 affected countries and is a likely source of infection in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, where Iranian troops have had physical contact through military cooperation.
Additionally, Iranian pilgrims and religious tourists, continued to visit Damascus-based shrines up until the first week of March, as reported by Zaki Mehchy, co-author of a March study published by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
However, the Assad regime has pursued a policy of misinformation, prevarication and denial in terms of the number of COVID-19 casualties.
In a March 13 interview with the official Syrian News Channel, Minister of Health Nizar Al-Yaziji insisted on denying the existence of any COVID-19 cases in Syria, saying:
"Thank God that the Syrian Arab Army has cleansed the Syrian soil from many germs:"
The Syrian Ministry of Health did not announce its first case of COVID-19 until March 22, causing resentment and anger among Syrians who noted that the Assad regime lied and pursued a policy of denial.
In an article published on an independent Syria 24 news site in response to Yaziji’s claims, one citizen poignantly asked, "didn’t you say in your statement that all germs have been eliminated?"
However, the regime has continued to report implausibly low numbers.
In a statement dated April 1, the Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces called on the international community to put pressure on the regime to disclose verified data regarding COVID-19 cases.
Stressing the assumed existence of a large number of casualties, the coalition wrote:
A broken health care system
Recognizing the pandemic is embarrassing for the Assad regime because it forces authorities to admit that the health system is non-existent.
According to the LSE study, the maximum number of COVID-19 infections that can be treated in the Syrian health sector is estimated to be only 6,500 in a nation of 17.5 million inhabitants.
If casualties exceed this capacity, the health system, already worn out by the war, is likely to collapse.
Throughout the war, military attacks have caused widespread damage to the health sector.
Data from the World Health Organization and the Syrian Ministry of Health show that only 58 hospitals are fully operational among the country’s 111 public hospitals.
The data also noted that up to 70 percent of health workers have left the country as migrants or refugees, while the rest are often subjected to restrictions, including military and political interference.
COVID-19 amid ongoing humanitarian disaster
Perhaps the biggest challenge many Syrians face is the accumulation of disasters: war, a pandemic, and famine.
The United Nations warned on June 26 that Syria is now facing an "unprecedented" hunger crisis, with urgent action still needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
According to the World Food Program, food prices rose by 11 percent in May compared to April, and 133 percent when compared to the same period in 2019.
As the economic situation deteriorates, 28-year-old Ali al-Ahmed (also a pseudonym upon request to protect his identity) from Daraa city told Global Voices in a phone interview that "the situation is bad, regardless of how much you work, even if you make 10,000 SYP a day [between $1 and $5 USD] it will not be enough".
Ahmed said most people have been forced to forgo many basic goods due to exorbitant costs.
Between a health care system shattered by years of war and an economic situation that has left many Syrians impoverished, the ongoing pandemic has pushed the country toward uncharted, catastrophic territory.
YKS, with 2.5 million students, is taking place despite all the warnings: social distancing disappeared
A new YKS controversy: morality
COVID-19 is not the only debate surrounding YKS in 2020.
An even more impassioned discussion started in early July in relation to a text selected for the Turkish language exam.
One of the questions referred to the song by pop singer Mabel Matiz, a member of the LGBTQ.
The question about the meaning of “Gözümün gördüğü, göğsümün bildiği ile bir değil” (which can be translated as “what my eyes see is not what my heart feels”) has left its mark on social media because of Mabel's popularity among young people (some of his videos have 50 million views) and his sexual orientation.
Following growing debates on Twitter, Halis Aygün, the president of the Center for Measurement, Selection and Placement (ÖSYM), the government body responsible for preparing the exam, gave an interview to far-right conservative media Yeni Akit in which he said the matter would be investigated and that those responsible for including the text would be fired:
The 2020 YKS was completed safely and successfully in 188 exam centers in three sessions with the participation of approximately two and a half million candidates.
The question pool is created with the participation of thousands of academicians from different universities of our country.
The sensitivity of the management of our institution about our national, moral values and social value judgments is clear.
An investigation has been launched into the content of the relevant question in the Turkish area of the 2020 YKS's TYT [this refers to one portion of the YKS exam] session.
The members of staff responsible will be discharged from the process of question preparation.
For some Twitter users, those measures aren't enough:
[Top] ÖSYM President spoke for the first time after the exam!
“An investigation has been launched into the content of the problem.
Responsible persons will be removed from the question preparation processes. “
[Bottom] It is not enough [to remove him], the neglecting president must be removed from the management process so that he is properly done with.
Conservative segments of society also question the intention behind the choice of that question:
In today's YKS2020 exam, couldn't you find anyone else to show to teenagers other than the gay and LGBT advocate Mabel Matiz?
(The one who carries a banner saying “we are faggots”) What are you trying to do?
Public opinion remains largely divided as other Twitter users point out the success and popularity of Mabel Matiz:
Dear investigative board members, I recommend that you watch Mabel Matiz's clips. Because we have no other artists who have embraced our culture this way for many years. That's why mabelmatiz is the treasure of our land. He is a unique “artist”
This netizen draws attention to the fact that by focusing on a gay singer politicians avoid addressing real issues:
Nobody makes any noise about rapists, yet Mabel Matiz question becomes the subject of an investigation.
You say “our social value judgments” but Mabel Matiz is the best reflector of our culture.
Thus investigation should be about the ones who insult Mabel Matiz and discriminate against him.
Mabel Matiz's response to the controversy.
On July 3, as the debate became more heated, Matiz finally broke his silence:
Hi:) I was very happy that my music was be the subject of such an important exam.
Now I am amazed at how my personal values are subject of the same exam.
Look what I was tested with, while the geographical sign logo was about placed next to my name.
Well, I say that life's exams never end :) Another roll call came from here.
I read your intense messages of support.
I understand what I want to say with my music, I sense that you understand me, and I feel even stronger now.
I will continue to make my music, tell stories, and be part of this country.
See you in another exam…
Matiz remains very popular: Just one day after Aygun's statement.
He received two awards in a competition based on the popular vote.
He won in two categories.
“Best Clip” and “Best Male Singer” at the 46th Pantene Golden Butterfly Awards.
This seems to indicate that very large numbers of people support him against the homophobia expressed by the government and conservative citizens.
On July 5, Mabel Matiz tweeted again:
I received the “Best Male Artist” and “Best Video Clip” awards at the 46th Golden Butterfly Awards, I am happy!
Thanks to all my dear listeners! I would like to extend my thanks to Erhan Arık and DOP Meryem Yavuz, the precious directors of [my song] “I Have a Red in My Wipe” clip.
In Turkey, 2.5m students sit university entry exam despite COVID-19 outbreak
This year's exam was embroiled in controversy—and not just because of the pandemic
Posted 17 July 2020 12:54 GMT
Screenshot of the YouTube video featuring a song by Mabel Matiz including the lyrics at the heart of the current controversy around the Higher Education Institutions Exam (YKS):
"Gözümün gördüğü, göğsümün bildiği ile bir değil" ("what my eyes see is not what my heart feels")
In Turkey, a country of over 83 million people, one needs to pass an entry test, the Higher Education Institution Exam, called Yükseköğretim Kurumları Sınavı in Turkish (YKS) to enter university.
This year, the multiple-choice questionnaire was taken in physical spaces by 2.5 million people, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 26, the Council of Higher Education announced the dates for YKS as July 25-26.
On May 4, Turkish President Recep Erdoğan changed them to June 27 and 28.
The changes and the uncertainties around the exam amid the COVID-19 pandemic launched countless discussions in Turkish society and on social media:
How do date changes affect the psychology of students, given the level of stress associated to YKS for which candidates prepare for months?
How would COVID-19 prevention measures be applied and respected (social distancing, temperature measurements, the use of masks) when bringing together 2.5 million people?
In 2019, 74.16 percent of the candidates passed the first part of YKS, and only 39.4 percent succeeded in the second part of the exam.
Turkey registered its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 11, and by July 15, around 5,500 people infected with the virus have died, while there have been more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the disease in the country.
On July 1, the government enforced special normalization measures:
Businesses such as restaurants, cafes, cinemas and wedding halls that had been closed for about three months reopened with social distancing restrictions.
Patrons are now required to wear masks and will have their temperature taken as well.
While students and opposition parties called for a further postponement of the YKS, the government went ahead with its plans:
In late June, 2.5 million people took the exam.
As can be seen in this tweet, concerns over enforcement of social distancing in this context proved to be legitimate:
YKS, with 2.5 million students, is taking place despite all the warnings: social distancing disappeared
A new YKS controversy: morality
COVID-19 is not the only debate surrounding YKS in 2020.
An even more impassioned discussion started in early July in relation to a text selected for the Turkish language exam.

Workers’ Day Celebration: House Speaker tasks Nigerian workers on productivity
The Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives Mr Femi Gbajabiamila has congratulated the Nigerian workers for marking this year’s International Workers’ Day.
Mr Gbajabiamila said although the day is being marked quietly across the globe as a result of the lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is much to remember about the sacrifices made by Nigerian workers.
In a statement marking the Workers’ Day signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker commended the Nigerian workers for their commitment and dedication to work over the years, which he said has shaped the country tremendously.
He, however, called on Nigerian workers to be more productive now and always, saying no matter what was achieved before now must be sustained and improved upon for the country to achieve more.
“I want to salute the courage of Nigerian workers, who have over the years given their best to their work.
Indeed Nigeria and Nigerians are proud of you.
I urge the Nigerian workers to redouble their efforts at this time of our national development.
They must continue to put in their best in the work that they do for the betterment of the country.”
--- May Day: Senate President felicitates with Nigerian workers
President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has felicitated with Nigerian workers as they join their counterparts the world over to mark the Workers’ Day.
Senator Lawan also congratulated Nigerian workers for sustaining their heroic struggle for the liberation of the country from poverty and underdevelopment even in the face of the daunting challenges at various workplaces.
He acknowledged the role of workers as the creator of wealth in society and stressed that it is for this reason that they should be appreciated at all times.
The best way to appreciate the enormous contributions of the Nigerian workers is to always consider their welfare as of utmost importance.
"As a legislature, we are ever ready to work in collaboration with the organised labour Unions to rid our statute books of any anti-labour laws," Lawan said.
The Senate President said as part of the effort of the 9th National Assembly to strengthen the economy and improve the standard of living of the people, it is determined to make the country’s financial year predictable through the timely passage of the 2020 budget.
According to Senator Lawan, the National Assembly has in the same respect made critical amendments to some laws to ensure smooth implementation of the budget.
He said the Legislature would continue to move relentlessly in that direction, despite the unforeseen challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Senate President noted that this year’s celebration of Workers’ Day comes at a time the entire world is facing the health emergency brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic.
"It is the resilience and never-die spirit of the Nigerian people that will boost the efforts of the government to overcome the pandemic," he stated.
The Senate President urged the Nigerian workers, as they mark their day, to adhere strictly to all the prescribed public health protocols of social distancing, wearing of face mask, use of hand sanitizer, observance of personal hygiene, and to endeavour to stay at home and stay safe.

--- Re-opening of schools not yet in view – Minister
The Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba says he cannot for-see or immediately tell when schools will be reopened.
The Minister also said re-opening of schools will be in tandem with President Muhammadu Buhari’s gradual ease of the lockdown put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Nwajiuba who had earlier during the daily briefing said that the government is not ready to put the lives of children at risk, warned that no school should engage students except when a formal date of resumption is announced by the government.
” In anyway none of these schools can function outside the society”.
The Minister also said that all entrance examinations that had been postponed will hold when the government is satisfied that the students have understood the syllabus as planned.
The Minister clarified that both the West African Examination Council for Senior School Students and other National Examinations including NABTEB are not cancelled but only postponed.
He acknowledged challenges in the deployment of the e-learning policy hence the engagement of the State Universal Basic Education Boards.
According to him,” we know some are limited by access and the access is limited by device, some can only get on the continuation of their academic program via radio, some at the television level, some are using computer online system, so we are doing this in partnership with states meaning that every gap we intend to bridge as regards the education of these children nationwide, we had to pass through every state Governor through their SUBEBS”
“Presently we have time table for 31 states out of 36 states, which means via Radio or T.v, teaching and learning are ongoing, these are time tables that suit each state but the federal government has only provided guideline via online content”
“Using these SUBEBs ,the same way we share their interventions with them is the same way this teaching and learning online content is been shared and the FG informed that they could use state media that is appropriate in their areas”. Nwajiuba said.
The Minister added that the COVID 19 pandemic has helped all stakeholders to retool and has also helped everybody to get on board.
Speaking on the Sustainability of the e-learning policy, the Minister said the government will further engage master teachers that will perfect the system that will transcend its use after the Coronavirus health challenge facing the world.
Meanwhile the Education Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA, has issued a warning to some private Schools disseminating information to parents and students indicating the resumption of the 2019/2020 3rd term calendar online.
The FCTA Education Secretary, Umaru Marafa said in a statement released on Tuesday that no academic activities in all Schools in any form should commence until a notice to reopen is approved and conveyed by the Secretariat”
“The Implication of this is that when the Schools will be reopened, adequate notice of the fact that 2nd term was inconclusive will be factored into the academic calendar which will dovetail into the 3rd term accordingly. Any action taken otherwise is likely to negatively distort the academic calendar of the schools involved” Marafa said.
School proprietors are therefore, advised to maintain the status quo and keep their schools closed and not re-open in any form while they await further directives from the FCTA.
Violators of this directive will face the full wrath of the law.
Marafa further disclosed that the FCTA Education Secretariat has concluded plans to introduce e-learning platforms to include lessons on radio and television channels to keep the students constructively engaged while the lockdown lasts.
--- No private school must start work – Minister FCT
The Minister for the Federal capital territory (FCT), Alhaji Muhammad Musa Bello has warned the proprietors of private schools in Abuja that have started informing parents and students that very soon they will start work for the third term for the present 2019/2020 academic session, to be careful so that they will not face the wrath of government law.
Senior secretary for education in the federal capital territory, Umaru Marafa said this in a statement released on Tuesday that no academic activities in all Schools in any form should commence until a notice to reopen is approved and conveyed by the Secretariat”
“We are appealing to private school proprietors to allow all their schools to remain closed, they must not try to open the school except there is a notice or guideline from ministry of FCTA”
All those that go against this rule shall face the wrath of law.
Marafa continued that Ministry of FCTA in charge of education has planned to start teaching by using the knowledge of internet, the use of television to teach the students in the period of lockdown.
--- FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI’S NATIONWIDE BROADCAST
ADDRESS BY H.E. MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE CUMULATIVE LOCKDOWN ORDER OF LAGOS AND OGUN STATES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY ON COVID- 19 PANDEMIC AT THE STATE HOUSE, ABUJA, MONDAY, 27th APRIL, 2020
1. Fellow Nigerians
2. I will start by commending you all for the resilience and patriotism that you have shown in our collective fight against the biggest health challenge of our generation.
3. As at yesterday, 26th April 2020, some 3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been recorded globally with about 900,000 recoveries. Unfortunately, some 200,000 people have passed away as a result of this pandemic.
4. The health systems and economies of many nations continue to struggle as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
5. Nigeria continues to adapt to these new global realities on a daily basis. Today, I will present the facts as they are and explain our plans for the coming months fully aware that some key variables and assumptions may change in the coming days or weeks.
6. Exactly two weeks ago, there were 323 confirmed cases in 20 States and the Federal Capital Territory.
7. As at this morning, Nigeria had recorded 1,273 cases across 32 States and the FCT. Unfortunately, this includes 40 deaths.
8. I am using this opportunity to express our deepest condolences to the families of all Nigerians that have lost their loved ones as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is our collective loss and we share your grief.
9. Initial models predicted that Nigeria will record an estimated 2,000 confirmed cases in the first month after the index case.
10. This means that despite the increase in the number of confirmed cases recorded in the past two weeks, the measures we have put in place thus far have yielded positive outcomes against the projections.
11. The proportion of cases imported from other countries has reduced to only 19% of new cases, showing that our border closures yielded positive results. These are mostly fellow Nigerians returning through our land borders. We will continue to enforce land border arrival protocols as part of the containment strategy.
12. Today, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has accredited 15 laboratories across the country with an aggregate capacity to undertake 2,500 tests per day across the country.
13. Based on your feedback, Lagos State Government and the FCT with support from NCDC have established several sample collection centers. They are also reviewing their laboratory testing strategy to further increase the number of tests they can perform including the accreditation of selected private laboratories that meet the accreditation criteria.
14. Several new fully equipped treatment and isolation centres have been operationalised across the country thereby increasing bed capacity to about three thousand.
15. I commend the State Governors for the activation of State-level Emergency Operation Centres, establishment of new treatment centres and the delivery of aggressive risk communication strategies.
16. Over 10,000 healthcare workers have been trained. For their protection, additional personal protective equipment have been distributed to all the states.
17. Although we have experienced logistical challenges, we remain committed to establishing a solid supply chain process to ensure these heroic professionals can work safely and are properly equipped.
18. In keeping with our Government’s promise to improve the welfare of healthcare workers, we have signed a memorandum of understanding on the provision of hazard allowances and other incentives with key health sector professional associations.
19. We have also procured insurance cover for 5,000 frontline health workers. At this point, I must commend the insurance sector for their support in achieving this within a short period of time.
20. Nigeria has also continued to receive support from the international community, multilateral agencies, the private sector and public-spirited individuals. This support has ensured that critical lifesaving equipment and materials, which have become scarce globally, are available for Nigeria through original equipment manufacturers and government-to-government processes.
21. The distribution and expansion of palliatives which I directed in my earlier broadcast is still on-going in a transparent manner. I am mindful of the seeming frustration being faced by expectant citizens. I urge all potential beneficiaries to exercise patience as we continue to fine tune our logistical and distribution processes working with the State Governments.
22. Our Security Agencies continue to rise to the challenge posed by this unusual situation. While we feel deeply concerned about isolated security incidents, I want to assure all Nigerians that your safety and security remain our primary concern especially in these difficult and uncertain times.
23. As we focus on protecting lives and properties, we will not tolerate any human rights abuse by our security agencies. The few reported incidences are regrettable, and I want to assure you that the culprits will be brought to justice.
24. I urge all Nigerians to continue to cooperate and show understanding whenever they encounter security agents. Furthermore, for their protection, I have instructed that the personnel of all the security agencies be provided with the necessary personal protective equipment against infection.
25. As we continue to streamline our response in the centres of Lagos and the FCT, I am gravely concerned about the unfortunate developments in Kano in recent days. Although an in-depth investigation is still on-going, we have decided to deploy additional Federal Government manpower, material and technical resources to strengthen and support the State Government’s efforts, with immediate effect.
26. In Kano, and indeed many other States that are recording new cases, preliminary findings show that such cases are mostly from interstate travel and emerging community transmission.
27. Drawing from these, I implore all Nigerians to continue to adhere strictly to the advisories published by the Presidential Task Force and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
28. These include regular hand washing, physical distancing, wearing of face masks/coverings in public, avoidance of non-essential movement and travels and avoidance of large gatherings.
29. Fellow Nigerians, for the past four weeks, most parts of our country have been under either Federal Government or State Government lockdown. As I mentioned earlier, these steps were necessary and overall, have contributed to slowing down the spread of COVID-19 in our country.
30. However, such lockdowns have also come at a very heavy economic cost. Many of our citizens have lost their means of livelihood. Many businesses have shut down. No country can afford the full impact of a sustained lockdown while awaiting the development of vaccines.
31. In my last address, I mentioned that Federal Government will develop strategies and policies that will protect lives while preserving livelihoods.
32. In these two weeks, the Federal and State Governments have jointly and collaboratively worked hard on how to balance the need to protect health while also preserving livelihoods, leveraging global best practices while keeping in mind our peculiar circumstances.
33. We assessed how our factories, markets, traders and transporters can continue to function while at the same time adhering to NCDC guidelines on hygiene and social distancing.
34. We assessed how our children can continue to learn without compromising their health.
35. We reviewed how our farmers can safely plant and harvest in this rainy season to ensure our food security is not compromised. Furthermore, we also discussed how to safely transport food items from rural production areas to industrial processing zones and ultimately, to the key consumption centres.
36. Our goal was to develop implementable policies that will ensure our economy continues to function while still maintaining our aggressive response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These same difficult decisions are being faced by leaders around the world.
37. Based on the above and in line with the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the various Federal Government committees that have reviewed socio-economic matters and the Nigeria Governors Forum, I have approved a phased and gradual easing of lockdown measures in FCT, Lagos and Ogun States effective from Monday, 4th May, 2020.
38. However, this will be followed strictly with aggressive reinforcement of testing and contact tracing measures while allowing the restoration of some economic and business activities in certain sectors.
39. Furthermore, new nationwide measures are to be introduced as follows;
a. There will be an overnight curfew from 8pm to 6am. This means all movements will be prohibited during this period except for essential services;
b. There will be a ban on non-essential inter-state passenger travel until further notice;
c. Partial and controlled interstate movement of goods and services will be allowed for the movement of goods and services from producers to consumers; and
d. We will strictly ensure the mandatory use of face masks or coverings in public in addition to maintaining physical distancing and personal hygiene. Furthermore, the restrictions on social and religious gatherings shall remain in place. State Governments, corporate organisations and philanthropists are encouraged to support the production of cloth masks for citizens.
40. For the avoidance of doubt, the lockdown in the FCT, Lagos and Ogun States shall remain in place until these new ones come into effect on Monday, 4th May 2020.
41. The Presidential Task Force shall provide sector specific details to allow for preparations by Governments, businesses and institutions.
42. In respect to the above guidelines, State Governors may choose to adapt and expand based on their unique circumstances provided they maintain alignment with the guidelines issued above.
43. To support our businesses and traders, the monetary and fiscal authorities shall deploy all the necessary provisions needed for production to continue and thus, jobs restored.
44. These revised guidelines will not apply to Kano State.
45. With regards to Kano, I have directed the enforcement of a total lockdown for a period of two weeks effective immediately. The Federal Government shall deploy all the necessary human, material and technical resources to support the State in controlling and containing the pandemic and preventing the risk of further spread to neighboring States.
46. I wish to once again, commend the frontline workers across the country who, on a daily basis, risk everything to ensure we win this fight. For those who got infected in the line of duty, rest assured that Government will do all it takes to support you and your families during this exceedingly difficult period. I will also take this opportunity to assure you all that your safety, wellbeing and welfare remain paramount to our Government.
47. I will also recognize the support we have received from our traditional rulers, the Christian Association of Nigeria, the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs and other prominent religious and community leaders. Your cooperation and support have significantly contributed to the successes we have recorded to date.
48. I will urge you all to please continue to create awareness on the seriousness of the coronavirus among your worshippers and communities while appealing that they strictly comply with public health advisories.
49. I also thank the Nigeria Governors’ Forum and the Presidential Task Force for all their hard work to date. Through this collaboration, I remain confident that success is achievable.
50. I also wish to thank corporate organizations, philanthropists, the UN system, the European Union, friendly nations, the media and other partners that have taken up the responsibility of supporting our response.
51. And finally, I will thank all Nigerians again for your patience and cooperation during this difficult and challenging period. I assure you that government shall continue to take all necessary measures to protect the lives and livelihoods of our citizens and residents.
52. I thank you for listening and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria
