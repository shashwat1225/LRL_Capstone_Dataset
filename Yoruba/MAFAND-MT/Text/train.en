Local radio station in Russia cancels interview with LGBT activists after threats to editor
Activists in Madrid protest LGBT rights violations in Russia
Echo of Moscow in Yaroslavl, a local affiliate of Echo of Moscow, Russia’s oldest independent radio network, cancelled an interview with LGBT activists after receiving homophobic threats, the station’s editor Lyudmila Shabuyeva said in a Facebook post:
Translation Original Quote
Yesterday we received threats against our guests and ourselves if we proceed with our talk show about LGBT.
I’m cancelling the show.
According to independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the show featuring Yaroslavl’s LGBT activists was scheduled to air in the early morning of Wednesday, January 23.
The same activists had recently picketed the town’s main square to protest against the persecution of gay people in Russia, notably in the republic of Chechnya.
The station invited them to be interviewed about the protest and their experience of being openly gay in provincial Russia.
Shabuyeva’s initial announcement of the show attracted a torrent of homophobic abuse in the comments, including some from local officials, but that didn’t put her off, she told Novaya Gazeta.
However, late in the night before the show, Shabuyeva says, a stranger called her on the phone from an unidentified number and told her that if she were to proceed with the scheduled programming, her guests would be met outside the studio with baseball bats.
She could also face problems, the anonymous caller threatened.
Fearing for her guests’ safety, Shabuyeva cancelled the show and replaced it with another programming.
The picket on Yaroslavl’s main square was part of a national campaign #saveLGBTinRussia aimed at raising awareness about the brutal persecution of gay people in the republic of Chechnya.
Similar pickets and rallies were held in other Russian cities.
The Motherland Calls on her children (the citizens) to fight xenophobia and repressions in modern Russia.
Let her call awaken you!
[the sign says: RUSSIA’S DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COULD FIND NO GAYS IN CHECHYA.
THEY ARE THERE: IN PRISONS AND IN GRAVES.
#SAVELGBTINRUSSIA HOMOPHOBIA=FASCISM
In April 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported that the authorities of Chechnya, a troubled Muslim republic in the south of Russia ruled by a former warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, was waging a brutal campaign of repressions against its LGBT population.
Recent reports said the "purge" has been intensifying, with at least two victims dead and dozens held in illegal detention.
#FreeAmade: Journalist arrested and tortured after reporting on violence in northern Mozambique

Mozambican journalist Amade Abubacar was arrested on January 5, while reporting on a trend of violent attacks on small villages in Mozambique's province of Cabo Delgado.
Located in northern Mozambique, Cabo Delgado is rich with natural resources, such as ruby, charcoal and natural gas, found in the Rovuma Basin.
Some observers say the group coordinating the attacks intends to begin trafficking these resources.
Since October 2017, multiple attacks have been carried out in different districts of Cabo Delgado by what appears to be the same rogue group.
Many media have reported on the attacks, but state officials have been unwilling to comment on or confirm evidence in these cases.
In 2018, more than one hundred people were prosecuted together in relation to these crimes. Their trial is expected to end this year.
#FreeAmade: campaign to release Mozambican journalist
Amade Aoubacar works with the Mozambican Social Communication Institute and as a journalist with news site Zitamar and the local radio station, Nacedje.
The journalist was arrested and detained by Mozambican federal police on January 5, while photographing survivors of an attack in Cabo Delgado.
Amade was then taken to a military quarter of the Defense Forces of Mozambique in the district of Mueda, despite not being a member of the armed forces.
After a few weeks, he was transferred to a civilian prison to legalize his detention in Pemba, capital of Cabo Delgado .
After he arrived at the civilian prison, Amade contacted the Mozambican Order of Lawyers and reported having experienced torture at the hands of Mozambican armed forces, who he says beat him and deprived him of food.
Many individuals and media freedom groups have spoken out in his Abubacar's defense, saying that his arrest and detention have threatened the exercise of free expression.
The Media Institute of Southern Africa, which monitors media rights and activities in the region, spoke out strongly against Amade's detention:
Abubacar’s prolonged detention by the military is a violation of his rights as well as his arrest under unconfirmed charges.
The Mozambican government is setting a bad precedent in the violation of free expression and access to information in the region.
Amnesty International also released a statement:
Translation Original Quote
Amade Abubacar is a respected journalist who was recording testimony from people who fled deadly attacks in Cabo Delgado when he was arrested by police.
This is the latest demonstration of contempt coming from Mozambican authorities and directed at freedom of expression and freedom of the press...[authorities] view journalists as a threat and [thus they] are treated as criminals.
The campaign has also spread on Twitter, with the creation of hashtags like #FreeAmade to advocate for the liberation of Amade.
For the first time in Brazil's history, there is an indigenous woman in the National Congress
Joenia was the first indigenous woman to have a Law degree in Brazil.

In 1997, Joenia Wapichana became the first indigenous woman in Brazil to obtain a law degree.
Eleven years later, she was the first indigenous person ever to defend a case in the Supreme Court.
And in October 2018 Joenia earned yet another distinction, becoming the first indigenous woman elected to the National Congress.
Her 8,491 votes elected her to one of the eight seats destined to her home state, Roraima.
The only time Brazil had an indigenous congressman was in 1986 — Mario Juruna, of Xavante ethnicity, was elected in 1983.
Born in a Wapichana tribe, Joenia moved to Boa Vista, Roraima's state capital, when she was eight years old.
She juggled her law degree with a job at an accountant’s office and, she said in a recent interview, graduated a year earlier than expected, fifth in her class, and amongst the children of Roraima's oligarchy.
In December 2018, already as an elected congresswoman, Joenia won a UN human rights prize for her outstanding achievement in promoting indigenous peoples’ rights.
The same recognition has been given to Nelson Mandela and Malala.

Joênia made history in 2008 when she argued a case brought by five indigenous groups to have their land officially demarcated as an Indigenous Territory, a type of tenure that confers indigenous peoples inalienable rights over their traditional homelands.
The court ruled in favor of the indigenous groups, who now are permanent possessors of the largest Indigenous Territory in Brazil — the lands of Raposa Terra do Sol, located in the state of Roraima.
Meanwhile, Jair Bolsonaro, still a congressman at that time, insulted an indigenous activist who had attended a public hearing at the Chamber of Deputies about the Raposa Terra do Sol demarcation.
"You should go outside and eat grass to keep with your origins," Bolsonaro said on the occasion.
Shortly after his electoral victory in 2018, Bolsonaro brought up Raposa Terra do Sol again as an example of an indigenous territory whose economic potential should be exploited.
He told reporters:
Translation Original Quote
It’s the richest area in the world. You can exploit it in a rational manner.
And, from the indigenous’ side, giving them royalties and integrating them to society.
Ten years ago, with red painting on her face, in the tradition of her ethnicity, Joenia mixed Portuguese and her native language to remind the Justices that around three million US dollars circulated within those lands every year without that counting towards the Brazil's economy.
"We are slandered and discriminated inside our own land", she said.

A formidable opponent
While she prepared to take her congressional seat as an opponent of Bolsonaro’s government, she told reporters at Folha de São Paulo, a national newspaper:
Translation Original Quote
Why does he [Bolsonaro] persecute indigenous people so much?
What is the reason for such hate and appetite for retreat?
We have tourism, traditional medicine, a vast biodiversity in the Amazon.
We need to change this belief that we are a hindrance to development, that we are hurting A or B.
We must become protagonists ourselves as well.
Hitting the ground running
Brazil's Congress took office in February 2019 and Joênia began her term as the leader of her party, Rede Sustentabilidade (or Sustainability Network in Portuguese), in the Chamber of Deputies, the federal legislature's lower house.
Rede was founded by former Environment Minister Marina Silva, who despite losing three consecutive presidential elections is a household name in Brazil's environmental activism.
Following the dam disaster in Brumadinho, a tragedy that killed over 160 people and destroyed all life at the Paraopeba River, Joenia presented her first bill proposal, which renders environmental crimes that seriously affect ecosystems, human health, and lives, "heinous crimes", a type of offense that incurs in more severe penalties.
A day before taking office, the congresswoman told Folha de Boa Vista, a local newspaper from her home state, that the bill addresses private corporations’ carelessness with the environment:
Translation Original Quote
We are concerned with the government's policies of weakening mechanisms that were created to protect a healthy environment, as foreseen in our Constitution, and the associated social impacts.
[Among those mechanisms], for instance, there is the environmental licensing process, [which helps curb] the lack of accountability by companies and the low power of control by the State.
Speaking with the BBC, Joenia says her top priority in Congress will be the demarcation of indigenous lands:
Translation Original Quote
If on one hand you have half a dozen ruralists, on the other there is a whole population of minorities that see themselves represented by me in there.
It’s a group that needs representation. The old politics is made out of people who only think about individual gains. I will bring collective values.
Burundi: Scribble on the president's picture — go to jail
Scribblers in solidarity

Six students were detained on Tuesday, March 12, in Kirundo province in northeast Burundi for scribbling on pictures of President Pierre Nkurunziza in five textbooks.
The students were accused of "insulting the head of state."
The National Federation of Associations Engaged in Children's Welfare in Burundi (FENADEB) reported that another student, 13, had been immediately released because he was a minor under the age of 15.
Three students were reportedly provisionally released on Friday, March 15, but, the remaining three were kept in custody.
The girls, aged 15 to 17, if found guilty, risk up to five years in prison for insulting the president.
Iwacu newspaper reported that families affected were deeply distressed.
Scribbling [on the president’s picture] is a punishable offense under the Burundian law, according to a Reuters report.
However, the age of the offenders may serve as a “mitigating circumstance” in these students’ trial.
As a teacher anonymously noted, the textbooks had not been checked for several years and are often shared by students, so it is difficult to know who marked them.
A similar episode occurred in 2016, following the controversy over the president’s third term, where high school students scribbled on textbook pictures of Nkurunziza.
Authorities took this as a serious insult and expelled hundreds of students from various schools across the country.
Eleven students were charged with "insulting the head of state" and "threatening state security", although they were reportedly later cleared.
These actions were highly criticized.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement on June 29, 2016:
I am dismayed by continuing reports of the suspension and arrest of schoolchildren and students for having scribbled on pictures of the president in textbooks.
Nkurunziza, the ‘eternal supreme guide’
Pierre Nkurunziza has been president of Burundi since 2005.
In 2015, he was controversially nominated by his party for a third term in office.
In March last year, Nkurunziza was named "eternal supreme guide" by his political party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD).
Evariste Ndayishimiye, CNDD-FDD’s secretary general explained why that title was conferred on Nkurunziza:
He is our leader, therefore in our party, no one is comparable to him.
He is our parent, he is the one who advises us.
That is why I ask all our members to respect that because a home without the man (its head) can be overlooked by anybody.
For us, we have the best.
While the CNDD-FDD downplayed the title, Nkurunziza’s reinforced status as the "eternal supreme guide" has made it difficult for anyone to disagree with his choices, including his move to change the two-term limit enshrined in the country’s constitution.
This reflects a centralization of power in the ruling party around Nkurunziza and supporters, and of the party’s control of state institutions.
Scribblers in solidarity
Netizens have taken to scribbling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in protest through two hashtags: #Nkurunziza and #Burundi:
Crackdown on criticism
Burundi's government has become increasingly sensitive to criticism since 2015, after a failed coup, clashes with rebel groups, criticisms of rights abuses, sanctions, economic hardships and a refugee crisis.
Nkurunziza’s third term bid was opposed by the European Union, and the United Nations, who demanded a restoration of stability before elections.
Faced with these challenges, a siege mentality hardened, and authorities clamped down more harshly on perceived threats.
The Human Rights Watch May 2018 special report discovered that Burundian state security forces, intelligence services, and members of the ruling party’s youth league, the Imbonerakure, carried out brutal, targeted attacks on opponents or suspected opponents, human rights activists, and journalists.
"Killing an estimated 1,700 people and forcibly disappearing, raping, torturing, beating, arbitrarily detaining, and intimidating countless others."
This has led to a refugee crisis that has seen Burundians fleeing particularly to Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda.
While thousands have returned, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded over 347,000 total Burundian refugees in February 2019 UNHCR asserts:
...Political unrest in Burundi took a deadly turn in 2015 after the president announced plans to seek a third term.
Street protests led to violent clashes, and hundreds of thousands fled to nearby countries in search of safety.”
Earlier this month, Burundi closed the United Nations human rights office after 23 years, saying it was no longer needed.
The government was incensed with former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who described Nkurunziza’s Burundi as one of the "most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times" in February 2018.
Media outlet closures, harassment of opponents, and clampdowns on NGOs and restrictions in political space for alternative narratives and arguments.
For example, rights activist Germain Rukiki who documented acts of torture committed by Nkurunziza’s regime was sentenced to 32 years in jail in 2018 for participation in an insurrectional movement, undermining state security and rebellion.
Rukiki's trial was also marred by irregularities and came weeks before the controversial constitutional referendum.
The "scribbling affair" is also indicative of the government’s increasingly conservative, moralizing approach, including mandatory marriages for cohabiting non-married couples in 2017, clampdowns on prostitution and begging.
CEO of carpooling service disinvited from interview on Russian state media after producer found out she was a woman
The channel said their audience had "certain stereotypes"

Irina Reyder, the CEO of the Russian affiliate of carpooling service BlaBlaCar, says she was disinvited from an interview with state-owned Channel One when the program’s editor realized she was a woman.
Reyder wrote on her Facebook page about the incident. She says she was listening in on the call between Channel One’s producer and BlaBlaCar’s PR officer and recorded the exchange between them:
Translation Original Quote
E (an editor for Good Morning show): Here’s the format: our reporter is driving a car while interviewing your expert.
PR (PR officer for BlaBlaCar): Yes, great.
E: And who will be the expert?
PR: Our CEO Irina Reyder.
E: Oh... you had a great guy once, didn’t you?
PR: Yes, we had Alexey Lazorenko as CEO, now it’s Irina Reyder.
E: Yes, I know about the changes in your leadership last year.
But Irina won’t work as an expert.
You see, our audience has certain stereotypes...
You know, like when there’s a good lawyer.
It’s usually a man.
Or someone who knows a lot about cars — a man, but not a woman.
Maybe you, Sergey, can give us an interview?
When Reyder’s PR officer Sergey told the editor that there weren’t any male experts in the company, she says, the latter promised to come back later after consulting with their producer.
On a call later, they told BlaBlaCar’s representative that the story's format had changed and they would be interviewing the service’s users instead.
“What do you think?
Will the new experts be expertly enough?
Reyder asked her followers sarcastically.
In a comment to TJournal, a tech and social media news outlet.
Channel One’s own press office didn’t deny the veracity of the exchange, but insisted the approach was not sexist in nature.
However, their explanation didn’t offer solid support to that claim:
Translation Original Quote
Two reporters, a young man and a woman, intend to demonstrate the difference between male and female approach to savings.
The young woman reporter will be interviewing male experts, while the young man will be interviewing women.
Because the woman reporter’s goal is to save on car rides, she will be speaking to a representative of a carpooling service (yes, because of the show’s structure, not gender inequality, that has to be a man.)
How a woman’s approach to savings is different from that of a man, Channel One didn’t elaborate.
But the public wasn’t convinced either way, and the TV network's approach was met with criticism.
BlaBlaCar’s CEO Irina Reyder said she was disinvited from the Good Morning show on Channel One by the editor when they found out she was a woman.
It’s quite surprising that there are still aspects to Channel One’s madness we haven’t known about.
Despite the significant backlash that Channel One faced online, Russia still has a long way to go in terms of gender equality.
Russia ranks 75th among 149 countries surveyed by the World Economic Forum's 2018 Global Gender Gap Report, scoring good points for equal access to healthcare and education for women, but lacking in legislation protecting their rights.
Russian feminists and their supporters often use social media and satire to shine a light on sexist customs and practices.
China's campaign against Christmas makes celebrating a difficult choice for citizens
Written on the classroom boards: "Act and reject Western festival" and "Promote traditional culture, reject Western festival".
Images from Weibo.
Christmas is approaching but instead of feeling joyful, many in mainland China have expressed frustration over China's ideological campaign against Christmas as a Western festival.
In 2017, the Communist Party of China's central committee and state council issued an official document entitled "Suggestions on the implementation of projects to promote and develop traditional Chinese culture excellence".
They outlined a cultural revival project that lists Chinese festivals like the Lunar New Year and the Lantern Festival, among others, as cultural conventions worthy of celebration.
To implement this policy, Chinese authorities have launched a series of ideological campaigns to crack down on non-Chinese celebrations.
This year, just before Christmas, authorities in some cities such as Langfang, in Hebei province, have demanded shops to remove Christmas decorations on the streets and in window displays.
Anti-Western festival commentaries have flooded Chinese social media, making Christmas celebrations a difficult choice for some who feel they must keep their joy a secret.
Weibo user Long Zhigao screen captured his WeChat newsfeed on Weibo to reveal aspects of the debate.
The headlines on the feed are
1. Western festival is approaching.
To celebrate or not, that’s the question.
2. I am Chinese and I don’t celebrate Western festivals.
3. Say no to the celebration of Western festivals on the school campus.
4. The party-state has banned Western festivals.
The celebration of festivals is now a political issue.
In addition to Christmas, the list of Western festivals also includes Valentine’s Day, Easter and Halloween, among others.
A majority of the commentaries define Western festivals as "cultural invasion" or "national humiliation".
For example, a widely circulated one said:
Translation Original Quote
If people of a nation are too enthusiastic in celebrating other nations’ festivals, it indicates that the country is suffered from extremely serious cultural invasion.
If party members and government officials are not aware of this, it means that they are not politically sensitive and have lost their progressiveness.
The commentary references the history of the Eight-Nation Alliance, a coalition formed in response to the Boxer Rebellion in China between 1899 and 1901 when Chinese peasants rose up against foreign, colonial, Christian rule and culture.
It further argues that the birthday of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China, should be treated as China’s Christmas:
Translation Original Quote
The first Chairman of the Republic of China Mao Zedong had saved people from misery.
We should make his birthday Chinese Christmas.
Act and reject Western festivals.
But many on Weibo found these arguments illogical.
One commentator said:
Translation Original Quote
When Westerners celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, Chinese people are so proud and see the phenomena as the revival of Chinese traditional culture...
When Chinese people celebrate Western festivals, what's the point of labeling them as culture invasion?
Young people celebrate Western festivals for fun and joy.
The festivals can boost consumption, what’s wrong with that?
Some people try to draw connection between celebrating Christmas and the national humiliation that happened 160 years ago.
For what?
Social pressure, self-censorship
The flood of anti-Christmas comments on social media has generated pressure for some social media users to self-censor.
A Weibo user expressed frustration:
Translation Original Quote
Christmas is approaching.
In my friend circle, anti-Western festival camps and anti-anti Western festival camps are debating.
Whether one likes to celebrate or not is none of others’ business, why do people just have to force others to agree with their view?
Everyone standing on one side is too crowded.
For those of us who are in the middle, in order to create a balance, we have to stand on the other side.
School notice against the celebration of Western festivals on campus.
Pressure goes beyond social media platforms, extending to institutions such as schools and corporations.
Some Weibo users have shared school notices that were distributed to students.
One of the notices (right) refers to the "Suggestions" mandate and urges teachers and students to resist Western style celebrations.
It also demands students to spread anti-Western messages to friends and family members on Wechat and other mobile messaging applications.
One mother was surprised to find her child rejecting her offer of a Christmas gift. She wrote on Weibo:
Translation Original Quote
Mother: Baby, what do you want for Christmas gift?
Child: I will not celebrate Western festivals Christmas is not a Chinese people’s festival.
OK, you are definitely an obedient baby of the Party and the People.
However, high school and college students were more critical.
One student questioned school policy on Weibo:
Translation Original Quote
The school has banned Christmas decorations on campus and forbidden students to exchange gifts so as to campaign against Western festivals.
Are all these measures to enhance and promote Chinese culture or a sign of losing confidence on one’s own culture?
Some have chosen to celebrate the festival in secret. A Weibo user said:
Translation Original Quote
The company has forbidden the celebration of Western festivals. But the secretary in the personnel department has handed out a Christmas apple [common Christmas gift] to the staff members in secret.
Let’s wish for peace.
Another Weibo user expressed his view with a Christmas wish:
Translation Original Quote
Merry Christmas!
I love you god!
Santa Claus, pls give me a big big sock with freedom in it.
An all-female flight crew makes history in Mozambique
Mozambique's first all-female crew | Photo used with permission from Meck Antonio.
It is a historic day: that is how many Mozambicans regard December 14, 2018 when, for the first time in the country's civil aviation history, an airplane was operated solely by women.
The crew for flight TM112/3, which traveled between the capital, Maputo, and Manica — an air distance of 442 miles — was captain Admira António, co-pilot Elsa Balate, cabin chief Maria da Luz Aurélio, and flight attendant Débora Madeleine.
The women are members of MEX, an entity originally created as the Special Operations Department of LAM — Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique.
In 1995, it began operations as an independent airline, Mozambique Express.
A congratulatory Facebook status update posted by feminist activist Eliana Nzualo, has so far attracted nearly 450 comments, been shared more than 460 times, and garnered close to 2,000 reactions:
Translation Original Quote
A HISTORIC DAY – All-female crew
Congratulations MEX!
Congratulations crew!
Congratulations, Mozambique!
For more women in all sectors.
Social activist Mauro Brito added that women should be proud "when [they] are represented in various sectors":
Translation Original Quote
In aviation there are few women, very few, this is not only here but in the whole world.
I imagine the women who thought this profession was for men only, should feel proud.
Mozambique is not alone.
In August 2018, in a first for South Africa's national carrier SAA, an intercontinental flight with an all-female crew took to the skies to transport passengers from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Eight months earlier, in December 2017, Ethiopian Airlines operated its first ever flight staffed by an all-female crew.
From pilots to cabin crew, check-in staff to flight dispatchers, the flight — from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia to Lagos in Nigeria — was (wo)manned entirely by women.
Why are African governments criminalising online speech? Because they fear its power.

Africa’s landscape of online free speech and dissent is gradually, but consistently, being tightened.
In legal and economic terms, the cost of speaking out is rapidly rising across the continent.
While most governments are considered democratic in that they hold elections with multi-party candidates and profess participatory ideals, in practice, many operate much closer dictatorships — and they appear to be asserting more control over digital space with each passing day.
Cameroon, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Benin have in the recent past witnessed internet shutdowns, the imposition of taxes on blogging and social media use, and the arrest of journalists.
Media workers and citizens have been jailed on charges ranging from publishing “false information” to exposing state secrets to terrorism.
At the recent Forum of Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFA) held in Accra, Ghana, a group of panelists from various African countries all said they feared African governments were interested in controlling digital space to keep citizens in check.
Many countries have statutes and laws which guarantee the right to free expression.
In Nigeria, for example, the Freedom of Information Act grants citizens the right to demand information from any government agency.
Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution provides for freedom of the press and Section 39 maintains that "every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference..."
Yet, Nigeria has issued other laws that authorities use to deny these aforementioned rights.
Section 24 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act criminalises "anyone who spreads messages he knows to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent."
Making laws with ambiguous and subjective terms like "inconvenience" or "insult" calls for concern.
Governments and their agents often use this as a cover to suppress freedom of expression.
Who determines the definition of an insult?
Should public officials expect to develop a thick skin?
In many parts of the world, citizens have the right to criticise public officials.
Why don't Africans have the right to offend as an essential part of free expression?
In 2017 and 2016, Nigerian online journalists and bloggers Abubakar Sidiq Usman and Kemi Olunloyo were each booked on spurious charges of cyber-stalking in connection with journalistic investigations on the basis of the Cybercrime Act.
Don’t suffer in silence — keep talking
The very existence of these legal challenges tells citizens that their voices matter.
From Tanzania’s prohibition on spreading "false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate" information online to Uganda’s tax on social media that is intended to curb "gossip", the noise made on digital platforms scares oppressive regimes. In some cases, it may even lead to them to rescind their actions.
The experience of the Zone9 bloggers of Ethiopia provides a powerful example.
In 2014, nine Ethiopian writers were jailed and tortured over a collective blogging project in which they wrote about human rights violations by Ethiopia’s former government, daring to speak truth to power.
The state labeled the group "terrorists" for their online activity and incarcerated them for almost 18 months.
Zone9 members Mahlet (left) and Zelalem (right) rejoiced at the release of Befeqadu Hailu (second from left, in scarf) in October 2015.

Six members of the now liberated group made their premier international engagement in Ghana during FIFA conference: Atnaf Berhane, Befeqadu Hailu Techane, Zelalem Kibret, Natnael Feleke Aberra, and Abel Wabella were all in attendance.
Jomanex Kasaye, who had worked with the group prior to the arrests (but was not arrested) also attended.
Several members had collaborated with Global Voices to write and translate stories into the Amharic.
As members of the community, Global Voices campaigned and mobilised the global human rights community to speak out about their case from the very first night they were arrested.
After months of writing stories and promoting their case on Twitter, international condemnation of their arrest and imprisonment began to flow from governments and prominent human rights leaders, alongside hundreds of thousands of online supporters.
From the four-compass points of the world, a mighty cry arose demanding the Ethiopian government to free the Zone9 bloggers.
In their remarks at FIFA, the bloggers said that their membership in the Global Voices community was key to visibility during their time in prison.
In their panel session, they credited Global Voices’ campaign for keeping them alive.
Berhan Taye, the panel moderator, asked the group to recount their prison experiences.
As they spoke, the lights on the stage dimmed.
Their voices filled the room with a quiet power.
Abel Wabella, who ran Global Voices’ Amharic site, lost hearing in one ear due to the torture he endured after refusing to sign a false confession.
Atnaf Berhane recalled that one of his torture sessions lasted until 2 a.m. and then continued after he had a few hours of sleep.
One of the security agents who arrested Zelalem Kibret had once been Kibret's student at the university where he taught.
Jomanex Kasaye recounted the mental agony of leaving Ethiopia before his friends were arrested — the anguish of powerlessness — the unending suspense and fear that his friends would not make it out alive.

With modesty, the Zone9 bloggers said:
We are not strong or courageous people... we are only glad we inspired others.
Yet, the Zone9 bloggers redefined patriotism with both their words and actions.
It takes immense courage to love one's country even after suffering at its hands for speaking out.
Ugandan journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo, also in attendance at FIFA, shared an Igbo proverb popularised by Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe which says:
Since the hunter has learned to shoot without missing, Eneke the bird has also learnt to fly without perching.
In essence, he meant that in order to keep digital spaces free and safe, those involved in this struggle must devise new methods.
Activists on the front lines of free speech in sub-Saharan Africa and across the globe cannot afford to work in silos or go silent in frustration and defeat.
With our strength and unity, online spaces will remain free to deepen democracy through vibrant dissent.
The untold tragedy of 28 Mauritanian soldiers executed on Independence Day
Screenshot of the 28 soldiers executed on Independence day – Video posted by Ibrahima Sow.
On November 28, 1990, 28 men in Inal, Mauritania, were hanged by fellow soldiers in a prison the middle of the night, meticulously selected one by one to be killed, after being accused of plotting a coup against the government.
The date, which also marks Mauritania's independence from France in 1960, continues to haunt some Mauritanians who seek justice for the brutal killings of these 28 men, all of whom were black.
The West African nation of Mauritania is a mix of Arab-Berber and black Africans and human rights groups say black Africans have long suffered discrimination and exploitation.
The president of the Inal-France Committee, Youba Dianka, explains:
Translation Original Quote
I want to make it clear that Inal is just an example; there were many ‘Inals’ in Mauritania.
Horrific events happened in Azlatt, Sory Malé, Wothie, Walata, Jreida and in the valley.
Inside the military compound in Inal and its surroundings, soldiers were quartered, buried alive, shot, and hung in celebration of the country's independence in 1990.
On Independence Day this year, Mauritanians paid more attention to the nomination of their national football team to the Africa Cup of Nations (CAF) finals than they did to the forgotten “soldiers [who] lay in solitude in anonymous pits ...
still waiting for a decent burial,” writes Kaaw Elimane Bilbassi Touré, news editor of the Mauritanian news site Le Flambeau.
Kiné-Fatim Diop, campaign director for Western Africa at Amnesty International, remarked this year on the contradictions between what should be a celebratory day and what most victims’ families actually feel:
Translation Original Quote
Each year, while the officials celebrate the ascension to sovereignty with joy, the victims’ families cry and protest in sadness for justice and reparations.
The authorities are only trying to bury this hideous side of independence, just like when they secretly voted an amnesty law in 1993 affirming the state's amnesia concerning the soldiers’ killings 30 years ago.
The Forum Against Impunity and Injustice in Mauritania expressed sorrow over the tragedy of two brothers in particular who were hanged on that tragic night:
Translation Original Quote
Absolutely, a curse fell on the 28 soldiers that night. Like the two brothers, Diallo Oumar Demba and his brother Diallo Ibrahima, who were hanged wearing consecutive numbers written on them with a pen.
What makes this sadder is having to witness your older brother's death.
The executioners did their work with accuracy, and were actually not stopping at the hanging part, but also dragging the dead and sitting on their corpses.
Survivors speak out
Testimonies from survivors continue to pour in after 30 years.
Mamadou Sy was a squadron commander in the Mauritanian army, then a deputy commander and finally a base commander before he was arrested that night.
In his book “Hell in Inal“, published in 2000, he describes the torture he suffered, when military commanders blindfolded him, tied him up, and threw him in dirty, stinking water.
Another soldier who survived that dreadful night managed to go to France for treatment after his time in prison with the help of the Christian Association Against Torture (ACAT in French).
He testifies on the condition of anonymity on the racism he experienced in his 24 years of military service:
Translation Original Quote
As far as I can remember, since I have started to understand, I have always noticed that black people never had any rights, and that the white Mauritanians were privileged.
Here, out of twenty ministers in the government, only a quarter are black and in the army, there is only one black person out of ten officers.
During an internship, if a white Mauritanian wouldn't perform well, they would still win over any other black person. And don't even dare protesting ...
He describes the methods of torture he and other soldiers experienced:
Translation Original Quote
For example, they dug holes in the sand, buried us up to the neck, with the head fixed, our naked face turned toward the sun.
If we ever tried to close our eyes, the guards would throw sand. And then put the blindfolds back on.
Maimouna Alpha Sy, general secretary of the Widow and Humanitarian Issues Association, was once married to Ba Baïdy Alassane, a former customs controller.
Alpha Sy says her late husband was among the victims killed in 1990.
Translation Original Quote
We spent three months and ten days looking for my husband, but in vain ...
Customs told us he died from a cardiac arrest, which is not true.
Witnesses were arrested, tied and tortured with him.
He was killed in front of them.
‘Never again’
This year on November 28, Mauritanian immigrants protested in front of the Mauritanian embassy in Paris, France, against the state's disregard for this tragic episode.
Kardiata Malick Diallo, a deputy, gave a remarkable speech at the Mauritanian parliament to prevent people from forgetting, accusing the current prime minister of protecting the perpetrators, who still hold high offices in the state while victims rights’ have not been properly addressed:
Translation Original Quote
Even if you are not directly responsible for the action that definitely stained every November 28, you still however were responsible for finding an adequate solution for the victims’ rights to the truth and justice ...
Great nations and great people never try to erase a dark episode out of their history but instead they show it to the world for everyone to remember and say "NEVER AGAIN".
Mister prime minister, your power has preferred policies of marginalization and exclusion.
As of October 2018, out of 24 ministerial functions, only five are occupied by black or mixed people, who represent up to 70 percent of society.
The majority of the population are still under-represented among the elected representatives, members of the security forces, officials and local administrators.
Mauritania is the last country in the world to officially abolish slavery in 1981 but it wasn't enforced until 2007 and an estimated 20 percent still live in some form of enslaved servitude, most of whom are black or mixed.
Because this historic racism persists in present-day Mauritania, justice for the survivors and their families remains out of reach.
100 days for Alaa: Family of Egyptian activist counts the days until his release from prison
Alaa Abd El Fattah, photo by Nariman El-Mofty.
After spending five years in prison, the Egyptian blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is scheduled to be released from prison on March 17, 2019.
On December 8, his family launched a campaign — "100 days for Alaa" — to ensure his prison term ends on time.
The March release date does not mark the end of Alaa's time served, but rather a transition to the final phase of his sentence.
After his release, Alaa will be made to spend every night in his local police station for an additional five years.
He will be under police surveillance throughout this period.
Alaa was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November 2013.
More than one year later, in February 2015, he was finally tried and sentenced to five years in prison for "organising" a protest under a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorised demonstrations.
While he did take part in a protest against military trials for civilians on 26 November 2013, Alaa had no role in organising it.
His sentence was confirmed by Egypt’s Court of Cassation in November 2017.
Omar Robert Hamilton, a cousin of Alaa, outlined the goals of the campaign on Twitter:
To re-focus local and international attention on his case to ensure that Alaa is actually released on March 17th.
To enter the concept of المراقبة (‘surveillance’ or ‘parole’) into the public consciousness.
After release, Alaa is still sentenced to spend every night in his local police station for "five years".
We need to lay the groundwork for pressure against this.
Alaa has been jailed or investigated under every Egyptian head of state who has served during his lifetime.
In 2006, he was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest.
In 2011, he spent two months in prison, missing the birth of his first child, Khaled.
In 2013, he was arrested and detained for 115 days without trial.
Alaa has long worked on technology and political activism projects with his wife, Manal Hassan.
He comes from a family of prominent human rights advocates, including human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El Islam, Alaa's father, who was jailed multiple times under the regime of Hosni Mubarak.
Abd El Fattah’s sisters, Mona and Sanaa Seif, are also human rights defenders who have long campaigned against the military trials of civilians in the country.
In 2016, Sanaa served a six-month jail sentence for insulting a public official.
Alaa's ordeal is similar to many other Egyptians who are behind bars because of their activism.
There are as many as 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt, human rights groups say.
Those arrested on politically-motivated charges in Egypt are often subjected to enforced disappearances, torture, prolonged pre-trial detention and solitary confinement.
Joining the #FreeAlaa campaign
In a letter to the attendees of RightsCon, a digital rights conference held in Toronto in May 2018, Alaa urged supporters to ”fix [their] own democracies”.
This has always been my answer to the question "how can we help?" I still believe [fixing democracy] is the only possible answer.
Not only is where you live, work, vote, pay tax and organize the place where you have more influence, but a setback for human rights in a place where democracy has deep roots is certain to be used as an excuse for even worse violations in societies where rights are more fragile.
I trust recent events made it evident that there is much that needs fixing.
I look forward to being inspired by how you go about fixing it.
Those looking to join the "100 days for Alaa" campaign are encouraged to send "essays, photos or acts of solidarity" that will be republished on the campaign's website:
This is an open-source campaign – we'll be putting out some new ideas, but need new thoughts and new energy coming in too.
So get thinking with us!
The hashtag, as always, is #FreeAlaa – please join us in preparing the ground for Alaa's release.
First transgender pride march hopes to shatter stereotypes in Pakistan

To assert their rights and demand implementation of the law, a Transgender Pride March took place in Lahore, Pakistan, on 29 December 2018.
For the first time in the country's history, Transgender people dared to step out of their seclusion and demanded that the Government implement The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, of May 24, 2018.
Transgender Pride march takes place in Pakistan
Trans people in Pakistan staged the country's first Transgender Pride march.
The Constitution of Pakistan says that "No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law," which is covered under the Fundamental Rights of citizens.
However, Transgender persons have a different story to tell when it comes to their rights and life; they have faced torture, rape, been burnt alive, beheaded and even shot dead, yet the state did not help them despite the passing of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act by the Government in March 2018.
Jannat Ali, nicknamed Lahore's Trans Diva, is the founder of Track Transgender and Program Director of Sathi Foundation which organized the Pride March.
Other transgender people and non-transgender supportive members also played their role in the execution of the march and its success.
Sathi Foundation is a transgender-led organization working for the welfare of the transgender community in Pakistan.

The march was attended by nearly 250 transgender people from all provinces of Pakistan.
Prominent among them were Kami Sid, Bebo from Sindh, Nadra from KPK, Anmol from Sahiwal District, Nayab from Okara, Sunaina Khan (Classical Dancer), Naghma & Lucky (Coke Studio Singers), Laila Naz and Neeli Rana.
The event started with a Press Conference at the Lahore Press Club where the demands of the community were presented; after which they marched to Al Hamra Cultural Complex on the Mall dancing and singing songs on the way, where they dispersed after food.
Even though the press conference was held in the Lahore Press Club the Pride March was not covered by mainstream media.
Although organizers invited officials, like Punjab MNA Saadia Sohail from Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf, government officials didn't attend the event.
The march did generate some attention on social media where people appreciated the parade while some questioned the reason for its non-coverage by mainstream media.
According to organizer Jannat Ali:
The aim was to show positive and progressive image of Pakistan and how the country is slowly accepting us and we are gaining more space in the society.
Pakistan is not only about terrorism and a conservative society there is more to us.
We promoted our march along with our KhawajaSara (transgender) culture and traditions it was not the same type of march as it is held in US.
The march also emphasized a positive and progressive image of the transgender community; it also called attention to the discrimination and violence.
Due to limited options in mainstream jobs, transgender people are forced to turn to the sex trade to earn a living.
Due to unsafe sex practices, many have HIV and AIDS.
The police and doctors also need to be sensitized as they are often making life difficult for Transgender people who reach out for help or medical assistance.
Despite the legislation, transgender people continue to face extreme hostility.
Since 2015, at least 500 transgender people have been killed in Pakistan, while Jannat Ali says that more than 60 transgender individuals have been killed in the last year alone.
Asad Zaidi tweeted about the general impression of Pakistanis towards the transgender community:
In a talk at TEDxLahore in 2017, Jannat Ali shared her painful journey about being a transgender person in Pakistan after coming out to not just her family but to society at large as well.
The Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act 2018 passed by majority votes in the National Assembly ensured that the community could obtain a driver's license, passport, have the right to get their gender changed in National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) records, stopping of harassment, access to educational, employment in trade and health services without discrimination.
It also mentions that safe houses for transgender people, medical and educational facilities and psychological counseling will be provided to them by the government.
They will be entitled to inherit property and will also have the right to vote in elections.

Pakistan is slowly starting to make strides when it comes to transgender visibility.
A few Transgender people contested the General Elections 2018 for National and Provincial Assembly seats for the first time.
A local TV channel hired its first transgender anchor; Coke studio, a music program, featured two transgender people in an episode.
While things are changing for the transgender community and they are slowly being accepted, the process is slow.
However, many are optimistic that things will soon change for the better and these people will get their place in society with the rights and privileges of citizens equal in the eyes of society and the law.
‘Stop killing women’ — a new campaign against domestic violence in Angola
Manifestação em Luanda: #Paremdematarasmulheres | foto Simão Hossi
Demonstration in Luanda, Angola, using the hashtag #Paremdematarasmulheres in Portuguese, or ‘stop killing women’, Photo by Simão Hossi, used with permission.
When 26-year-old lawyer Carolina Joaquim de Sousa da Silva was found dead in her home on December 3, 2018, her husband confessed to the crime and was detained by Angola's criminal investigation department known as SIC.
In the same week, another murder of a woman was reported by Angola Public Television who said the young woman was allegedly stabbed by her ex-boyfriend.
These cases of violent crime have put many Angolan women on guard and led to a new campaign against domestic violence called "Stop Killing Women," organized by Association Ondjango, a feminist nongovernmental organization.
Using Facebook as their main mobilizing tool, their objective is to raise awareness about crimes against women in Angola:
Translation Original Quote
These have been difficult days.
In truth, for us women, many days are difficult and painful because we still live in a context where, in one way or another, all types of violence against us are always excused.
And in recent days, in particular, it was even more painful for having to deal with the reactions which came after the case of Carolina...
Violence against women is real, it really is.
It is not something in the heads of feminists, it is not an invention or empty speech: IT IS REAL!
Carolina, unfortunately, only adds to the statistics, there were many other cases before her which came to public attention and there are thousands of other cases that do not come to public attention.
It is a problem which is right there at the doorstep, before our eyes.
And it is a problem that supposes relations between one or another couple — it is a structural problem.
There is a structure that dictates and relegates women to roles of subordination which turns them into potential targets of violence of all kinds and at all levels.
This structure of masculine supremacy which hangs over us and which many deny the existence of — and that is not invisible — does this: it mutilates and destroys the lives of women and KILLS!
We, individual women, and also as a collective, will continue to shout "stop killing us" and "hurting our being".
We want laws that protect us and are really applicable, we want public policies that bring respect of our humanity to debates and institutions.
We want a society where we are not afraid of going out in the street!
We will continue demanding a society where we have our freedom of being, of feeling, of walking and thinking how we want.
We will continue to demand a society where we can live in security.
Meanwhile, this campaign sparked opposing reactions from some men who found justifications for the wave of violence against women.
Their campaign is called "Stop Betraying Us" and believe that betrayal is a valid reason for domestic violence against women.
Though their movement has not gained much traction, Angolan rapper Gil Slows Allen Russel even said:
Translation Original Quote
Stop betraying others, please no more cuckolds.
It is a loud cry, women if you no longer love us ask for a divorce before betraying us, go away.
Sociologist Mbangula Kemba criticized this point of view, asserting that conjugal problems must not be resolved with violence.
Angola approved a domestic violence law known as 25/11 in 2011 which criminalizes all acts of domestic violence as a public crime.
However, this law has insufficiently light sentences, which vary from two to eight years.
Sizaltina Cutaia, an activist and feminist in Angola well-known for working on women’s rights, called for a better application of the law on social media:
Translation Original Quote
It is not enough to increase sentences, Mrs. vice president of the MPLA [People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola], it is necessary that the state creates structural conditions to combat violence — the commitments taken in 2007 through the ratification of the protocol of Maputo need to be implemented.
As well as this, it is necessary to create structures to attend to the victims and enact complementary legislation that guarantees de facto realization of women’s rights.
This includes all the legislation around women’s sexual and reproductive rights.
It is no use making speeches against domestic violence and afterward supporting policies that authorize inspectors and police officers to assault women daily in the streets, it’s contradictory!
It is no use making speeches against domestic violence and supporting a state budget which does not safeguard social services, the underfinancing of which we all know negatively impacts the lives of women.
It is necessary to give sense to the speeches with concrete actions.
Put your money where your mouth is.
# stop killing women
Feminist Cecília Kitombé reacted to those who continue to encourage violent relationships:
Translation Original Quote
Some of those who are … asserting that it is too much [to speak out against domestic violence], are the same who advise daughters, sisters, and cousins to stay in abusive relationships, under the pretext that in the conversation of husband and wife you cannot interfere, and others tell you to continue, life in a couple is just like that...
There are also those who think that women can do everything, but must never forget their "role"
Stop killing us!!!
How preserving folktales and legends help raise environment awareness in the Mekong
The Mekong Basin. Photo from the website of The People's Stories project.

In 2014, several indigenous communities in the Mekong started recording their stories and legends with the help of a group of researchers who are exploring how these narratives can help exposing the destructive impact of large-scale projects in the region.
The Mekong is one of Asia’s great river systems which flows through six countries: China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
It is rich in biodiversity and a vital source of livelihood for millions of farmers and fisherfolk.
In recent years, several large-scale projects such as hydropower dams have displaced residents while threatening the river basin's ecosystem.
Despite protests, the construction of dams has continued, especially in Laos and Thailand.
In partnership with Mekong Watch, a Japan-based group advocating sustainable development in the region, several community elders in the Mekong began recording some of their stories and legends in 2014 that revolve around nature.
Mekong Watch believes that these stories "have played an important role in protecting nature by avoiding the over-exploitation of natural resources."
Mekong Watch asserts that part of the commons that need to be protected are not just natural resources but also "intangible heritages" that can be shared and accessed by the local community.
Toshiyuki Doi, senior adviser of Mekong watch, adds:
People’s stories should be regarded, recognized, and respected as Mekong’s commons, especially these days when they are losing their place in local communities to more modern media, and are not passed on to next generations.
Areas in the Mekong where researchers conducted fieldwork. 1. Kmhmu’ in northern and central Laos; 2. Siphandon in southern Laos; 3. Akha in northern Thailand; 4. Thai So and Isan in northeastern Thailand; 5. Bunong in northeastern Cambodia.
Used with permission.
The group was able to collect a total of 102 stories in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.
Stories were recorded, transcribed, and translated into the national languages of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before an English version was made.
Mekong Watch published these stories as pamphlets in both printed and digital formats, and used them during environment workshops they conducted at the communities.
Since late 2016, we have used people’s stories to provide environmental education to children in rural Laos and Thailand.
We have hosted workshops in schools and local communities to guide children, and sometimes adults, to collect stories from elderly people, learn from the stories, and turn them into reading materials.
An example of a workshop involves the retelling of the story of "The Owl and the Deer" from Kmhmu’ people in central and northern Laos.
The story is about an owl who lost his ability to see during the day after cheating a deer.
During a workshop, young participants are asked:
"What kinds of animals appear in the story?",
"Can you see these animals in your village?", and
"If there are fewer of these animals in your village than before, why do you think this has happened?"
After this, participants are encouraged to connect the story to the deterioration of the environment in their communities.
In Champasak Province, south Laos, the legend of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin and the Sida bird is used to highlight how a dam project is disrupting the seasonal migration of Mekong River fisheries.
Another story also from southern Laos is instructive on the value of resource management:
The story about the Rhino Head was recorded on November 16, 2014, at the Songkram River bank in northeast Thailand.
The narrator was Mun Kimprasert, aged 68, photo by Mekong Watch, used with permission.
Once, a soldier stepped into a spirit forest.
He discovered a lot of tobacco leaves there and collected them.
However, when trying to leave the forest, he could not find an exit.
It was because he took more tobacco leaves than he could possibly consume for himself.
No matter how hard he searched, he could not find a way.
Realizing what might have been the problem, he finally decided to return the tobacco leaves to the forest.
The moment he dropped them on the ground, he was able to see an exit in front of him.
In northern Thailand, a story by the Akha people about the origin of the swing teaches self-sacrifice through a heroic episode of a brother and a sister who put the world in order.
In northeast Thailand, a folktale about Ta Sorn narrated by Tongsin Tanakanya promotes unity among neighbors in a farming community.
Another story recalls how the hunting of a rhinoceros led to the formation of salt trading in this part of the country.
In Bunong, located in northeast Cambodia, there are stories about rituals to fix bad marriages and planting and harvest ceremonies narrated by Khoeuk Keosineam.
There is also the legend of the elephant as retold by Chhot Pich which reveals how villagers who once poisoned a river were punished by the gods and turned into elephants.
It explains why elephants were comfortable living with humans but, after several generations, they forgot their origins and went to live in the forest.
Hea Phoeun from the Laoka Village, Senmonorom, Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia shares a village ritual on how to fix an unfit marriage.
Photo by Mekong Watch, used with permission.
For Mekong Watch and the threatened communities in the region, preserving these stories is integral in the campaign to resist projects that would displace thousands of people living in the Mekong:
These stories can help form their identity as a community member and identify with the environment.
By means of stories, the communities search for ways to accommodate and/or resist changes that are taking place in the Mekong river basin.
Meet Nigeria's presidential candidates of 2019
The 2019 Nigerian presidential candidates [Collage by Nwachukwu Egbunike].
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, will hold presidential elections on February 16, 2019.
Although there are 73 presidential candidates, the race for Aso Rock — the seat of Nigeria's presidency — will be between two major contenders and candidates from the so-called "third force", a group of hopefuls who are relatively new to Nigerian politics.
Muhammad Buhari, president of Nigeria. Creative Commons.
The two major Nigerian parties, All Progressive Congress and Peoples Democratic Party, will, of course, be fielding their candidates:
Muhammadu Buhari
The incumbent candidate of the All Progressive Congress, Buhari won the 2011 presidential election after defeating former president Goodluck Jonathan.
Buhari's ascendance to power was based on his integrity and perceived ability to curb corruption and the Boko Haram militancy.
However, under his watch, Nigeria has witnessed continued insecurity with pastoral conflicts between herders and farmers as herders from the north move further south in search of arable lands.
Also, human rights have taken a nose drive in his administration, with impunity and corruption at the highest levels of government.
Atiku Abubakar [Image from Campaign Organisation Website].
Atiku Abubakar
Abubakar is the former vice president and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.
He has tried in the past to win presidential elections but has not been successful.
However, his campaign received a major boost with the reconciliation with his boss, former President Olusegun Obasanjo — who had described Buhari's administration as a failed government.
As vice president, Abubakar oversaw the privatization and sale of hundreds of loss-making and poorly managed public enterprises.
A few other presidential hopefuls to watch are:
Oby Ezekwesili [Image released by campaign organizers as media resource]
Obiageli [Oby] Ezekwesili
Ezekwesili, the only major female candidate in this year's race, served as the minister of solid minerals and later education during the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 to 2007.
She was also former vice president of the Africa division of the World Bank from May 2007 to May 2012.
Ezekwesili has been at the forefront of the call to rescue about 200 school girls who were abducted by the Boko Haram militant Islamic group in 2014.
She is a co-founder of the #BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) Movement.
She is also the presidential flag-bearer of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria.
Kingsley Moghalu [Image from campaign website].
Kingsley Moghalu
Moghalu is a professor of international business and public policy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, USA.
Moghalu had previously worked in the United Nations from 1992 to 2008.
He was deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2014, where "he led extensive reforms in the Nigerian banking system after the global financial crisis."
He is the candidate of the Young Progressive Party.
Omoyele Sowore [Screen shot from CNBCAfrica interview, Dec 13, 2018].
Omoyole Sowore
Sowore is the founder and publisher of SaharaReporters (SR), an investigative online newspaper.
SR has been described as Africa's Wikileaks.
This human rights activist is running under the banner of African Action Congress.
The race is on for Nigeria's future
Buhari and Abubakar are the major contenders in this race.
Both men have been constants in the political arena in Nigeria.
On the other hand, Ezekwesili, Moghalu, Sowore, the "third force", are a group making their first entry into the partisan political space.
Buhari will be running on the gains of his administration over the past three years and must contend with the fact that Nigeria was recently ranked as the poverty capital of the world.
The Punch newspaper described Buhari’s "parochial appointments" as "unprecedented" and has left the country deeply divided.
His fight against corruption appears selective and punitive.
The recent move to try the Chief Justice of the Federation — so close to the presidential election — was described by the Nigerian Bar Association as "a pattern of consistent assault on the heads of the two independent arms of government" by the Buhari administration.
Abubakar, on the other hand, is riding on the "gains" of "multiple lucrative business interests".
However, he has an uphill task considering the power of incumbency of his major opponent.
Whoever wins the 2019 elections will face enormous challenges like the strengthening the economy, internal security, restructuring power and power devolution, and ethnoreligious politics.
Singled out for search at a Serbian supermarket, Roma opera superstar accuses the store of racism

Serbian social networks were set ablaze after opera singer and local superstar Nataša Tasić Knežević, who is of Roma origin, accused a supermarket in the city of Novi Sad of racial profiling on a live broadcast on Facebook.
In the video, broadcast on December 29 right after the incident, Ms. Tasić Knežević explained that as she exited the Maxi supermarket store along with several other shoppers, the anti-theft sensor beeped.
While everyone else was allowed to leave, the store's security officers told her to stay and proceeded to search her in public while onlookers heckled her.
In her backpack, they only found sheet music, books, and a wallet.
In the first days of January 2019, the video suddenly vanished from the platform along with Ms. Knežević's profile.
Although she hasn't publicly explained what happened, many speculate that she has removed them herself to de-escalate the turmoil.
In just a few days, her video amassed over 60 thousand views, was shared around 350 times and received around 700 reactions.
Independent news portal Buka was the first to report the incident, followed by other Balkan media.
Ms. Tasić Knežević is a soprano at the Serbian National Theatre, located in Novi Sad, the country's second largest city.
Previously, she worked in the Belgrade theater Atelje 212.
She is also a choir performer and a soloist of popular music and often sings of her own Roma heritage.
In the video, Ms Knežević says the store manager apologized to her after she complained about the maltreatment, but that she was still hurt by the mob's harassment.
She says one older man shouted that they "should pack that garbage out", meaning that employees should throw her out of the store, supposedly for her being Roma.
"It is known who likes to steal around here!" is a sentence from the movie "Who's Singin’ Over There?" about events taking place on 5 April 1941.
77 years later this [discriminatory stereotype] is not rooted out from our mentality.
The company [owning Maxi markets] is Dutch-Belgian but the employees are our people! For shame!
Support for the wonderful woman and artist @NatasaTasicKnez.
"Who's Singin’ Over There?" is a 1980s Yugoslavian movie that has achieved cult status in the Balkans.
In the story, two Roma musicians are wrongfully accused of theft and barely manage to escape alive from a lynching attempt.
The parent company of Maxi supermarkets, Delez Srbija, issued an official apology on the same day.
It stated that it "believes that this would remain an isolated incident of inappropriate individual reaction and that there won't be similar situations in the future".
The company has added that it will conduct formal training of their employees on appropriate conduct upon suspicion of theft.
The next day, Miloš Nikolić, the Director of Office for Roma Inclusion of Novi Sad, officially condemned the incident.
He said: All available research shows that Roma men and women are the most discriminated groups in our country.
We have to work together to change it!
On December 31, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Gender Equality Coordination Body, Zorana Mihajlović, also decried the behavior of Maxi store employees as “scandalous and for condemnation.
She did not announce any concrete measures to address the broader issue of discrimination against people of Roma descent in Serbia.
While Ms. Knežević seems to have removed her profile from Facebook, possibly to de-escalate the turmoil, she has retained her Twitter profile.
On New Year's Eve, she posted a short message referring to the incident.
Dear friends, a very unpleasant situation took place few days ago, but I hope all such situations will remain in 2018 and that similar event won't occur any more.
Let us all be human beings, that is the only good thing on this world. <3
The beef between two Trinidad and Tobago soca stars is a nod to age-old musical traditions

Private grouses have a funny way of becoming public feuds — especially in the music industry.
From high-profile beefs like the ones between Kanye West and Taylor Swift and Jamaica's Mavado and Vybz Kartel, to the more local but equally infamous 2004 fight between Trinidadian soca stars Destra and Denise Belfon, celebrity quarrels often end up bringing attention to the artists and drawing new audiences to their music.
Now, thanks to a burgeoning battle between Trinidad and Tobago entertainers Machel Montano and Neil “Iwer” George, soca music officially has its first spat of 2019.
Trinidad and Tobago's annual Carnival celebrations take place this year on March 4 and 5, and the lead up is peak time for soca music.
Popular soca performers like Montano and George are booked for Carnival events months in advance.
They're releasing new music in a bid to win the coveted Road March title, which offers a substantial monetary prize to the artist whose song plays the most during Carnival.

Soca music lovers first noticed tension between the two musicians when George released his first song of 2019, "Road March Bacchanal 2".
The song's lyrics makes it clear that George holds a grudge after losing the 2018 Road March battle to Montano.
His composition, "Savannah", was a strong contender, but Montano had teamed up with soca veteran Superblue to release "Soca Kingdom", which copped the coveted 2018 Road March title.
"Soca Kingdom" was played 336 times, and "Savannah" 140.
Bringing his personal disappointment into the public domain, George's lyrics accused the "soca mafia" — ostensibly a group of deejays and radio station owners — of conspiring to play "Soca Kingdom" at the all judging points.
He sings:
On the stage was a next set of drama, the DJs and them playing "Savannah"
But when the mafia come, they switching from "Savannah" to ‘Kingdom’
They join forces to win the big fight... this year you have to team up with Jesus Christ
In another version of the song, George accuses Montano of "bad talking" him, and belittles the honorary doctorate Montano recently received from the University of Trinidad and Tobago for his contribution to soca music.
Soon after George’s song was released, Montano responded with "Dr. Mashup", in which he directly addressed allegations of rigging the Road March contest:
That was not the end of it: at a new Carnival party, "Hydrate", on January 13, both artists performed. George included his new verse and Montano supposedly had the last word:
After their performances, Montano’s manager, Anthony Chow Lin On, posted a photo to Instagram in which he comically holds the two apart:
The post left fans to wonder if the feud was real or simply a publicity stunt:
Stunt or not, many social media users following the feud have pointed out that this type of lyrical sparring (known as a "sound clash") is not new; in fact, it is intricately woven into the origins of calypso music, and its modern-day hybrid, soca.
In a recent interview, George himself addressed the fact that he was just "documenting the history" as he "always does", following the path of legendary calypsonians who did the same.
While calypso music is well known for its social and political commentary, an early form of the music involved verbal dueling similar to the war of words taking place between George and Montano.
Calypso tents, where calypsonians perform during the Carnival season, were hugely popular for their "extempo wars", live contests in which singers would improvise lyrics on the spot mocking each other, or on a specific theme.
The banter between the performers is locally referred to as "picong".
Such performances are typically interactive, with audiences echoing one of several refrains, the most common of which is "Santimanitay!", a derivative of the French phrase “sans humanité”, or “without pity”.
But audiences have rarely witnessed a back-and-forth like this in recorded soca music.
And real or not, the George/Montano feud has listeners as engaged as any extempo wars audience, both at Carnival events and online.
George and Montano will, very likely, both in the running for the 2019 Road March title and at the very least, the added drama makes for good entertainment and more music.
Soca lovers could ask for nothing more.
The Spiny Babbler, Nepal's only endemic bird, fascinates ornithologists and bird lovers alike

Although more than 800 bird species are found in Nepal, the Spiny Babbler (Turdoides nipalensis) is the only bird that is endemic to the country.
The greyish-brown bird, called Kaande Bhyakur in Nepali, lives in dense scrub and can be spotted more easily at elevations ranging from 500 meters to 2135 meters.
Although the Spiny Babbler has been fascinating ornithologists the world around for years, environmental degradation is threatening this unique, much-loved bird.
The book The Status of Nepal’s Birds: The National Red List Series states:
It seeks insects almost entirely on the ground among low bushes, appearing only occasionally.
Spiny Babbler mounts branches of bushes or small trees to sing, bill pointed upward and tail down. It is a good mimic, with squeaks, chuckles and chirps.
It is most easily located by its song and occasionally sings as late as September and October. The species is subject to seasonal altitudinal movements.
The Spiny Babbler, found only in Nepal, has fascinated ornithologists and bird lovers from around the world. Don Messerschmidt writes about ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley’s account of the bird in his book Search for the Spiny Babbler:
It was a species that had defied scientists for years, since 1843 or 1844.
At that time Brian Hodgson’s Nepali collectors working for him in the unknown vastnesses of Nepal had secured several specimens, he writes.
The Spiny Babbler had remained a mystery ever since, one of the five species of Indian birds, which, along with the Mountain Quail, had apparently vanished from the face of the earth.
But not quite, for if my guess was right, here it was hopping about large as life on the wooded slopes above Rekcha.
Likewise, former-American ambassador to Nepal Scott DeLisi spent years trying to spot and photograph this bird.
The bird is threatened by the clearance of scrub for agriculture and expansion of urban areas.
Outside protected areas, it is sometimes threatened by hunting, and the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley have seen a decline in Spiny Babbler numbers.
However, the same habitat loss that is destroying the Spiny Babbler's habitat in some areas might actually be creating more in others.
As the forest continues to thin due to deforestation throughout the country, the scrub-dominated habitat that they call home is being created in its wake.
But only time will tell what is in store for the population of Nepal's only endemic bird.
Nigeria's retired military generals battle for influence in 2019 presidential elections
Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria.
As Nigeria prepares for another presidential election in February, retired military generals turned politicians are key to understanding Nigeria's political space.
Nigeria has been ruled by either former generals or those who have their support since 1999 when democratic governance returned.
The recent public feud between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari — both retired military dictators — has a great impact on next month's elections.
In a rare open letter to Buhari, Obasanjo has accused him of plans to rig the 2019 elections. He wrote:
Democracy becomes a sham if elections are carried out by people who should be impartial and neutral umpires, but who show no integrity, acting with blatant partiality, duplicity and imbecility.
Obasanjo insisted that Buhari would not deliver "free, fair, credible and peaceful elections" and warned that what "is happening under Buhari’s watch can be likened to what we witnessed under Gen. Sani Abacha.
In 1998, Sani Abacha, a military dictator, had called for general elections but it became obvious that Abacha had no intention of handing power over to civilians.
The five political parties at the time endorsed Abacha as their sole presidential candidate.
Now deceased, Abacha became infamous for his repression of human rights and corruption.
Obasanjo alleged that Buhari was towing the "same path" as Abacha "in mad desperation".
Shehu Garba, the media assistant to President Buhari, dismissed Obasanjo's letter:
The elections starting in February will be free and fair as promised the nation and the international community by President Buhari.
Obasanjo, the letter writer?
Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state (1976-1979) and later Nigeria’s democratically elected president (1999-2007), has consistently criticized successive governments in Nigeria.
Last year, Obasanjo had advised Buhari not to seek re-election as president but to "consider a deserved rest at this point in time and at this age".
This advice caused ripples in Nigeria because Obasanjo was a strong supporter of the Buhari’s candidacy during the 2015 presidential elections.
Prior, Obasanjo had scolded Goodluck Jonathan in a public letter written in 2013, Obasanjo accused Jonathan of driving the country to the precipice and allowing deceit, corruption and mutual distrust to tear at the fabric of the nation.
Ironically, Obasanjo had also supported Jonathan's election in 2011. And in 2007, he promoted the election of Jonathan Goodluck's predecessor, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.
However, Obasanjo went against Yar’Adua when the latter became sick and did not hand properly hand over power to Jonathan, his then deputy.

Retired generals never rest in Nigeria
Nigeria’s political landscape is held by retired generals or their cronies. Obasanjo, for instance, has been instrumental in the emergence of Nigerian presidents from 2007 to 2015.
However, unlike civilians – Yar’Adua and Jonathan – who he promoted and also criticized, Buhari is somewhat different.
Although Obasanjo supported Buhari’s election in 2015, he cannot fully take the praise alone.
This is because Buhari’s ascendance to power was made possible by his allegiance with Bola Tinubu’s defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).
Buhari’s Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) later merged with ACN, in February 2013, to form the All Progressive Congress (APC) .
In addition, Buhari a former military head of state (1983-1985) is a member of the ‘club’ of retired generals who have dominated Nigeria’s political space.
Therefore, as harsh as Obasanjo’s reprimand might sound, a lot depends on the dynamics of the power block to which they both belong.
Obasanjo is not alone, however, in his criticism of Buhari.
Theophilus Danjuma, a retired general, had in March last year accused "the Nigerian armed forces of aiding the ongoing killings in Nigeria".
Danjuma, a former chief of army staff and later minister of defense, chastised the military for taking sides in the pastoral/farmer crisis in the country, but especially in his home state of Taraba.
Similarly, Danjuma recently raised an alarm about plans to use “the police and soldiers” to manipulate the 2019 elections.
Similarly, in February last year, former military head of state Ibrahim Babangida publicly advised President Buhari not to stand for re-election, arguing that 21st century Nigeria needs to tap younger generations.
He believes that there "comes a time in the life of a nation when personal ambition should not override national interest".
But it may be a while before Nigeria gets a civilian president who has no links or backing from the retired generals "club".
An owl refuses to leave Tanzanian parliament. What does it all mean?

On January 29, when the Tanzanian parliament (Bunge) assembled in Dodoma for its first session of 2019, an owl flew into the building, perched on the ceiling and observed the assembly from above.
The incident drew national attention and provoked questions from social media users and newspapers.
What could the presence of an owl in parliament mean?
The owl has been spotted twice inside the halls of parliament in the city of Dodoma. What does it seem to signal?
"Bad omen?" the regional weekly, The East African, proposed.
The British blogger and media analyst, Ben Taylor, went further:

Tanzanian cartoonist, Samuel Mwamkinga (Joune), later illustrated the incident with a reference to the British term "a group of owls" based on the Greek perception that owls are wise (illustration used with permission).
The owl is, however, seen as an omen of death and misfortune in Tanzania.
And — the owl was determined to stay in Bunge, according to The Citizen:
The owl, a nocturnal bird, could not leave... despite several attempts by parliament officials to evict it.
Owls are not unusual in Tanzania, and neither is Tanzanians’ inclination toward superstition. A 2010 survey found that 93 percent of Tanzanians believe in witchcraft.
No ordinary parliament session
For this particular session, the presence of the owl offered a symbolism, even for the nonsuperstitious, which was too stark to be ignored.
On the agenda for Tanzania’s first parliamentary session of 2019 were the proposed amendments of the Political Parties Act, which has followed a months-long, intense debate in an increasingly unstable political climate.
Tanzania made history in 1992 as one of the first countries in Africa to establish a multiparty system, which allowed opposition parties.
The Political Parties Act (here with proposed amendments) was also introduced in 1992 and has been amended over time with the latest amendment in 2009.
With the owl perching above the assembly, Tanzanian parliamentarians agreed to amend the act — a step that critics regard as a serious weakening of the multiparty system in Tanzania, and thus also democracy.
In short, the renewal of the act provides more authority to the government-appointed registrar to not only deregister political parties but also to issue punishments in the form of imprisonment if a political party.
For instance, carries out civic education related to voter registration and other politically-motivated activities, according to Reuters.
Several media quoted Zitto Kabwe, leader of the opposition party ACT-Wazalendo, who already back in August 2017 criticized the proposed amendment of the act, predicting it may undermine political rights.
Kabwe then compared it to the Media Services Bill 2016, which set the free and independent media back. Now, Kabwe calls attention to the inherent contradiction caused by the amendment of the Political Parties Act:
You can’t have a constitution that allows freedom of association then give someone powers to revoke that freedom of association.
In recent years, Tanzania has turned increasingly authoritarian in its legislation, resulting in less space for critical political opponents and independent media.
Now, critics say the amended Political Parties Act will make it more difficult to practice politics that are critical of the president and Chama Cha Mapinduzi (The Party of the Revolution), in power since independence in 1961.
Opposition is essential for a vibrant democracy. A strong opposition will check up on government and challenge it.
If there is no opposition, diversity of citizen needs are unlikely to be represented well.
In 15 tweets, doctoral student Rachel McLellan walked readers through possible consequences of the new act, and characterizes a situation where a critical opposition will find itself cornered:
Superstitious or not — those critical of Tanzania's authoritarian turn found some wicked relief in the presence of the owl and the unsuccessful attempts to chase it away.
The owl remained. Speaker of the Parliament, Job Ndugai, tried to tweak traditional belief with a pragmatic explanation:
Honourable Members of Parliament, we have been seeing an owl in this House since morning but in the tradition of people of Dodoma, an owl that is seen during daytime cannot have any effect on anyone.
This means that we have nothing to worry about its presence.
For the critical, however, there is nothing pragmatic about the new act.
With tensions rising ahead of 2019 presidential elections, Nigerians fear internet shutdown
Fears of an internet shutdown in Nigeria looms as tensions continue to rise ahead of 2019 presidential elections.
Fear has spread across Nigeria that the government may switch off the internet during the presidential elections in February 2019.
What started as mere speculation has morphed into intense worry as election day approaches. Yomi Kamez of Quartz Africa explains:
You can tell fears of an internet shutdown are running high in a country when citizens are looking into methods of staying online in case of a blockage.
This past weekend, Quartz Africa’s guide to staying online during internet or social media blockages was our most read story, driven entirely by traffic from Nigeria.
Scores of people shared concerns on social media at the possibility Nigeria might follow other African countries [like Sudan, Zimbabwe] that have taken to blocking social media or shut down the internet altogether under the guise of security concerns.
Recent events related to social media, hate speech, an unjust judiciary firing and replacement, and the breaking down of trust in the media have all contributed to the growing collective concern.
De-fanging the judiciary and rule of law
On January 25, 2019, Nigerians were shocked by President Muhammadu Buhari’s unilateral suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria Justice Walter Onnoghen, and the immediate appointment and swearing in of Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, as the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN).
Onnoghen had been charged with financial negligence and fraud.
However, many critics say these charges were a ploy to gag the judiciary ahead of the elections and intimidate other arms of government.
The suspension of Onnoghen contradicts the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the removal of judicial officers.
The Third Schedule, Part 1 of the 1999 Constitution states that only the National Judicial Council (NJC) has the power to recommend removals from office. Part IV of the Constitution further reiterates this law.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari did not apply these principles.
He usurped the powers of the NJC which is constitutionally mandated to recommend such removals from the judiciary or Senate (upper house of parliament) which must then ratify such decisions.
The president's action was both tyrannical and lawless.
An editorial in Punch newspaper described Buhari's action as dictatorial and capable of precipitating a constitutional crisis:
Buhari’s action is vile, perfidious and indefensible.
It is an action only fit for jackboot regimes, where the constitution could easily be suspended...
Needless to say, the president’s singular and misguided action has the tendency to plunge the country into an unnecessary constitutional crisis and, perhaps, derail 20 unbroken years of democratic governance.
This is not unlike other despotic and undemocratic acts that the government has been associated with in the past, even if it might be considered more audacious, far-reaching and probably unexpected.
The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom also condemned the attack on the judiciary.
On Twitter, netizens echoed the message.
Tackling hate speech is the new ‘national security’ mantra
Another sign of a possible internet shut down is the government’s tendency to control free speech online on the basis of concerns for national security.
Recently, the government directed security agencies to "tackle the propagation of hate speech, especially through social media".
This, according to reports by the Cable, will be achieved by monitoring social media accounts of "prominent Nigerians".
In July last year, Nigerian Minister of Information Lai Mohammed described the growing level of fake news and hate speech in the country as a threat to national security.
A year earlier, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State, described fake news and hate speech as the "biggest threat" to national security.
However, it is ironic that both Lai and El-Rufai are now concerned about fake news and hate speech as a national security threat.
As opposition politicians, they both made unsubstantiated accusations to the former government.
For instance, Nassir El-Rufai, current governor of Kaduna State alleged in 2014 — without evidence — that he was “number 7 on [President Jonathan Goodluck’s] sniper’s list”.
El-Rufai also claimed that Goodluck, then president, was a sponsor of the Boko Haram militant group. Similar claims were made by Lai Mohammed, who was then the National Publicity Secretary of APC.
As opposition politicians, these officials have in fact been proven to be purveyors of fake news and hate speech, using social media to devastating effects.
But their actions were never considered a threat to national security; they were neither arrested nor was the internet shut down for this reason.
Social media and elections in Nigeria
Movements like the 2012 #OccupyNigeria and the 2014 #BringBackOurGirls gained global acclaim due to social media usage in Nigeria.
In 2015, social media played an important role in Nigeria's elections when Twitter became a bitter and divisive battleground during campaign season and was used to propagate hate speech and disinformation.
This year, it has already played a major role as the medium of choice for political participation by Nigeria’s energetic youth population.
Netizens have used social media to call attention to despotic government actions like the sacking of the CJN, that otherwise would have gone unnoticed by the general public.
Nigerians took to social media to note their displeasure, mount pressure on the government to rescind its action and mobilize protests:
Whether or not the internet holds steady during elections, there is strong reason to believe that political speech online and on the street will be a target of government scrutiny.
Who will win Trinidad & Tobago Carnival's 2019 Road March?

When revelers take to the streets each year for Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, they do so with a soundtrack.
Their playlist is always an energetic mix of that year's hottest soca music hits, but the Road March — the song that is played the most at specified judging points along the parade route — is a title that comes with both a valuable prize package and the prestige of being part of a proud history.
For most soca performers, the appeal of winning the Road March is, quite literally, street cred.
Claims in the last decade or so of the competition being rigged — ostensibly by a group of powerful radio station owners, DJs and music industry executives known as the "soca mafia" — have not eroded the belief that the Road March represents the voice of the people.
Soca star Machel Montano, who has won the coveted Road March title a whopping nine times thus far, describes it as "the song that make[s] the people feel the most vibes and come out of themselves" — and which artist wouldn't want to lay claim to that?
But don't be fooled into thinking that the road to the Road March is solely based on creative merit.
A Road March song must have certain key ingredients to even be in the running:
1. A danceable, yet powerful melody that makes people want to “break away” on stage, with lyrics that capture the feelings of joyful release and abandon that Carnival represents.
2. A refrain that the audience can echo, in the call and response tradition of the calinda, from which calypso — and its modern-day hybrid, soca — originated.
3. A well-timed release.
If a song peaks too early in the season and doesn't have staying power, competing tunes can usurp its position.
Conversely, if a great tune is released too late, masqueraders may not have enough time to get familiar with it during pre-Carnival events.
Sometimes, the Road March contest has a clear favourite that never gets challenged; at others, the competition is so stiff that it's simply too close to call.
In no particular order, here are some the songs that we think are the biggest contenders for Trinidad and Tobago Carnival's 2019 Road March...
1. "Savannah Grass" by Kes
The Queen's Park Savannah, an oasis of green space in the middle of Trinidad's capital, is the hub of the country's Carnival celebrations and home to the festival's main stage.
This song perfectly captures the significance of the space, and the memories it has helped create for masqueraders through the years.
There is a reverence about the tune: as if the Savannah is the sun at the centre of the Carnival universe and everything else just has the privilege of revolving around it.
"Savannah Grass" is an invitation to experience this magical world.
Oxymoronically, the loose steadiness of the percussion is a nod to both the regimented dedication of Carnival lovers and their easygoing way of enjoying themselves.
The tune is both melodious and energetic, with a pace that makes it a good song for "chipping" (the light shuffle step with which masqueraders walk/dance down the road).
By its clever incorporation of archival Carnival footage, the official video further elevates the genius of the song by showing how it seamlessly spans generations and builds on the foundation blocks of calypso to produce a fresh soca offering.
Even if it does not win Road March (though it has a very good chance!), "Savannah Grass" will go down in the annals of soca music as one of the timeless tunes that stir the emotions of Carnival lovers everywhere.
2. "Rag Storm" by Super Blue, featuring 3 Canal
An interesting idiosyncrasy of "playing mas'" and dancing to soca music is that somehow, people's hands go up in the air, usually with whatever they are holding at the moment, from drinks to facecloths.
Colloquially called "rags", these come in handy for soaking up the sweat while "jumping up". The practice was not lost on Super Blue, who wrote a song called "Get Something and Wave", that won the 1991 Road March.
He echoed the concept a few years later with "Bacchanal Time", in which he commanded masqueraders to "start to wave" as the brass section played the familiar "F-jam" or "tantana" melody in the background.
Super Blue had come up with a formula for the type of song that worked on the road: he won again in 1995 with his ode to cricketer Brian Lara, in which he directed his audience to "raise yuh bat and party".
"Rag Storm" has many of those same elements — the lavway-type call-and-response, with a wild aerobic pace that encourages frenzied rag-waving.
It's a great song for the stage as masqueraders break loose and “play themselves”, and may very well prove to be one to beat in this year's Road March race.
3. "Famalay" by Machel Montano, Bunji Garlin and Skinny Fabulous
If there's one song that's aggressively going after the Road March title this year, it's this big tune that has several winning ingredients:
a driving "power soca" beat, strong lyrics that capture the essence of the unity of the festival, and a clever hook that appeals to the tribal facet of Carnival — going everywhere with your crew, or as Trinbagonians say, your "famalay" (not to be confused with "family"):
Well, let me tell you one time, famalay is famalay and that different from bloodline
Some say them is blood but them don't want to see the sunshine
Famalay doh ever ‘fraid to have your back at all time...
Without giving instructions (with the exception of one verse in which Skinny sings "show me yuh hand" and "come follow me"), the song achieves an almost militaristic sense of purpose.
Its sweet soca hook, peppered with the occasional dancehall-inspired lyrical improvisation, has been driving crowds wild at Carnival fetes.
Though there was some discussion as to whether or not "Famalay" would even qualify for the Road March contest because Skinny hails from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the rules say that once "the majority of the lead vocal performance" is "undertaken and carried out by nationals of Trinidad and Tobago", the song can be a contender — and this one definitely is.
This is not to say that it's a three-song race. With just about three weeks to go before Carnival, there other tunes — including two wicked ones by female artists Destra Garcia and Patrice Roberts — that may just give our picks a run for their money, and with soca performers still dropping new tracks, the battle for Road March 2019 is still being fought.
Let the dead tell their stories about Hong Kong

Warning: this story includes graphic descriptions of death and violence. A version of this story was previously published on Medium.
If you have traveled to Hong Kong, you have probably visited Yau Ma Tei, a popular night market district where people go to enjoy shopping and street food.
Yau Ma Tei is one of the most densely populated areas in Hong Kong.
Since 2016, the district has been the site of "20,000 ways to die in Yau Ma Tei", a guided "homicide tour" founded by Melody Chan and myself, who have lived in the area for many years.
Through the tour, we seek to address the meaning of life and living conditions in Hong Kong.
The 1.5-kilometer tour route runs north and south of Yau Ma Tei and visits 12 murder scenes over two hours.
We started it originally as a Halloween activity to raise funds for a local organization.
As the feedback was excellent, we continued organizing tours at night during the winter months when the weather is cooler.
The tour guides are social workers, teachers, medical doctors and other professionals.
Thus far, about 500 people have taken the tour.
The homicide cases we selected date mostly from 2012 to 2016. Details of the cases were compiled from newspaper reports and records from the Coroner's Court.
Below is a trailer of the tour's 2017 edition on YouTube:
So close, yet so isolated
The population density in downtown Kowloon peninsula is about 44,000 people per square kilometer, and about 20,000 people live in Yau Ma Tei.
Many apartments are sub-divided into smaller units. People live so closely together, but at the same time, they are quite isolated.
Quite a number of the cases featured on the tour involve elderly people.
In one case, an old man committed suicide by jumping out of the fourth-floor window of a building with a rope tied around his neck.
The body dangled on the outer wall of the building above the street all night, but no one noticed it until the next morning when the residents of a building across the street opened their window.
Another case involves two elderly people who were found dead at home, one starved to death.
It was later revealed that the husband was the caretaker of the wife, who was suffering from dementia.
The husband had a fall in the living room and died, and the wife slowly starved to death in bed.
It is difficult to imagine that no one had taken notice of the somewhat desperate living conditions of two elderly people.
According to the 2016 population census, there were about 1.16 million people aged 65 and over in Hong Kong—about 15.9 per cent of the total population.
About 150 thousand of those people lived alone.
The average monthly income of retired elderly people in 2016—including pension and family and government support—was HK$5,780 (US$720).
The current individual median income is about HK$16,800 (US$2,200) dollars.
But living with family or others does not guarantee support. There are many family tragedies in the city, among the working classes, in particular.
In one case, the deceased was a 15-year-old girl who was into cosplay. She performed well in her studies but quarrelled with her family because of her hobby.
Eventually, she dropped out of school and became a photo model to earn a living.
She was murdered by a client who had paid her HK$500 dollars (US$65) to take pictures of her.
In another case, a dead baby with its umbilical cord intact was found in a bag in Yau Ma Tei subway station by a cleaning lady.
Upon investigation, the police found out that the mother was a foreign domestic helper who became pregnant and was afraid that her employers would dismiss her. The woman was arrested and jailed.
During this segment of the tour, the guide raises the question: aren't the woman's employers also guilty?
It is difficult to imagine not noticing that the person who served you daily is pregnant.
There are more than 370,000 helpers in Hong Kong and the law requires them to live in their employers’ homes.
This arrangement makes them vulnerable to abuse in the form of long working hours, poor diet, etc.
About a year after that case, another foreign domestic helper was fired for getting pregnant.
It took two years for the woman to successfully appeal the illegal termination of the contract in court.
Grassroots murderers
Many of the murders in Yau Ma Tei are crimes of passion committed by ordinary people, and as is typical when the crime is not premeditated, the perpetrators make many mistakes.
There is the case in which a man killed his older brother in an open street with a nine-inch fish knife that penetrated the brother's lungs.
The knife was supposed to be a gift for the brother.
One killer stayed at the crime scene after the murder; another used his ID card to book a hotel room to hide the body.
Another murder took place in a convenience store.
The incident was recorded by closed-circuit TV.
The murderer was a tourist holding a Canadian passport, who stabbed the storekeeper after the latter questioned him for taking items from the shop without paying.
An encounter with souls and their shadows
The majority of tour patrons are college students.
Some join out of curiosity; others consider it a way to educate themselves.
A doctor who was part of a team of medical workers who took the tour said this of one case:
The protagonist of the case is very similar to the patients we often encounter in the accident and emergency wards – drug addicts, street sleepers, refugees.
We all have to rescue them in the emergency room.
But usually they are quite hostile in their attitudes.
It’s very difficult to deal with them and we tend to lose patience over time.
This guided tours remind us that we must be patient and should not become indifferent.
And their lives are very miserable and they struggle hard to survive.
Yau Ma Tei's 20,000 residents will all eventually die in different ways.
We believe that upon their death, their souls will become part of the fabric of the city and continue to linger in the alleys and streets, reminding people of the meaning of existence.
The tour aims to create a space for these shadows to reveal their stories.

Rulers of authoritarian countries might sometimes settle on a very controlled interview with state media once a year or less.
The answer to this question in Azerbaijan is quite extraordinary.
Earlier this month, President Ilham Aliyev, who became Azerbaijan's leader in October 2003, gave his first-ever interview to local television.
The hour-long February 12 interview with pro-government journalist Mirshahin Aghayev — once known for having a more independent stance — was broadcast on the privately owned pro-government broadcaster REAL TV.
It aroused significant interest in Azerbaijan, where citizens are used to listening to Aliyev make speeches but unaccustomed to seeing him discuss ideas with an interlocutor.
Even Aliyev's Twitter account comes across as a bizarre monologue rather than an attempt at public outreach.
In the end, however, the interview proved an underwhelming debut.
Many on social media commented on the president's understated body language, somewhat dazed appearance and a reliance on state media talking points.
Given that Aliyev does not have to impress anyone — Azerbaijan has never had a free and fair election in its 27-year independence — why did he bother to do this?

The topics of the interview broadly mirrored those highlighted in state media — the long-standing conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, public services, economic reforms and Azerbaijan's relations with the Eurasian Union and European Union trade blocs.
No new insights were provided.
After the video received a host of negative comments like "Resignation" and "No more tales are needed" in addition to dislikes during its first day online, REAL TV's YouTube channel closed comments.
Opposition politician Azer Gasimli said the interview showed the government was "very worried" amid stewing public dissatisfaction and a sluggish economy.
I watched Ilham Aliyev's first interview with a local journalist.
I think it is meaningless to say or write something in response to what the President said.
Because we have responded to him for many years.
The interview was not sincere.
Both the President and the journalist remind me of "ships floating on a lie".
My conclusion: the government is very worried!
Habib Muntazir, an independent journalist also complained the interview was short on substance:
The only thing I learned was "Grandma Saray".
I'm sure that this "grandma" would say something more interesting than Ilham Aliyev.
Muntazir's reference to “Grandma Saray” addresses Aliyev's visit to the Shamakhi region of Azerbaijan, where an earthquake destroyed several homes earlier this month, including one belonging to a 92-year-old woman called Saray.
State propaganda had seized on Aliyev's meeting with Saray, who has since been celebrated as a model citizen for her stoicism and faith in the future of the Azerbaijani state after the quake.

As can be seen from an abridged translation of the REAL TV interview, Aliyev went overboard in his praise for the elderly citizen, name-checking her seven times in quick succession:
Such grandmothers and mothers, like Grandma Saray, have been preserving our national and spiritual values ​​for centuries.
Every Azerbaijani woman wants to be akin to grandmothers Saray.
Look, a 92-year-old woman whose house is destroyed, how much optimism in this woman!
Grandma Saray is confident that the state will be with her.
Honestly, during a trip to Shamakhi, I did not know that I would meet Grandma Saray.
I examined the houses affected by the earthquake, familiarized myself with the situation there.
When I saw Grandma Saray, I was once again convinced of how great the people of Azerbaijan were.
We can be proud of our people.
She was in a difficult situation; her house was destroyed.
She probably did not even know that someone would come to her aid.
She did not know whether her house would be repaired or a new house would be built.
Grandmothers like Saray are the embodiment of the unbending spirit of the Azerbaijani people.
Another independent journalist, Sevinc Osmangizi, staged a call in canvassing reactions to the interview on YouTube immediately after the interview was broadcast.
Viewers mostly registered their disappointment and called for change.
One said:
I could not watch the interview any longer and I turned off the television.
Because both the interviewer Mirshahin Aghayev and his questions were very fake.
Their promises to us is no longer matter.
Because people are now tired of such frauds and lies.
People want innovations and real reforms.
A Tibetan-Canadian student was attacked online after winning student council elections.
She thinks Beijing is to blame.
Image from Chemi Lhamo Instagram via The Stand News.
This article was originally written by Leung Hoi Ching and published in Chinese on Hong Kong based citizen media, the Stand News on February 15, 2018.
The following trimmed English version is translated by Zhao Yunlin.
On February 9, students at the University of Toronto's Scarborough Campus elected Chemi Lhamo, a 22-year-old student of Tibetan origin, as their student council president.
Just days after the election results were announced, thousands of mainland Chinese overseas students signed an online petition of protest, accusing Lhamo of having close associations with pro-Tibet independence organizations.
They demanded the school disqualify her from the elected position.
Demeaning comments from overseas mainland Chinese students
Lhamo’s personal social account was flooded with demeaning comments and veiled threats of violence from overseas students who appeared to be from mainland China.
As her story began to make headlines in international media outlets, students from Hong Kong and Taiwan fired back in defense Lhamo's defense.
In a phone interview with Stand News, Chemi Lhamo said she believed that the incident was mobilized by organizations associated with Chinese government, an accusation that Chinese officials have denied.
Before this election, I had already been elected as vice-president of the student council for eight whole months and nothing ever happened.
However, after all these sudden events, you cannot help but think that there is an organization manipulating these events behind the scenes.
It’s really funny how I’ve been serving as a vice-president for so long, how I’ve organized many events and never held back from expressing my ideals, but nobody has ever asked me about my political opinions.
She also said that her fellow students from mainland China began to behave strangely.
One of Lhamo’s classmates from mainland China spontaneously asked her, via mobile message, to draft a statement regarding Tibetan independence.
She also received phone calls playing "red songs" (propaganda songs praising the Chinese Communist Party).
Lhamo could not understand these songs, as she does not speak Mandarin Chinese.
Alongside the joint attacks and the comments on the internet, a group of students went to the student council office to demand that the election results be reconsidered.
The campus student council has now temporarily closed its conference room, for safety reasons.
Chemi Lhamo has been a student activist for some years.
She is an active member of the Tibetan community in Toronto and once joined a protest outside the university's Confucius Institute, the local branch of a global network of Chinese cultural institutions that are sponsored by the Chinese government and intended to promote China's soft power overseas.
In recent years, she has also exchanged views with social activists from Hong Kong and Taiwan on topics related to freedom of speech, self-determination, democracy and related topics at public events.
Lhamo has never been afraid to speak up or show her Tibetan identity – she wears a Chuba, the traditional Tibetan dress, every Wednesday.
Until the election, she had never perceived any animosity from her Chinese classmates.
This is what led her to worry that this barrage of harassment was instigated by Chinese authorities.
From stateless refugee to student council president
Before immigrating to Canada at 11 years of age, Chemi Lhamo was a stateless refugee residing in India. Her grandparents were forced into exile along with the Dalai Lama in 1959.
Within these rigid borders, no matter where she and her family went, they were looked down upon.
Every time someone asks me: "Where are you from?"
I always end up struggling to answer – I sometimes say that I’m from India, but I was denied citizenship status there; sometimes I say that I’m from Tibet, but when they ask me how Tibet is like, I really don’t know how to answer, because the Chinese embassy won’t even issue me a visa to go to Tibet.
But it’s this experience of being viewed as an outsider that has made me understand my people’s culture better: the Tibetan culture.
Lhamo recounted that when she had just immigrated to Canada, a new kid from Tibet unexpectedly came to class.
She was excited and happy to have found someone from her own land to become friends with, and she knew that he could speak the Tibetan language.
However, frowning at her, he told her: “How about we don’t speak Tibetan?
I can speak English.”
I don’t know if he was either ashamed or had some kind of guilt.
I really don’t know.
But it was then when I realized that some young Tibetans don’t want to speak their own language as if they were being pressured to speak another language.
At the time, Lhamo was only 12 years old.
Feeling insecure about her identity, she convinced her parents to move back to a neighborhood with a Tibetan community.
From then on, she learned more about Tibetan language, culture and Buddhism and became an activist.
Tibetan values, such as be considerate, be respectful to the elderly, ignorance as the root for negativity and etc., has give me a lot of strength.
And the more I understand my culture, the more confident I feel.
This strength and confidence, she says, has enabled her to speak up as an immigrant and a Tibetan:
Being an immigrant is very difficult, but this struggle is what makes me who I am.
Today, I speak about the Tibetan people loud and clear with pride thanks to the strength that my identity as a Tibetan gives me.
During the student council election, I often emphasize the need for the marginalized to have their own representation during the student council elections.
We need representation so that our rights be upheld.
Suffering will end
For Lhamo, the ideal world is one without borders or boundaries — Tibetan independence and autonomy is not the real issue at stake.
My vision for Tibet is the same vision that I have for the whole world: I wish for Tibetan people to enjoy the same rights as Canadians, namely freedom to express themselves, freedom of belief, freedom to avoid political oppression.
I don’t only wish for Tibetan people to enjoy these rights, I also wish that people from Hong Kong and Taiwan, Eastern Turks, the 60 million refugees around the world and for everyone to enjoy these rights.
Many people in Hong Kong believe that China has become more authoritarian in recent years, adopting a more heavy-handed policy towards political dissidents and ethnic minorities.
Even in Hong Kong, the space for freedom of speech and association has diminished.
Chemi Lhamo is familiar with the political challenges faced in Hong Kong after the 2014 Umbrella movement but she shared her optimism with Hong Kong people and urged them not to give up:
I learned a concept from the Tibetan culture known as impermanence: everything has an end and I believe that all suffering will also end…I hope that one day I’ll be able to go to Tibet wearing my Chuba.
A steep price hike for passport applications pushed Angolans to protest
At a protest in Luanda, the sign says "30.500 Kwanzas is a lot".

Angolans are enraged about the government's new passport fee of 30,500 kwanzas (around 97 US dollars), introduced on 21 January.
Previously, the fee costed 2500 kwanzas (8 US dollars).
In addition, the government has put in place a new price scale for all types of travel.
It states that authorities will charge 45,250 kwanzas for a staying visa; 21,350 for a tourist visa; 36,500 for tourist visas given at the border; 38,125 for extensions of working visas; 15,250 for medical visas; and 30,500 for a permanent residency card.
Valdemar José, spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, told Angola Press that the price rise for ordinary passports was justified by the higher cost of producing the document:
Translation Original Quote
The government adjusted the real value of the passport and stopped subsidising it, giving, for example, priority to issues of water, light and products of primary necessity.
The materials for producing passports have a higher cost, because of the security features in the documents, which until now the state subsidised.
This is reminiscent of what Mozambicans experienced in late 2018, when the government also decided to increase the fees for legal documents, as well as for driving licenses, by 500 per cent.
The price hike has sparked controversy.
A protest by around 100 youths took place on 4 February, and was promoted by a group of citizens who saw the government’s measure as a clear attempt to restrict people’s right to travel.
The protest

On 4 February, Global Voices spoke with Fernando Gomes, an Angolan activist and one of the promoters of the protest, to learn more of the details around the event.
He told us:
Translation Original Quote
This [was the] way found to attract the attention of João Lourenço’s government, that this is not the best time to increase the price, as citizens lose purchasing power in an exponential way.
And that the much alluded to "diversification of the Angolan economy" cannot occur exclusively through raising direct taxes, given that they only hit citizens, the political class has various privileges, which are paid for by the already impoverished citizens themselves.
Critics say that it is important to remember that a passport is a citizen’s identity document abroad and, as such, an inescapable necessity for a lot of citizens.
Translation Original Quote
We are going to be in the capital city’s streets for the whole month of February, on staggered days, 4 February was the beginning of the demonstrations, but on the 7th we will return to the streets, and again we will be there on the 11th and on the 13th we will hold a debriefing, if the government does not backtrack on the implementation of the presidential decree.
Two young rappers, Lilo Kwanza and Adérito Gonçalves, made a song and video about this protest movement, with the title "Passport for 30 thousand", ironically commenting on the costs of the document to citizens.
Days before the demonstration, the Angolan activist Pedrowski Teca said that the passport is more important than the identity card, asking people to join the protest:
Translation Original Quote
International demonstration against the absurd rise in the prices in Migration Acts.
OBS: The identity card (B.I) only identifies an Angolan within national territory.
Outside Angola, the identity card is useless, as the only valid identification document is a passport.
We, inside the country, are going to protect and call on our compatriots in the diaspora to follow the same path, as the passport is more useful for them.
To amplify the message, the activist and university student, David Mendes, wrote, on the day of the demonstration, a message for the Angolan president João Lourenço:
Translation Original Quote
Comrade president João Lourenço, it was not for this that the Angolan people voted for you, in no moment of your campaigns did you spoke about a change of price of document, after all what are you thinking?
Where is the voice of the people?
We already have a miserable life with these price rises, do you have an idea of the difficulty that you are causing for the people?
We sincerely do not know who is the right man to govern our Angola, how will a youth who has no job find the money to get the documents?
So far, the government has not reacted publicly, nor announced if it would consider reducing the price of passport.
It's Emancipation Day in Trinidad & Tobago — but is the country free?
Citizens examine what stands in the way of true freedom

August 1 is celebrated in many Caribbean territories as Emancipation Day, marking the freedom of enslaved Africans who were victims of the transatlantic slave trade.
Trinidad and Tobago was the first country in the world to declare a national holiday to mark the abolition of slavery, but 34 years after that first public holiday was instituted and 185 years after the Slavery Abolition Act first came into effect, great discussion continues over whether or not the twin-island republic is emancipated.
Speaking about the issue on July 27, 2019, Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley observed that among Trinidad and Tobago's diverse population, people of African descent "are not doing as well as we expected".
Rowley said that rising levels of violence which are part of the black, urban youth experience, should be inspiring citizens to "focus, reflect and have serious conversations about where we are as a nation".
Chairman of the country's Emancipation Support Committee, Khafra Khambon, agreed.
Some letters to the editor gave examples of modern slavery to make the point that true emancipation still seems a long way off, while others tried to make the occasion a political one, by criticising certain social services and a culture of “handouts.”
The Trinidad Express chose to feature an opinion on Emancipation Day which suggested that Rowley, Kambon, and activist Pearl Eintou Springer were wrong about why some Afro-Trinbagonians may be underperforming:
It is easy for a dominant group to create a system that discriminates and subjugates.
Those who do not measure up to that system are categorised as under-performers and relegated to second class or worse.
So many of our systems, education the leader, put people unfairly in a caste and they are not given a second chance.
Every system has a rating and the further away it is from the top, the lower the ranking.
Those who find themselves on the bottom rung have great difficulty coping with the elevated systems.
Self-esteem is low and in their perceived helplessness may even drive them to employ violence to counter-punch suppression.
Commentator Arthur Dash lauded the country's “commendable history of maturity” when it comes to discussing race-related issues, but he also suggested the problem lay deeper, within the system itself, and suggested the prime minister's message should motivate citizens to examine how institutional racism continues to be a restrictive force.
Social media users shared their musings as well. In a public post, Facebook user Adrian Raymond said:
On this day we remember and commemorate the freedom of our ancestors from the physical bondage of slavery.
Today, many generations later, we the decendants [sic] of slaves struggle with the legacies left by colonialism.
Legacies which thrive and are perpetuated by stereotypes: We are not savage, we are not violent, we are not predators, we are not just thugs and gangsters.
We are leaders, revolutionary thinkers, visionaries, philosophers.
We are Obama, Garvey, Marley, Angelou, Walcott.
Let us recognize that colourism is an inherited tool used to divide us.
Let us call out respectability politics: a culture of dilution; stop playing down blackness to make it palatable to the masses...
Let us celebrate the rediscovery of our faith and belief systems.
They took away the religion of our ancestors, they took away a belief system and sense of values.
In today's world of information access you owe it to yourself to explore the belief systems of our ancestors, the reverence and honouring of the elders, the owning of one's actions an emphasis on choice and consequence, there is belief in the family, the extended family, the village, the community.
This emancipation embrace the fullness and richness of who you are, where you came from, the blood and history that's in your veins.
Own with pride who you are, your culture, your identity.
Bangladeshis use social media to tackle a dengue outbreak
Many are resorting to social media to collect blood

In the past few years, especially during the monsoon season, the number of dengue fever cases has risen in Bangladesh.
This year, it took an alarming turn with a total of 7,179 cases recorded – nearly 2800 of them from the first half of July alone.
As government resources are seemingly overwhelmed by the severity of this recent spike in dengue cases, people are turning to social media to voice their complaints, share information about the spread of the virus, and to spread awareness about how people can protect themselves.
Record highs in July
22 July saw record highs as 403 new dengue patients were admitted to hospitals in a 24-hour period.
According to some experts, the effects of climate change, intermittent rain, unusual weather patterns, and lack of cleanliness are the main culprits for the rise in dengue cases.
Others also shared that this year's strain of the dengue virus is deadlier than in previous years. According to Twitter user Md. Saif:
"This year the strain and symptom of the disease have changed so you need to go to your doctor immediately after catching the fever" – according to an expert physician at the Bangabandhu Medical Hospital.
Severely affected patients are having multiple organ failure – this was unheard of in the previous years.
In an interview with the Bangla Tribune, Dr. Gulzar said that people who were previously infected with dengue have a greater risk of reinfection.
Translation Original Quote
This year Dengue has a new strain, deadlier.
It is inducing Dengue shock syndrome.
There may be another cause – many were infected in the previous years, many perhaps did not notice.
When they are being infected the second time, it is becoming deadlier.
Reports about new infection cases are spreading on social media and many users are becoming increasingly worried.
Shofiq Ahmed shared a Tweet about a newly reported case:
Even two doctors died in Dengue fever, and people are afraid now.
The Dhaka Highcourt has summoned the Chief Health Officers of the government.
The death toll is incereasing.
Is the government doing enough?
BBC Bangla Facebook page asked its readers to report back about any efforts by city officials in Dhaka to combat the spread the mosquitos.
User Mohammad Mynuddin reported astonishing delays on the part of government officials to address the outbreak:
Nothing has been seen.
A (City Corporation) worker has said that it would take a few weeks to import the protective drugs to decrease mosquitoes.
I was astonished 🤔🤔
With what many see as a lack of government response to the spike in dengue cases, citizens are taking to social media to raise awareness about the virus.
Citizen media news outlet Health Barta uploaded a YouTube video detailing what to do when someone has dengue fever:
Many are resorting to social media to collect blood for patients.
User Sajid Islam Khan tweeted that he needs blood for his brother who is suffering from dengue.
Hannan Gazi posted a similar message:
The symptoms of dengue fevere and what to do..
Amidst the outbreak, the Mayor of Dhaka City North has canceled holiday leave for waste disposal and mosquito deterrent teams.
However, to protect people from dengue fever, a lot more effort may be needed.
Demolition of a 150-year-old building highlights government neglect of Bangladesh's heritage sites
The landmark building was demolished despite a High Court Directive

In Dhaka, a century-old heritage building was demolished clandestinely on the night of Eid-ul-Fitr on June 5, 2019.
The ship-like structure, known locally as "Jahaj Bari", was built around 1870 and considered to be the first commercial building in Bangladesh's capital.
Its demolition has caused many to speak out against the neglect of Dhaka's architectural treasures.
Media reports alleged that supporters of the ruling Awami League (AL) party brought three bulldozers to the location and demolished the building.
The supporters claim that their leader, local member of parliament (Dhaka-7) Haji Md. Salim, bought the property to build a multi-story building on the site.
The AL supporters also claimed that the building was not included on any heritage list.
On August 13, 2018, the Dhaka High Court issued a directive to the government agency responsible for coordinating urban development in Dhaka to not approve or allow the demolition or modification of 2,200 archaeologically significant buildings around the capital city.
Jahaj Bari is also part of a Waqf (mortmain) estate that, as part of a charitable donation, could not be sold.
According to the administrator of Bangladesh's Waqf Administration, it is mandatory to have permission in order to hand over, sell or develop any Waqf property.
Contrary to the claims of the AL activists, no such permission was requested for the sale or demolition of the building in question.
In March 2019, an attempt was made to demolish the building.
Urban Study Group, a volunteer-run nonprofit group dedicated to protecting the historical urban fabric of Old Dhaka, filed a complaint to stop the demolition, citing the above mentioned High Court order.
However, according to newspaper reports, some locals are happy that the building was demolished.
They felt that it was in a dilapidated state and feared that it would fall down on them—an indication of the lack of awareness of historical preservation and support for the restoration of heritage buildings in Bangladesh.
Heritage history—just empty words
Many expressed their anger on hearing about the destruction of the building.
Shuvra Kar wrote on Facebook:
Translation Original Quote
Heritage, history, culture these are just empty words in this country!
Writer Tania Kamrun Nahar explained why this heritage building needed to be saved:
Translation Original Quote
The three-storied "Jahaj Bari" had beautiful motifs on the railings.
The long verandah had designed roofs.
The whole building had many beautiful designs — pointed arches, decorated cornices.
The columns had ionic and Corinthian capital designs.
The building had such remarkable designs which were rare to find in other buildings in the old parts of Dhaka.
So, the building needed to be saved.
Dhaka was established as the capital of Bengal in 1610, more than four centuries ago.
During the years of Mughal rule and British colonial rule, many buildings were built that form part of the history and heritage of the city.
But most of these buildings are long gone.
The ones that remain are in a dilapidated state and are destined to be grabbed by occupants claiming ownership of the buildings (often by forging documents).
One example is Bara Katra, a historical and architectural monument built between 1644 and 1646 AD by Mir Abul Qasim, the Diwan (chief revenue official) of the Mughal prince Shah Shuja.
The building is on the verge of collapsee due to the lack of maintenance, preservation efforts, and damage caused by illegal occupants.
Bara Katra, the structure was built according to the traditional pattern of Central Asian caravanserais and is embellished in the style of Mughal architecture.

He wrote in a local newspaper Bhorer Kagoj:
Translation Original Quote
I have pleaded to the authorities in the past four decades to save the heritage buildings like Bara Katra and Choto Katra.
But nobody listened.
When the philatelic department demolished part of the old walls of the famous Lalbagh Fort to make a car park, what can you say?
How can you fight against stupidity?
An online news portal has published an in-depth report about government negligence of these heritage buildings and the influential people trying to demolish existing buildings:
Translation Original Quote
The no. 14 house in the heritage list has already been taken down.
Most parts of the famous big house in Sutrapur has been destroyed.
The relics of the Mughal era in Bangshal Mukim Bazar Jam-e Mosque and Siddique Bazar Jam-e Mosque are gone with a new structure in place in the name of renovation.
Although there is a government directive to protect heritage buildings, the officials of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha and Dhaka City Corporation are not doing anything.
Their inaction is encouraging greedy parties to grab the old properties and destroy them.
The Urban Study Group has organized rallies and human chains to protest these demolitions.
They are also keen to create awareness to protect other endangered heritage buildings.
Here are some more images of Bangladeshi heritage buildings in peril:

China arrests filmmaker for retweeting an image of a liquor bottle referencing Tiananmen Massacre
Baijiu bottles commemorating the Tiananmen massacre.
The following post is originally written by Jennifer Creery and published by Hong Kong Free Press on May 24, 2019.
The following edited version is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.
Chinese authorities have reportedly detained documentary filmmaker Deng Chuanbin after he tweeted an image of a liquor bottle labelled "64" – a reference to the date of the Tiananmen Square Massacre which occurred on June 4, 1989.
64 liquor bottle
The liquor bottle was designed in 2016 to commemorate the 27th anniversary of June 4.
The liquor was called "8 wine 64".
The pronunciation of the word "wine" in Putonghua is the same with the word "9".
The bottle label carries the image of "Tank Man" with the description "Never forget, never give up".
It also specifies that the wine comes from Beijing, with 64% alcohol and has been stored for 27 years.
Four Chinese men, Fu Hailu, Zhang Jinyong, Luo Fuyu and Chen Bing, were arrested in 2016 for the liquor bottle incident charged with "inciting subversion of state power".
Fu, Zhang and Luo's trial took place at the Chengdu Intermediate People’s Court in April.
They were respectively handed a three-year prison term with four to five years in suspension.
Chen is still under arrest as he refused to plead guilty.
Despite the suspended sentence, the three are still under surveillance:
Arrest for a retweet
Ahead of the 30th anniversary of June 4, filmmaker Deng Chuabin has become the latest victim related to the 64 liquor bottle.
Sichuan police arrested Deng at his home in Yibin last Friday, hours after he retweeted a Twitter photo of 64 liquor bottle, according to the NGO coalition, Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD).
The filmmaker received a phone call from police 30 minutes after tweeting the image despite quickly deleting the post, said CHRD.
Police seized three mobile phones, a computer, laptop, iPad, memory cards and compact camera while at his home.
Deng is reportedly being held in Nanxi District Detention Centre for "picking quarrels" – a charge frequently leveled against critics of the government.
CHRD said police returned to raid Deng’s home for an hour, taking a range of electronic equipment:
18 people are talking about this
Update on #Deng Chuabin: On May 20, 2019: Deng's father was summoned to the police station at Peizhi town.
A few men followed him back home and took video and photos in their house.
They search Deng Chuabin's room for more than an hour and took away 20 electronic items including battery chargers.
They even took away the electronic wire of their rice cooker.
On 21, the police station told Deng's parent not to employ lawyer for Deng.
Deng, also known as Huang Huang, is an independent filmmaker who has collaborated with Beijing artist Ai Weiwei.
He claims to have previously faced intimidation by authorities, including detention in 2015 to prevent him from attending a human rights seminar in Geneva.
Next month marks 30 years since the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
Each year, Chinese authorities clamp down on references to the crackdown in the lead up to the anniversary, by placing outspoken dissidents on house arrest or in detention.
A duty to remember: 30 years after Tiananmen
Installation made by Taiwanese artist Shake, and inspired by the photo of Tank Man displayed in central Taipei.

It has been 30 years since the rise and fall of the 89 Democracy Movement (八九民运) in China that culminated in the infamous Tiananmen Square Massacre on June 4, 1989.
On that day, the Chinese military carried out a brutal crackdown on student-led demonstrations calling for democratic reforms.
The Chinese Red Cross estimated that 2,700 civilians were killed, but other sources point to a much higher toll.
A confidential US government document unveiled in 2014 reported that a Chinese internal assessment estimated that at least 10,454 civilians were killed.
The Communist Party of China has never publicly acknowledged these events or accounted for its actions with an independent investigation.
There are no references to the 89 Democracy Movement in any history textbooks and most university students in China have never heard about the massacre.
Global Voices has been covering the issue for over a decade.
This year we commemorate the 30th anniversary of what led to the June 4 massacre to fulfill our duty to keep the memory of those events alive, despite continuous efforts by Beijing to deny basic historical truth.
Beijing’s determination to censor any mention or veiled reference to June 4 has resulted in a perpetual game of cat and mouse taking place online.
In April, a foreign ad featuring images of the Tank Man circulated briefly on Chinese social media before being suppressed.
Another of our stories explains how Chinese netizens play with censorship and come up with creative ways to allude to the event without mentioning it by its name, yet when they get caught, the punishment is immediate and severe.
All of this in an environment where obtaining information that is not filtered by China’s Great Firewall of online censorship has become very dangerous and almost impossible.
Expressing critical views on social media platforms outside of China also poses a personal risk, as you can read in this story.
And expressing alternative views not aligned with the Party’s line, even if embedded in Marxism, usually results in harassment and arrest, as we describe here.
This draconian censorship is being exported worldwide by Beijing, including to Hong Kong.
Yet the duty to remember continues to inspire people and netizens across the globe.
Direct witnesses speak up in emotional interviews, while brave journalists in Hong Kong tell their own stories about June 4.

Jamaica’s ‘Voices for Climate Change’ spreads its message with music
Screenshot from the YouTube video "Voices for Climate Change Education – 2019 Campaign", published by Panos Caribbean.
The organisation has launched an eight-month climate change community awareness campaign in four communities across Jamaica: Rocky Point and Lionel Town in the parish of Clarendon, Ridge Red Bank in St. Elizabeth and White River in St Ann.
From reggae and dancehall music to jingles extolling the virtues of everything from laundry detergent to fast food, the way to any Jamaican’s heart is through song — prompting Panos Caribbean, a media-savvy non-governmental organisation, to take a musical approach to spread its environmental message.
The organisation has been successfully sharing critical information with the public through its Voices for Climate Change project.
Those voices rang out loud and clear at the historic United Nations Conference in Paris (COP21) in 2015.
There, Jamaican singer and songwriter Aaron Silk joined forces with other musicians — including Belizean performer Adrian Martinez — to advocate for a 1.5-degree limit to global warming.
The musical message, which supported the position of Small Island Developing States, was considerable, influencing the aspirations reflected in COP21’s final document.
Years later, the “1.5” message continues to resonate in the eastern Caribbean, where singers have intertwined St. Lucian poet Kendel Hippolyte’s words with their own lyrics in order to ensure the message hits home.

The climate change crisis in 2019 is even more urgent than it was four years ago and in Jamaica, rural citizens from farmers to fisherfolk are heeding the wake-up call.
Artists, schoolchildren and community members came together in different parts of Jamaica — Kingston, Lionel Town, Ridge Red Bank and White River — for four days of workshops during the months of March and April.
There, they honed their communication skills and learned about the impact of climate change.
Powerful lyrics emerged, ideas flowed and eye-opening field trips provided on-the-ground perspectives:

Mother Earth she bawls
Deep in the forest where the trees fall
Look upon the reef, see the fish how small
Give them a little time, make them grow big and tall

With Panos’ launch of a new Caribbean theme song for Earth Day, the Jamaican group is booked solid for school and community concerts, as well as the Read Across Jamaica initiative and tree-planting sessions.
Lyrics like these, delivered to a roots reggae rhythm and infused with dancehall vibes, somehow manage to hit home:
Mother Nature yearns for life
The more the factories burn, she cries.
When will we learn, and be wise?
The more the ice caps melt, the sea rise.
Despite the release of detained Reuters reporters, free speech remains under threat in Myanmar
Two Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo walked free from Insein prison in Yangon.

Media groups and human rights advocates are celebrating the release of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo who spent more than 500 days in detention for their role in investigating the massacre of some Rohingya residents in northern Myanmar.
But despite their release, the state of free speech in the country is still undermined by the continued detention and persecution of some artists, journalists, and activists.
Consider the following cases:
Defamation case against The Irrawaddy
A defamation complaint was filed by the military's Yangon Region Command against The Irrawaddy's Burmese-language editor U Ye Ni over the news website's alleged unfair coverage of the armed clashes between government forces and the insurgent Arakan Army in Rakhine State.
The Irrawaddy said it did nothing but report the escalating armed clashes in the region since the start of 2019.
Here is U Ye Ni’s response to the case filed by the military:
I feel sorry about the military’s misunderstanding of us.
Journalism dictates that we reveal the suffering of people in a conflict area.
Our intention behind the coverage is to push those concerned to solve the problems by understanding the sufferings of the people.
The Irrawaddy is a content partner of Global Voices.
Jailed for satire
Meanwhile, five members of the Peacock Generation Thangyat troupe were sent to Insein prison to await trial for their satirical performance mocking the army. Thangyat is performance art similar to slam poetry featuring folk verses with traditional musical notes and is combined with song, dance, and chants.
The group was charged with violating article 505(a) of the penal code which criminalizes the circulation of statements, rumors, or reports with the intent to cause any military officer to disregard or fail in his duties.
Zeyar Lwin, one of the accused, said:
All of our cases are political issues so that they need to resolve them as political issues.
And also, I’d like to say all of us need to join the work for amending the 2008 constitution being done in parliament.
In my opinion all of these issues can be resolved if we can do the primary work of amending the constitution.
Zeyar Lwin is referring to the 2008 constitution which many analysts believe was designed to reinforce military rule even after the restoration of civilian leadership.
Sickly filmmaker in detention
The case of filmmaker Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi also reflects the restrictions imposed on critical artists.
A complaint filed by a military officer against the filmmaker's ‘defamatory’ Facebook posts led to his arrest.
Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi is the founder of the Myanmar Human Rights Human Dignity Film Festival and a known critic of the military's involvement in politics.
His supporters are calling for his release on humanitarian grounds, since he has had half of his liver removed due to cancer and suffers from heart and kidney problems.
The Human Rights Film Network, a partnership of 40 human rights film festivals around the world, sent this letter to the government:
As a concerned international human rights community, we seek reassurance from the Myanmar government to ensure that Section66(d), which was meant to enhance progress of telecommunications, will not be used to silence the voice of Myanmarese civilians seeking to voice their opinions and take part in the democratic process in Myanmar.
The letter refers to the controversial Section 66(d) defamation law which has been used by authorities to charge critics, activists, and journalists.
Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi's petition for bail was rejected by a local court. His next hearing is scheduled for May 9, 2019.
“They should never have been jailed in the first place.”
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years in prison for violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
The Supreme Court upheld their conviction last April with finality but they were released from prison after they were granted a presidential pardon during the country’s traditional New Year.
Groups like the Southeast Asian Press Alliance welcomed the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo but they also highlighted the injustice suffered by the two reporters:
They should never have been jailed in the first place, because they committed no crime.
While we welcome this positive development, the case of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo is proof that journalists are in constant risk of political reprisal for keeping power in check.
Brazilian indigenous people buy shares in railway company to denounce its failed environmental obligations
Indigenous peoples say the newly expanded railway impacted the area's wildlife and threatens their safety.

On April 24, the shareholders’ meeting of Rumo Logística, a Brazilian railway consortium, had a few new, unexpected faces: a group of five indigenous people of Guarani and Tupi ethnicities who had recently bought six shares of the company.
They each represent one of the five officially designated Indigenous Lands in the southeastern state of São Paulo that was affected by a 90-year-old cargo railway which Rumo operates and, in 2014, began to expand.
In order to compensate for the impact caused by the railway expansion, the state contractually obligates the company to "build new houses, prayer sites, a bridge, community gardens and acquire micro-tractors" for the communities.
Around 5,000 people live across the five Indigenous Lands impacted by the railway's expansion.
But indigenous representatives say the company has failed to fulfill such duties, according to a story by Folha de São Paulo.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office confirms this: 63 out of the 97 renovation works provided for in the concession contract are frozen.
On April 19, prosecutors recommended Ibama, Brazil's national environmental agency, to immediately suspend the new railway's construction as well as Rumo's operation license.
They also recommended the agency to fine Rumo in 10 million reais (2,5 million US dollars).
In a letter read at the April 24 assembly, the five indigenous shareholders detailed their plight.
They've described how the trains have affected wildlife in the area, as well as limited people's circulation.
In addition, they've reported their struggle in dialoguing with the Rumo, and also discredited the corporation's latest Annual Sustainability Report, which states Rumo it is "perfectly fulfilling their obligations, in a participatory and inclusive way, with the affected indigenous communities".
Speaking with reporter Pedro Biava of newspaper Brasil de Fato, Adriano Karai, of Guarani ethnicity, said the indigenous shareholders’ goal was simply to have their voices heard by the company's investors rather than profiting from the shares (which they bought for 17 reais each, around 4,30 US dollars).
Karai also described how the newly expanded railway has affected his community of Tenondé, located in the city of Paralheiros:
Translation Original Quote
There is the noise of the train, which runs all night.
The animals don't show up at hunting places anymore.
We don’t have any quiet nights.
They also transport a lot of grains that end up spilling on the land, and we know that that food isn't of good quality, it is transgenic.
Our lives are also in danger: the train passes through our territories, where walk visiting communities through trails.
We are in constant danger of being hit by a train, because now there is one every ten minutes.”
According to the Folha story, the indigenous communities initially proposed to Rumo that it outsourced the renovation works to a local committee run by the communities themselves.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the company had initially agreed, but shortly after the October 2018 election of President Jair Bolsonaro, who ran on an explicitly anti-indigenous platform, it shifted its approach.
On November 20, Rumo suddenly canceled its participation at a meeting with the communities, and since then hasn't shown up at any other meetings.
Speaking with Folha, the company said it never signed any agreement with the indigenous communities of outsourcing the renovation works to their committee.
The shareholders’ assembly on April 24 ended without any formal agreements, but Rumo's representatives said that the indigenous claims will be discussed at an internal meeting in May.
Expansion works began in 2014. Around 5,000 indigenous peoples live in the area.

Shareholder activism
The Guarani and Tupi aren't the only ones engaging with so-called "shareholder activism", a practice that isn't very common in Brazil.
In 2010, the group Articulation of those Affected by Vale (Articulação dos Atingidos e Atingidas pela Vale) purchased the company's shares in order to sit at their assemblies.
Vale one of the largest mining corporations in the world, and the operator of the dam that ruptured in the city of Brumadinho in January 2019, killing 236 people (34 are still missing).
On April 30, the day of a shareholders’ meeting, Articulation members pinned posters with the deceased people's names on the walls of Vale's headquarters, as reported by newspaper O Globo.
By voicing their concerns at those meetings, the companies are forced to register the activists’ demands in their minutes.
One of the Articulation members, Carolina de Moura, herself a Vale shareholder, told O Globo:
Translation Original Quote
We will keep speaking up.
The company must invest everything they make in improving our rivers and caring about human lives.
Tanzanian authorities detain and deport Ugandan human rights leader
Dr. Wairagala Wakabi [Image by CIPESA and used with permission]
Wairagala Wakabi, a leading digital rights advocate from Uganda, was detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 25.
Wakabi was invited to speak at the annual Tanzania Human Rights Defenders’ Day hosted by the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC).
Wakabi is the Executive Director of the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), one of the foremost organizations working on internet policy and online free speech in Africa.
Wakabi was deported back to Uganda after several hours of interrogation, during which he was denied access to a lawyer.
Attorneys from the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition attempted to advocate on his behalf, but were told only that Wakabi was being deported on grounds of "national interest":
Though the ordeal lasted only a few hours, it brought great consternation among rights advocates in the region, who have grown wary of Tanzania's treatment of activists and journalists.
In November last year, Angela Quintal and Muthoki Mumo both staff of Committee to Protect Journalists, were detained for several hours in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and had their passports temporarily seized.
Human Rights Watch asserted that Tanzania under the leadership President John Magufuli has witnessed "a marked decline in respect for free expression, association and assembly".
In 2015, the United Republic of Tanzania promulgated the Cybercrimes Act.
Within a year of the passing of that law, at least 14 Tanzanians were arrested and prosecuted under the law for insulting the president on social media.
March 2018 saw the passing of the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, making it mandatory for bloggers to register and pay roughly US $900 per year to publish online.
This caused many independent blogs to go dark.
The stifling of independent media through a mixture of sanctions against media outlets and legal threats against journalists has created an atmosphere of intimidation, self-censorship and fear of expressing alternative views about the country’s leaders.
The detention and subsequent deportation of Wakabi back to Uganda appears to be a continuation of the Tanzania's government assault on free speech and dissent.
Digital journalist Luis Carlos Diaz is missing in Venezuela
"Where is Luis Carlos?"
Image of the public online campaign shared by Provea.
In the image they indicate the last time he had been contacted and the last time he tweeted.
On the evening of March 11, political commentator Naky Soto and wife of Venezuelan journalist and media activist Luis Carlos Diaz tweeted that he had been missing for five hours.
[Update] The Union of Press Workers (in Spanish, the SNTP) reported that Luis Carlos had been detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Forces (SEBIN):
URGENT A Sebin commission confirms that journalist Luis Carlos Díaz has been detained by that police organism.
They pointed their weapons at journalist [and members of the Press Union] Marco Ruiz, Luz Mely Reyes and Federico Black.
Hours before, Soto had tweeted that Luis Carlos Díaz had been missing for five hours:
@LuisCarlos is on his bike, but since 5:30 I've heard nothing from him and:
– he's not at the radio station
– he's not at home
– he hasn't tweeted
– he isn't answering calls
– he isn't answering SMS or WhatsApp messages
---‘Boca de Rua': The Brazilian newspaper produced entirely by people living on the street
After 19 years, Boca is still telling stories from the street

Nineteen years ago in Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, a newspaper made entirely by people living on the streets was created.
Boca de Rua (Mouth of the Street, also known as Boca) newspaper was ideated by a group of journalists who wanted to provide this community with the tools to speak for themselves.
The project was conceived in 2000 and a year later, during the first meeting of the World Social Forum, the first edition of Boca was launched.
Today, the newspaper is the only member of the International Network of Street Papers (INSP) created entirely by people living on the streets.
The ideas for stories, interviewees and questions are all developed by the community itself.
Two journalists, who have been with the project since the beginning, are responsible for designing every new issue.
A group of volunteers also helps with support such as recording meetings, guiding the reporters about notetaking, and transcribing notes on the computer.
Published as a quarterly.
Boca's coverage ranges from reports of abuses suffered by those on the street to positive stories.
Over a period of three months, the group decides on the direction of the coverage, they go out into the field, conduct interviews, take photographs and gather testimonies for the stories.
Member turnover is high, but on average, about 50 people work on each edition.
After printing, each member of the group receives a share of copies to sell on the streets of Porto Alegre and all the proceeds go to the journalist/vendors.
The publication is also sustained by donations from supporters, many of them anonymous.
Rosina Duarte, one of the creators of Boca de Rua and the NGO ALICE (Free Agency for Information, Citizenship and Education), to which the newspaper is linked, said that the initial aim was “to give a voice to those who don't have one”.
In time, however, they realized that this was presumptuous — the voices were always there, society just didn't listen to them, she says.
In a telephone interview with Global Voices, Rosina says:
Translation Original Quote
When we arrived, we still had those pretty words which hold a lot of undertones of “nice prejudice”, as I call it, which is wanting to give something to them to help.
But we realized that it was us who had to become literate in the language of the street.
They didn't have literacy in written language, but we were completely illiterate about life on the street.

The journalists’ original idea was to create a radio broadcast program using speakers installed on the city's lamp posts.
But when they contacted a group of homeless people, they were adamant: “We want a newspaper about us”.
Rosina says the idea worried her at first, but it worked:
Translation Original Quote
When they said they wanted a newspaper, we went after funding, still feeling our way in the dark, not knowing what to do.
But one day the penny dropped: by telling what was happening on the streets, they were breaking news.
And if they became aware of this, the paper would organize itself very clearly.
Because we make news all the time.
Some people do it in a more objective way, others less objective, but we do it.
Over time, the newspaper also became a kind of social movement.
The group meets weekly to discuss collective demands and possibilities for supporting the individual issues of its members.
It is also linked to initiatives in the field, such as the Movimento Nacional da População de Rua (National Movement of People on the Street) and Amada Massa (Loving Dough), a bakery that aims to generate autonomy for people with a history on the streets in Porto Alegre.
Regarding the content of the stories told by the paper, Rosina recalls:
Translation Original Quote
It seems like it's just suffering, it seems like it's just difficulty.
And it's not, we have discovered this joy, this resistance, we appreciate this immense, fantastic capacity to survive, not only to stay alive, but to keep hope, joy, affection and all these things alive.
Voices from the streets
In a telephone interview with Global Voices, Elisângela Escalante, who joined the group six years ago when she was on the streets, emphasized the importance of the newspaper in her life:
Translation Original Quote
A lot happened to me through the paper.
It got me off the street.
Because I lived on the street for three and a half years and I got out after a few months going to the paper.
I was saving some money and started to rent my own space.
Before I didn't earn my money, I depended on my partner for everything.
It makes a difference for me, I like to have my own money.

Elisângela remembers one edition in particular, where the cover story asked: “Why can't we be mothers?”.
The report talked about the challenges that women with street backgrounds face in motherhood.
While producing the report, some women members of the newspaper managed to regain contact with their children who they hadn't seen in years, Elisângela says:
Translation Original Quote
I think what we say [in the paper] is the truth.
It's what we feel and what we experience within society.
If it weren't for Boca, I wouldn't have any other way to do this and be heard by so many people.
Through it I got a lot of things and I helped a lot of people too.
For the first time in its history, the newspaper is unable to be sold on the streets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In an effort to alleviate the effects on the reporters’ income, Boca de Rua has been transformed into a digital version.
With a contribution of 20 BRL (around 3.75 US dollars) every three months, readers access the latest edition of Boca, as well as old editions and other material.
For the contributors and reporters, the most important thing is that the voices from the street continue to be heard during the pandemic.
When asked in a telephone conversation about his feelings about the newspaper, Marcos Sher, a 13-year veteran of Boca, said:
Translation Original Quote
For me it's good, very good.
So you can see I'm not letting go, right?
Sometimes I stop for a while, but I come back again.
For me, the newspaper was a way to get out of [drug] trafficking and go back to work.
It's good because it's something to do, to get me out of the house.
Having something to do is very important for me.

Kenyan Families suffer spillover effects from school closures
Kenya's 'out-of-school learning' curricula requires digital access that many lack
Editor's note: This post was co-written by Global Voices contributor Bonface Witaba and guest contributor Sri Ranjini Mei Hua, a researcher and writer from Singapore.
In March, the Kenya government announced the suspension of schools as part of its measures to curb the spread of COVID–19.
The announcement threw the school curriculum into disarray, affecting 18 million learners nationwide.
It also threatened to derail progress toward inclusive, equitable and quality education as described in Agenda 4 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
As part of efforts to ensure continued learning while protecting the health, safety, and well-being of learners and educators, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with education partners and stakeholders, designed the Kenya Basic Education COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan, with the objective to promote “out-of-classroom learning” through radio, TV, e-cloud, and mobile phones.
Today, in spite of efforts by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) to expand online content delivery, an estimated 80 percent of learners still do not have access to remote lessons, according to a study carried out by Usawa Agenda (an education network).
This is due, in part, to unequal access to technology such as computers, laptops or smartphones, as well as prohibitive internet costs and unreliable internet access, especially for learners from disadvantaged families and marginalized communities.
Even where the technology is available, there are concerns around young children’s unsupervised internet usage.
Prior to the lockdown, learners were able to access free meals at school.
Girls were able to access sanitary towels through an initiative to provide free sanitary towels.
However, with the prolonged shutdown, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha declared the school calendar as “lost,” meaning schools will remain closed until 2021, leaving thousands of students in a dire situation as their families are unable to afford food and basic necessities due to recent unemployment.
In Kibra, for instance, an area deemed to be the largest informal settlement in Nairobi (and in Africa), most learners are unable to access KCID’s “out-of-classroom learning” curricula, and most do not have a place to study, much less play or exercise.
(For many years, the area was called “Kibera,” a mispronunciation of the word kibra, a Nubian word for “forest.” Kenya's Nubian community feels using “Kibera” robs them of their identity).
In a Skype interview with Asha Jaffar, a journalist residing in Kibra who covers stories about the plight of the Kibra community, Jaffar told Global Voices that there were a limited number of free libraries that allowed up to 10 learners at a time to do their homework.
However, these learners are required to give up the space to the next lot of learners after about an hour.
She added that free tuition initiatives for learners have had to scale down due to social distancing rules imposed by the government and health officials.
Asha Jaffar, a journalist and Kibra resident, points over Kibra settlement.

The long-term impact of school closures are wide-ranging and even more devastating to families living below the poverty line.
As food security takes precedence over education, learners — particularly girls and young women — from vulnerable families often have to work on farms and contribute to household chores or care work instead of learning.
This played out during the lockdown which coincided with the peak planting season in March.
Some girls may even be subject to early marriage which puts them at a higher risk of dropping out of school, often as a result of early pregnancies.
Hence, educational outcomes for the most vulnerable families will suffer as they have little reason to send their children back to school when it reopens.
In March, Jaffar launched Kibra Food Drive to help alleviate hunger in the Kibra community through donations of food parcels to the most vulnerable families.
It started through donation solicitation via M-Pesa (a mobile wallet), with the aim of feeding 100 vulnerable families a week, but with an increasing need for support, the initiative has fed 2,400 families, as of August 5.
Jaffar recognizes that providing free meals is not enough because the families ultimately need support to start small businesses.
However, the community remains in a deadlock as trade and economic activity stalls.

Kenya anticipates a new academic year in 2021 — but this all depends on the number of COVID-19 infections — according to Education Cabinet Secretary Magoha.
Several education experts say that this period is an opportune time for the government to conduct a gap analysis of the education system and perform a complete reboot in the quest to provide equitable access to learning for all as envisioned in the Kenya Basic Education COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan.
The first step would be to allocate budget toward improving the school infrastructure in terms of lighting, desks and chairs and providing reliable electricity supply — especially in rural areas.
Next, the government could lower water and electricity tariffs for schools as these huge costs are hurting their operations.
Only when these priorities are sorted can efforts resume on a stalled digital literacy project initiated in 2013 by the government.
The digital literacy program aimed to ensure that learners in lower primary school (grades 1-3) can use digital technology and communication tools, with an overarching objective to transform learning in Kenya into a 21st-century education system.
The project stalled barely got off the ground after its pilot phase due to failure to meet intended outcomes and educators being ill-prepared to scale out the initiative.
To achieve success, the program requires extensive ICT training for educators so they can effectively use and troubleshoot these gadgets.
Kenya has progressed from a Universal Primary Education (UPE) agenda into an Education For All (EFA) agenda.
UPE, the second goal in the United Nations Millennium Development Goal, aimed to ensure that by 2015, all children around the world completed primary schooling, whereas EFA, was a global movement led by UNESCO, aimed to bring the benefits of education to “every citizen in every society.”
With these gains, Kenya cannot afford to roll back on progress.
Kenya’s next challenge is now to ensure that learners have access to digital literacy projects that provide not just conventional education, but holistic, skills-based, autonomous learning in order to meet its education vision and sustainable development goals by 2030.
The struggle to end Nigeria's brutal SARS police unit continues
Nigerian youth continue to protest throughout the country

Over the last week, Nigerian youth have risen up in masses to wage war against a unit of the Nigeria Police Force known as The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), notorious for extrajudicial killings, extortion, kidnapping, and rape since the unit was created in 1992.
More than 100 people have reportedly been killed by SARS in past four to five years, according to Amnesty International.
Nigerian youth — often the target of SARS — have, on several occasions, clamored for a total scrap of the unit, to no avail.
But this time, several recent arrests and killings in Lagos State sparked the zeal to make this a reality — after the SARS was disbanded about four times in four years — has driven mass action on the streets.

This war against police brutality has also created a wave of awareness and generated a lot of conversations in the media space.
Protests have erupted in at least 12 of Nigeria’s 36 states, including Abuja, the federal capital, and Lagos, where protesters have blocked toll gates and airports within the state, hoping it makes an economic effect so elected leaders can acknowledge the protesters’ wishes in no time.
Here are the protesters’ demands:
Nigerians in the diaspora have also taken to the streets to show their displeasure with the notorious SARS unit which has, for years, committed crimes with impunity.
Protesters have gathered to denounce SARS in London, England, Dublin, Ireland, Ottawa and Toronto, Canada, Cologne, Germany, Moscow, Russia, Pretoria, South Africa, as well as Texas and Washington, DC, in the US.
At least 10 protesters have been killed during the protests, according to Amnesty International.
Among those killed is Jimoh Isiaq, killed in Ogbomosho, Oyo State, and Ikechukwu Ilohamauzo, killed at the Surulere protest in Lagos, whose names both went viral on social media.
Medical doctors have begun to accompany protesters in cases of emergency.

Inspector-General of Police Muhammad Adamu disbanded the unit a few days ago, but Nigerians are not convinced this will take effect as the previous disbandment of the unit never yielded positive results.
On Monday, President Muhammad Buhari of Nigeria assured citizens that the disbandment will be effective immediately and that the federal government will establish a presidential reform panel to look into police welfare and other critical areas, ensuring the demands of the masses be put into action.
Some lawyers and human rights activists among youth activists have been working hard to release detained protesters.
Protesters have made it clear that the fight to end SARS is not politically motivated, warning politicians, including members of opposition parties, not to hijack the protest for individual, party or political gains.
Protesters insist that there are no leaders in their movement and that every person who comes out to protest is a leader and follower alike.
They insist that the presidency and/or the Inspector-General of Police address all grievances at once and not just a few selected individuals.
The question about who controls the police and SARS has not been adequately answered.
The constitution vested control of the police to the presidency under the supervision of the police chief.
But that chain-of-command and control seems to have broken.
To release protesters at Surulere, Lagos State, for example, it took calls from State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, speaker of the federal house of representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and Desmond Elliot, Lagos State House of Assembly members representing Surulere and a few lawyers.
On October 12, the governor of River State, Nyesom Wike, announced through a tweet that no protest — especially the #EndSARS protest — is allowed in his state.
That doesn't sit well with citizens.
Several individuals responded through various platforms that the constitution which made him governor also gave citizens the fundamental right to protest.
However, Wike recanted and addressed the protesters, expressing support for their cause.
The protests continue in several parts of the country including River State. Protesters have promised not to back down until signs of compliance are seen by police and also the federal government.
On Tuesday, October 13, protesters reported on Twitter that at Iwo Road, Ibadan, members of the Nigerian Army were marching with protesters in solidarity.
Also on October 14, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu walked with protesters, reassuring them of the commitment of the government to end the menace.
The Lagos State Government says that ten victims of the July 4 Ijegun pipeline explosion have died due to severe and high degree burns suffered from the inferno.
The Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Health, Dr Titilayo Goncalves, who made this known to newsmen in Lagos,said that three of the victims died at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, while seven died at Gbagada General Hospital.
According to her, out of the 22 victims rescued by the Lagos State Ambulance Service, nine were taken to LASUTH, 12 to Trauma and Burns Unit of Gbagada General Hospital and one to Alimosho General Hospital.
She also said that they are doing everything possible to ensure that no other life is lost and from reports received, they are responding to treatment.
Greece's new Prime Minister, MrKyriakos Mitsotakis has said that he would not fail to honour the hopes of the Greek people after New Democracy's landslide victory.
Mr. Mitsotakis emerged the winner of the election with several votes.

On May 25 and 26, 2019, the “Be Strong!” circuit assembly program in the Lingala and Tshiluba languages was held within the Lóvua refugee camp.
This camp is 1,022 kilometers (635 mi) from Angola’s capital, Luanda.
At the time of the program, there were 177 publishers and their families living in the Lóvua camp.
Yet, some 380 people attended the Lingala-language program with 3 baptized, and 630 people attended the Tshiluba-language program with 6 baptized.
Most of the brothers who fled to Lóvua did so because of violent unrest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Our brothers in Lóvua are unable to attend spiritual events in other cities, due to camp travel restrictions.
Therefore, the branch arranged to hold the assemblies within the camp and also constructed two temporary Kingdom Halls.
These Kingdom Halls accommodate four congregations—three Tshiluba and one Lingala.
On May 24, 2019, the circuit overseer and a branch representative traveled to the Lóvua camp to help set up the sound and stage equipment.
Despite our brothers’ challenges as refugees, they contributed tarpaulins, poles, rope, nails, and other needed materials.
After the program, Honoré Lontongo, a ministerial servant in one of the Tshiluba congregations in the refugee camp, commented:
“Seeing the assemblies held here inside the refugee camp, despite the difficult conditions, makes us feel Jehovah’s love not only for us as a group but for us as individuals.”
I am so happy!
Some 50 Bethelites serve full-time in the city of Douala, Cameroon.
They will soon be able to enjoy a new branch facility, as the offices that are currently located in the Bonabéri quarter of the city will be replaced by a newly constructed facility in the Logbessou quarter.
The construction of a new branch office is indicative of the expanding theocratic activity in Cameroon, a country in which the Memorial of Christ’s death was attended by over 100,000 people in 2017, over twice the number of publishers.
Our brothers installing lightning protection.
The construction site is beside an already existing Assembly Hall.
The work has begun in earnest with the excavation of the foundations.
When the project is complete, the final design will be in the style of apartments commonly available in the area with a separate office building, as shown in the rendering above.
According to current projections, the Bethel family will be able to move in at the end of 2019.
Some of the over 2,800 brothers and sisters who attended a special meeting to learn how they can support the construction of the branch.
“It is impressive to see thousands of our brothers and sisters who have volunteered to help with the construction displaying the Isaiah-like spirit,” states Gilles Mba, a member of the Cameroon Bethel family who works with the Public Information Desk. (Isaiah 6:8)
He adds, “This bustling activity has energized all of us who work at the branch.
We are eager and ready to use the new offices for their dedicated purpose—to honor Jehovah’s name.”
Over the past year, construction of the new branch facility in Cameroon has been underway.
As shown in the photo above, partial structures of the four residences and office building are now in place.
The new branch will accommodate 60 people and the office will have 71 workspaces.
Current projections indicate that the facility will be ready for use near the end of December 2019.
The following photo gallery provides an update on the progress of the work. A rendering of the proposed branch facility.
Jehovah’s Witnesses released the Bassa-language edition of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures at a regional convention in Douala, Cameroon, on August 2, 2019.
The release of the Greek Scriptures was the culmination of an 18-month endeavor.
This is the first time that Jehovah’s Witnesses have translated a Bible into a language native to Cameroon.
rother Peter Canning, a member of the Cameroon Branch Committee, released the Bible on the first day of the regional convention at the Logbessou Assembly Hall to an audience of 2,015.
Prior to the release of the Greek Scriptures, our Bassa-speaking brothers and sisters had to rely on a costly translation that was hard to understand.
One of the translators on the Bassa project explains: “This newly released translation will help publishers to more readily understand the Bible.
It will increase their love for Jehovah and his organization.”
An estimated 300,000 people speak the Bassa language in Cameroon.
There are 1,909 Bassa-speaking publishers serving in the Cameroon branch territory.
Since December 2017, internal conflicts between the Hema and Lendu communities in the Ituri province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have resulted in numerous deaths and the displacement of tens of thousands of people.
Many of our brothers and sisters are among those who have been affected by the escalating violence.
Thousands of Congolese refugees have fled to Uganda to escape the turmoil, including 192 publishers who are living in two refugee camps near the Congo border.
As of June 2018, an additional 1,098 Witnesses have fled the conflict zone to Bunia, the provincial capital of Ituri.
Sadly, a married couple as well as three young children whose parents are baptized publishers died because of health complications.
However, none of our brothers and sisters have been killed in the brutal fighting.
Brothers and sisters who have fled from various parts of Ituri pictured on the Assembly Hall grounds in Bunia.
The homes of many brothers who have fled from the conflict have been looted or burned to the ground.
Additionally, many of the crops that the brothers cultivated for their livelihood were destroyed.
From the time the fighting began, publishers outside the conflict zone have provided practical help to their affected brothers.
Some loaned their vehicles to evacuate publishers to safety (see lead image).
Additionally, 205 Witness families from Bunia supplied money, food, and housing to their displaced brothers, despite being of limited means.
Although there are two sizeable refugee camps in Bunia, all of the displaced publishers have been taken in by local Witnesses
The Congo Branch Committee established a Disaster Relief Committee, which provided basic necessities to our brothers and sisters.
A branch representative also visited the affected brothers and provided spiritual encouragement.
Despite being displaced, brothers and sisters who have fled to Bunia and other areas are gathering to worship with local congregations and are actively sharing the good news with others.
From February to April 2018, the brothers started over 270 Bible studies with individuals in the refugee camps.
Amidst a climate of civil unrest, there has been an ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since August 2018.
Over 1,088 cases of Ebola resulting in 665 fatalities have been reported in the areas of North Kivu and Ituri.
Sadly, this outbreak has affected our brothers.
The Congo (Kinshasa) branch reports that, among Jehovah’s Witnesses, ten adults and two children have died from the disease.
Another brother was infected with the disease but recovered.
In order to educate the brothers about disease prevention, the Congo (Kinshasa) branch received approval from the Coordinators’ Committee to prepare a special video and discourse.
The video offered practical suggestions such as the installation of handwashing stations, a measure that all congregations have implemented.
These practical measures have helped to reduce the spread of the disease.
As a result, two public health officials were moved to send the branch office letters of appreciation for the exemplary conduct and cooperation of Jehovah’s Witnesses during the Ebola disease outbreak.
In many cities, our brothers have been quarantined in their homes for weeks at a time.
To reduce further the possible spread of disease during this volatile time, the branch office has asked 12 circuits to postpone their regional conventions.
To ensure that the brothers still receive their spiritual food, the branch has arranged for affected congregations to watch a recorded video of the convention program in their Kingdom Halls.
Eritrea is the center point of some of the most intense persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in modern times.
As of September 17, 2019, three of the brothers, Paulos Eyasu, Isaac Mogos, and Negede Teklemariam, have been incarcerated for 25 years.
In addition, 39 other brothers and 10 of our sisters are imprisoned.
All of our brothers and sisters currently in prison have never been charged, appeared in court, or sentenced.
They do not know when they will be released.
Four brothers have died while in prison, and three died after they were released because of the harsh conditions they suffered.
Persecution in Eritrea intensified on October 25, 1994, about a year and a half after Eritrea became an independent country from Ethiopia.
The new president declared that Eritrean-born Jehovah’s Witnesses were no longer considered citizens primarily because they stood firm to their Christian neutrality.
The president also stripped them of basic civil rights.
Among other restrictions, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not able to receive a full secular education, own a business, or travel outside of the country.
In recent years, prominent human rights bodies have expressed increasing concern over Eritrea’s blatant disregard for international human rights standards, including cases involving our fellow Witnesses.
Eritrea has failed to implement the recommendations issued by these authorities.
See: “SPECIAL REPORT: The Persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Eritrea”
We will continue to inform government officials and others in authority about the situation in Eritrea.
On Sunday, March 10, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
All 157 people on board were killed.
Sadly, one of our sisters, Rosemary Mumbi, was among those killed in the plane crash. We are deeply saddened to hear of this tragic loss.
Sister Mumbi was 66 years old and a full-time minister in the Roma Manzoni Inglese Congregation in Rome, Italy.
To reach seldom-worked territories in Gabon, the Cameroon branch organized a special campaign from June 1 to August 31, 2019.
The focus was to reach the residents of the ten most populated cities: Franceville, Koulamoutou, Lambaréné, Libreville, Makokou, Moanda, Mouila, Oyem, Port-Gentil, and Tchibanga.
The campaign was an international effort, as it included 400 volunteers from Belgium, Canada, France, and the United States.
Over two million people reside in Gabon.
While an estimated 80 percent of the population speak the official language, French, an estimated 30 percent also speak Fang as their mother tongue.
Therefore, the campaign was conducted in both languages.
A Fang-speaking person interested in the Bible, who lives in the Bissegue quarter of Libreville, responded: “This was the very first time I have listened to the message of God in my own language!”
One sister who participated said: “This campaign has truly manifested the love and unity of Jehovah’s organization.
On January 15, 2019, at least 21 people were killed in an attack on a hotel and office complex in Nairobi, Kenya.
The Kenya branch reports that no publishers were killed or injured in the attack, which took place some seven kilometers (four mi) from the branch office.
More than ten brothers and sisters are employed at the Dusit complex, the location of the siege.
At the time of the attack, seven were not at work; the rest were safely evacuated.
Among those evacuated were one brother and one sister who hid for 12 hours during the siege.
Jehovah’s Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in the Luo language at a regional convention in Kisumu, Kenya, on August 30, 2019.
Brother Remy Pringle, a member of the Kenya Branch Committee, released the Bible on the first day of the convention.
A total of 2,481, including those tied in at two other conventions, were in attendance.
The translation work took about three years to complete.
One member of the translation team said: “It will have a huge impact on brothers and sisters who have yearned to see the complete New World Translation in Luo.
Most families in our congregations could not afford the complete Bible for everyone in their household, and so it will be a blessing for each to have a copy.
Also, the modern language used in this translation will make personal and family study more faith strengthening.”
The New World Translation has been translated, in whole or in part, into 184 languages, including 25 complete revisions based on the 2013 edition.
We are sure that this release will assist the approximately 1,800 Luo-speaking publishers in the Kenya branch territory to continue drawing close to Jehovah.
It will also help in the efforts to preach effectively to the over 5 million people who speak Luo.
A new Bible school facility was dedicated in Eldoret, Kenya, on November 9, 2019.
Brother Bengt Olsson, a member of the Kenya Branch Committee, gave the dedication talk before a crowd of 1,199, including some 500 special full-time servants who had traveled from various parts of the country to attend.
The 433-square-meter facility (4,660 sq ft) will host classes for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers (SKE) and the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.
At least four SKE classes are expected to graduate annually from the facility.

Commenting on the school’s significance, Brother Olsson states: “The territory in East Africa has tremendous potential for growth. We are certain that the training provided to the students in the schools will play an important role in caring for future increase, as people stream to the mountain of Jehovah.”
Madagascar is recovering from the destructive Cyclone Ava, which struck the country on January 5, 2018. Officials have reported that at least 51 people died and thousands were displaced.
Initial assessments from the branch office in Madagascar indicate that no brothers were killed by the storm.
However, at least 45 homes have been damaged or destroyed, as well as 6 Kingdom Halls.
The storm also destroyed local crops, which serve as the livelihood for many of the publishers in the country.
A Disaster Relief Committee was formed to care for the immediate needs of the affected publishers, which included providing food supplies, clothing, and temporary shelters.
Two brothers from the branch office also traveled to the disaster area and held a special meeting with all the families affected by the cyclone to give scriptural encouragement.
The Governing Body facilitates disaster relief efforts, including the relief work in the aftermath of this cyclone, using funds donated to the Witnesses’ global ministry work.
We pray that Jehovah will continue to be a secure refuge for our brothers and sisters in Madagascar during this time.

On April 25, 2019, Cyclone Kenneth struck northern Mozambique.
This is the second cyclone to hit the country after Cyclone Idai caused widespread devastation in March.
This latest storm caused severe flooding and landslides, which destroyed homes, washed out roads, and further damaged the area’s already unstable infrastructure.
Some 300 publishers live in the province of Cabo Delgado, but none were injured or killed by the storm.
However, 9 of our brothers’ homes were destroyed and 16 sustained damage.
Additionally, one Kingdom Hall was destroyed and three sustained damage.
The circuit overseer in the area, a Local Design/Construction field representative, and two brothers from a remote translation office were able to visit all of the affected congregations and offer needed support.
On January 12, 2019, our brothers in Nigeria hosted a special meeting at the Benin City Assembly Hall in Nigeria.
During the event, Geoffrey Jackson, a member of the Governing Body, announced the release of the revised New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Isoko and Yoruba.
A total of 60,672 people tied in to the program.
Satellite locations included 106 Kingdom Halls and 9 Assembly Halls in Nigeria, as well as venues in the neighboring country of Benin.

Brother Gad Edia at the Nigeria branch office reports: “It took three years and two months to complete the Isoko translation of the Bible, and three years and three months to translate the Yoruba edition.”
He concludes: “In Nigeria, over 5,000 Witnesses speak Isoko and well over 50,000 speak and read Yoruba. When the brothers received their revised translations, one person described the audience’s reaction as an ‘explosion of delight.’ So we can say with confidence that the effort was well worth it!”
To date, Jehovah’s Witnesses have made the New World Translation available in whole or in part in 179 languages.
Extreme rains in southwest Nigeria from July 6 through July 12, 2017, caused flooding in the states of Lagos, Niger, and Oyo. News reports indicate that at least 18 people have died as a result.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria has confirmed that none of Jehovah’s Witnesses have been killed or injured during this disaster, though four were displaced.
Additionally, two of the Witnesses’ homes sustained damage and another one was destroyed.
Witnesses in Nigeria are providing relief aid to their fellow worshippers as well as their non-Witness neighbors, a number of whom also were displaced or lost homes.
Heavy seasonal rains have triggered severe flooding in Nigeria primarily in the central and southern regions of the country.
Water levels in the Benue and Niger rivers, the two major waterways in the country, have overflowed their banks, displacing thousands of people and leaving over 100 dead.
Initial reports indicate that none of our brothers have been killed or injured.
However, the flooding has displaced at least 2,000 publishers, and over 1,000 of these are in need of relief aid.
The majority of those who fled their homes have found shelter in homes of fellow Witnesses located in safe areas.
A Disaster Relief Committee has been established to coordinate relief aid and to provide spiritual encouragement.
Two members of the Nigeria Branch Committee, along with the circuit overseer and brothers working in the Service Department and Local Design/Construction Department, have visited the publishers in the affected areas to provide support.
Despite the challenges brought on by this disaster, our heavenly Father, Jehovah, continues to be a “fortress in the time of distress.”
At the end of September 2018, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Rwanda reached a milestone in their efforts to share the Bible’s message in the languages of their branch territory: the inauguration of translation work into Rwandan Sign Language (RWS).
These efforts will benefit some 113 deaf brothers and sisters in Rwanda and will better equip publishers to preach to the over 30,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the country.
The RWS translation team has translated the brochure Listen to God and Live Forever, the short video Why Study the Bible?, and most of the tracts that are part of our Teaching Toolbox.
These publications will be made available on our official website in the coming weeks.
The RWS translation team works in a facility that is just a five-minute walk from the Rwanda branch office in Kigali.
The team consists of two brothers, one of whom is deaf, and two sisters.
Each member of the translation team is proficient in sign language and completed a four-week-long training course designed to assist them in learning the principles of translation.
The Rwandan Sign Language translation office, located a short distance from the Rwanda branch office.
One of the RWS translators, Rwakibibi Jean Pierre, explains why sign language presents obstacles not present when translating into a language that has a written alphabet: “Deaf people communicate ideas visually by using their hands and facial expressions, so sign-language translators translate text to video by employing a special technique called idea mapping.
Using a whiteboard, we convert the English text into drawings that act as a guide as we express the ideas of the original text in sign language.
To ensure the clarity and accuracy of the finished product, an outside panel of deaf Witnesses reviews the translated materials and offers feedback.”
Mr. Augustin Munyangeyo, board chairman of the Rwanda National Union of the Deaf.
Mr. Augustin Munyangeyo, board chairman of the Rwanda National Union of the Deaf, a national nongovernmental organization that advocates for the rights of deaf Rwandans, comments on the Witnesses’ RWS translation work: “We deeply commend Jehovah’s Witnesses for providing religious education using the Bible and videos prepared in Rwandan Sign Language.”
To date, Jehovah’s Witnesses translate into over 90 sign languages worldwide, and have produced a free app, JW Library Sign Language®, that also allows users to access Bible-based publications in more than 90 sign languages.
The availability of these many sign-language publications assists our brothers and sisters worldwide to declare the good news “to every nation and tribe and language and people.”—Revelation 14:6, footnote.
One year before the RWS translation work began, the Rwanda branch held the first Pioneer Service School in RWS from September 4 to 9, 2017.
The class, which was made up of 23 students, learned how to become more effective when teaching deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals about the Bible.
The pioneer school instructors for the RWS class followed the curriculum outlined in a sign-language translation of the book “Fully Accomplish Your Ministry.”
The students used a supplemental workbook developed specifically for teaching the Bible in sign language.
For example, it conveys main points through illustrations instead of written text, and is designed to allow students to draw in their own illustrations as memory aids.
The Pioneer Service School began in the United States in December 1977 and since then has gradually extended worldwide.
During the 2018 service year, pioneer schools were conducted in 83 lands.
Brother Ricardo Braz, one of the instructors, interviews a student, Brother Nyandwi Jean de Dieu, during the Pioneer Service School.
The 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda was one of the fastest-moving and most horrific genocides in modern history.
The United Nations estimates that some 800,000 to 1,000,000 were murdered in about 100 days.
The majority of victims were Tutsi, but Hutu who refused to support the killings were also marked for slaughter.
This meant that every one of the 2,500 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Rwanda faced mortal danger.
About 400 of our Rwandan brothers and sisters perished in the genocide, most of them Tutsi.
But Hutu Witnesses also died because it was unthinkable for them to harm others or to abandon their Christian brothers and sisters to the killers.
Brother Charles Rutaganira, a Tutsi who survived the genocide 25 years ago, still vividly recalls that Sunday morning when he was certain that he would be killed—and how self-sacrificing love saved his life.
When about 30 attackers swarmed his house, he was in disbelief.
He says: “Most of them were my neighbors. We said hello to each other every day.”
But when the mob came to his house that morning, he saw that they had changed.
“Their eyes were red and filled with hate.
They looked like animals eager to devour their prey.”
The mob assaulted Brother Rutaganira with machetes, spears, and clubs studded with nails—simply because he was a Tutsi.
Then, they dragged him out to the street and left him there to die.
As he lay there semiconscious and bleeding, a crew with shovels came by to bury his body.
Apparently, one of them recognized Brother Rutaganira as a peaceful Christian man and asked, “Why did they kill this Jehovah’s Witness?” No one replied.
Just then, a heavy rain began to fall and they left.
Samuel Rwamakuba, a Hutu brother who lived nearby, heard about Brother Rutaganira and sent his son in the pouring rain to carry him to their home.
Two other Hutu brothers braved the dangerous streets to bring medicine and bandages.
The killers came looking for Brother Rutaganira.
On locating him at a Hutu home, the leader threatened: “We will solve this problem tomorrow morning.”
All the Hutu brothers knew they could die for their acts of kindness toward a Tutsi.
According to Brother Rutaganira: “If someone was supposed to be killed and you tried to save his life, they definitely would kill you and kill him at the same time.”
As a Hutu, Brother Rwamakuba might have been able to flee and pass the roadblocks, which were manned day and night by armed militias.
But he refused to abandon his wounded Tutsi brother, telling him: “I will not leave you.
Where you die, I will die.”
Early the next day, a battle with opposition soldiers broke out in the streets and the killers fled.
After Brother Rutaganira recovered from his wounds, he returned to find many in his congregation mourning the senseless murder of loved ones and suffering from emotional and physical trauma, including torture and rape.
“The first few months after the genocide were especially difficult,” Brother Rutaganira recalls.
But with love and understanding, Hutu and Tutsi brothers and sisters helped one another to heal.
“They worked hard not to have any hypocrisy or distinction or division among them,” he says.
In April 2019, an exhibition at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, Georgia, told the stories of brothers and sisters who survived and those who died during the genocide in Rwanda
Despite their deep distress, Witnesses throughout Rwanda resumed their Christian meetings and preaching work.
They found many in desperate need of spiritual comfort.
Some people were tormented by the horrific losses they suffered.
Others were tortured by their own consciences because of the terrible deeds they had committed.
Many in Rwanda felt betrayed—by their neighbors, by their leaders, and especially by their churches.
(See the box “ The Churches’ Role in the Genocide in Rwanda.”)
Yet, among Rwandans, the peaceful conduct of Jehovah’s people stood out.
A Catholic Tutsi schoolteacher and her six children were hidden by a Witness family she hardly knew.
She says: “I have a grand appreciation for Jehovah’s Witnesses. . . .
Most people saw that they did not get involved with the genocide.”
After the horrors of the genocide, Rwandans filled the Kingdom Halls.
On average, every publisher conducted three Bible studies.
During the 1996 service year, the number of Witnesses in Rwanda increased more than 60 percent, as people yearned for the healing balm of the Kingdom message.
For many, especially survivors, the 25th anniversary of the genocide is a time of deep reflection.
Brother Rutaganira and other eyewitnesses remain convinced that Christlike love is far more powerful than racial hatred.
“Jesus Christ taught his true followers to love one another more than themselves,” Brother Rutaganira says.
“I am alive today because this kind of love is a reality among Jehovah’s people.”—John 15:13.
“Rwanda is an overwhelmingly Christian country,” states the book Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, with about 90 percent of the population claiming church membership.
According to author Timothy Longman, during the genocide many Hutu—including priests and pastors—killed Tutsi members of their own churches.
He asked: “Why . . . did loyalty to their church and to their fellow believers not prevent Catholics from killing fellow Catholics and Protestants from killing fellow Protestants?”
The role of Rwanda’s churches in the ethnic slaughter has deep historical roots.
For decades before, church leaders had collaborated with political authorities to maintain power, in part, by creating and stoking ethnic tensions.
Hence, Professor Longman wrote: “The Christian message received in Rwanda was not one of ‘love and fellowship.’”
When Hutu extremists took power, clergy support continued.
When the genocide began, religious leaders issued no condemnation but rather urged their members to obey the government.
“Many church members concluded that the church leaders endorsed the killing,” said Professor Longman.
He cited examples of killers who even paused to pray at the altar before going out to kill.
The human rights report Rwanda: Death, Despair, and Defiance concluded: “The genocide in Rwanda has dramatically shown up the moral and spiritual bankruptcy of the hierarchies of all the major churches.”
As Rwandan church leaders went on trial for genocide, one news report observed: “Only Jehovah’s Witnesses are accused of nothing.”
In explaining the Witnesses’ behavior, professor of theology J. J. Carney notes that “nonviolence is a central tenet of their community.”
Genocide scholar John Roth points to the Witnesses’ “refusal to put allegiance to a State ahead of allegiance to God.”
Brother Tharcisse Seminega, whose family survived with the help of Hutu Witnesses, gives yet another reason for the peaceful and life-saving acts of his fellow believers: Christlike love.
“It is only this kind of love that has the power to immunize the heart and mind against the toxin of hatred,” he says.
Widespread heavy rainstorms struck northern Rwanda on October 26 and 29, 2019, affecting several families of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Tragically, the 13-year-old daughter of a Witness couple in the Musanze District of the Northern Province was swept away in the floodwaters and died.
In the Ngororero District of the Western Province, one Witness family suffered the destruction of their home and nine families lost their crops.
The Rwanda branch office is coordinating relief efforts in the region, including material aid and spiritual assistance.
We pray that Jehovah will comfort the hearts of our brothers who are suffering from this tragedy.—2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17.
From August 16 to 18, 2019, our brothers held the first regional convention in Rwandan Sign Language (RWS) in Kigali, Rwanda.
The peak attendance was 620, and 8 deaf individuals were baptized.

Two public officials attended the convention on Sunday: Mr. Jean Damascène Bizimana, a member of the board of directors of the Rwanda National Union of the Deaf, and Mr. Emmanuel Ndayisaba, executive secretary of the National Council of Persons with Disabilities.
Additionally, the Ukwezi newspaper covered the convention program on Sunday and published a positive report online.

Mr. Bizimana commented: “This convention was excellent! To see deaf people from different areas of the country united together — thank you.
We very much thank Jehovah’s Witnesses for supporting communication for the deaf.
Government authorities should come to see such a unifying event and imitate it.”
Over the past two years, there have been two additional milestones in the RWS field.
In September 2017, the Rwanda branch held the first Pioneer Service School in RWS.
One year later, in September 2018, the branch officially began translating our publications into RWS.
Brother Jean d’Amour Habiyaremye, who served as the branch representative for the sign-language convention, stated: “We are very happy to see the progress in the RWS field, which includes this recent regional convention.
The theme of the program, ‘Love Never Fails!’ is seen in practice with the way Jehovah’s Witnesses display love to all people, including deaf individuals.”
The progress in this sign-language field gives clear evidence of Jehovah’s continued rich blessing!—Psalm 67:1.
On the morning of August 14, 2017, flooding and landslides severely damaged shops, roads, and homes throughout Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital city.
Over 400 people are confirmed dead and approximately 600 more are missing.
Officials fear that additional rains forecasted could cause further devastation.
The branch office in Sierra Leone reports that no Jehovah’s Witnesses were killed or injured in this disaster.
However, two families were displaced.
Local congregation elders are providing pastoral support to their fellow Witnesses.
Additionally, the elders have been distributing information outlining safety precautions in the event of further flooding.

Jehovah’s Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Kwanyama at a regional convention in Ondangwa, Namibia, on August 16, 2019.
Brother Franco Dagostini, a member of the South Africa Branch Committee, released the Bible on the first day of the convention at the Ondangwa Trade Fair Hall.
One member of the translation team says: “The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures will help people read and understand the Bible’s message more clearly.
Our brothers and sisters will be happy to see Jehovah’s name where it ought to be.”
In the South Africa branch territory, there are approximately 490 Kwanyama-speaking publishers.
These preach to an estimated 1.4 million people who speak Kwanyama, primarily in Angola and Namibia.
The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures has now been translated in whole or in part into 184 languages, including 25 complete revisions based on the 2013 edition.
We are joyful knowing our brothers and sisters will use this Bible to share God’s Word with many in the Kwanyama-language field.—Acts 2:37.
On September 6, 2019, at the international convention in Johannesburg, South Africa, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was released in Venda, Afrikaans, and Xhosa, languages spoken by over 16 million people.
Brother Anthony Morris, a member of the Governing Body, announced the release to an audience of 36,865 people gathered in the FNB Stadium.
An additional 51,229 people were tied in at eight other venues, including locations in Lesotho, Namibia, and Saint Helena.
Commenting on the unique features of the Bibles, one translator excitedly said: “We are all going to start our Bible reading afresh with the language that touches our hearts!” Another translator noted: “Most importantly, [the newly released Bible] will help us to draw closer to Jehovah because it uses God’s name repeatedly.”
The Bibles will also greatly enhance our brothers’ ministry. One member of the Xhosa translation team stated: “The revised New World Translation will help in the ministry.
People will hear clearly what the Bible teaches without having each and every word explained.”
An Afrikaans translator added: “Now you can just read the scripture and the Bible explains itself.”
We rejoice that our brothers have easy-to-read Bibles that will help them to draw closer to our God.—James 4:8.
Heavy rains hit the eastern coast of South Africa in late April 2019.
The prolonged rains caused flooding and mudslides in several areas in and around Durban, KwaZulu-Natal province.
News reports indicate that at least 70 people have died.
The South Africa branch reports that no brothers or sisters were injured or killed.
However, the homes of at least 19 families were damaged by mudslides or flooding.
Floodwaters also damaged at least three Kingdom Halls.
Under the direction of the Disaster Relief Committee, Local Design/Construction volunteers are investigating the extent of the damage to each home.
Where the safety of the brothers is at risk, arrangements are being made to accommodate them elsewhere.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to support our brothers and sisters in South Africa as they face these challenging circumstances.—Psalm 34:19.
Heavy and prolonged rainfall in Togo during the 2019 rainy season has led to significant flooding on the outskirts of Lomé, Togo.
Two hundred and fifty-seven publishers from seven different congregations have been affected.
Relief efforts are underway.
In some of the affected areas, water levels in buildings reached up to one meter (3 ft 3 in), forcing 51 of our brothers and sisters to evacuate their homes.
Publishers nearby have opened their homes to care for the needs of those displaced.
Floodwaters contaminated some of the water sources in the area.
The Benin Branch Committee, which oversees the work in Togo, has arranged to distribute necessary relief supplies through the circuit overseer and local elders.
These supplies include water purification tablets, disinfectant, and bleach.
We pray for Jehovah’s blessing on our brothers in Togo as they demonstrate self-sacrificing love for one another.—John 13:34, 35.
On March 17, 2019, Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the Governing Body, released the revised edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in the Shona language at a special event held at the Harare Assembly Hall in Zimbabwe.
The release of the Bible is the culmination of a three-year translation project.
Nearly 2,500 brothers and sisters were present at the Assembly Hall for the Bible release.
An additional 43,000 were tied in to the event from 295 Kingdom Halls and 4 Assembly Halls.
One brother said: “I look forward to using the revised Bible in the ministry.
The language is simple and refreshing, which encourages one to read more.
We thank Jehovah for this gift.”
This edition will benefit the 38,000 publishers who serve in the Shona field.
Additionally, it will assist them in preaching to the over 9,000,000 individuals who speak the language, approximately 80 percent of Zimbabwe’s population.
Every Bible release gives evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the worldwide translation efforts.
We are happy that his Word is being made available in the native languages of more and more readers.—Acts 2:8.
In August 2018, construction of a new branch office began in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The facility will include an office building with 136 workstations and two residential buildings with 98 rooms.
Unlike the current branch complex, which is spread over several properties, the newly designed facility will centralize operations in one structure, thus improving the efficiency of the work.
The photo gallery below is a look at the start of the construction.
The property totals 8,524 square meters (91,758 sq ft) and is located outside of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina.
From October 6 to 18, 2018, our brothers engaged in a special public witnessing campaign in connection with the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Athletes from Saint Kitts and Nevis visit the carts.
Hundreds of pieces of literature were distributed each day during the campaign.
Over 4,000 athletes from 206 countries participated in this year’s Summer Youth Olympic Games, which is considered the world’s largest multi-sport competition for young athletes between the ages of 15 and 18.
So that the many international athletes and visitors to the city could have the opportunity to hear the Bible’s message, more than 6,400 Jehovah’s Witnesses shared in the campaign.
Our brothers employed 390 literature display carts in almost 100 locations.
Since the event is oriented to young people, the brothers featured the Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work volumes and the brochure Answers to 10 Questions Young People Ask.
Literature was available in multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Argentinean Sign Language. An average of 790 publications were distributed every day of the campaign.
The brothers and sisters who participated in the campaign were happy to share the Bible’s hope with young and old alike.—Psalm 110:3.
Sister Cecilia Alvarez, from Argentina, has dealt with severe health problems her entire life.
Her first procedure was when she was only 16 days old.
On May 18, 1994, doctors in Argentina repaired birth defects on her spine and spinal membranes.
Since that day 25 years ago, Cecilia has endured a remarkable 42 additional surgeries, the majority of which were when she was a child.
The most recent procedure was earlier this year to repair her left hip.
Like all of her prior surgeries, this one was successfully performed without a blood transfusion.
1999: Five-year-old Cecilia at Juan P. Garrahan Children’s Hospital
Cecilia admits: “It has been very stressful to have my body exposed to so many surgeries and treatments.”
However, she has tried to remain positive and has relied on Jehovah.
Additionally, she, along with the support of her parents, has made every effort to listen to the doctors’ recommendations.
“To prepare my body in advance for surgery was a key point,” states Cecilia.
“This included taking iron, folic acid, erythropoietin treatment, and a diet with plenty of iron-rich foods, which increased red blood cell production.”
Describing the medical teams that have assisted her over the years, Cecilia acknowledges: “I highly value their work, not only because they saved my life but also because they showed respect for my refusal of blood transfusions.”
Dr. Ernesto Bersusky, retired spinal pathologist
The clinicians that worked with Cecilia have expressed a mutual respect for her and the brothers who assisted her.
Dr. Ernesto Bersusky, former chief of spinal pathology at Juan P. Garrahan Children’s Hospital in Buenos Aires, who was involved in a number of Cecilia’s major spinal surgeries, recalls: “In my dealings with Cecilia, I have seen how determined she is and how clearly she can explain her beliefs.
I spoke with her many times, explaining what I was going to do and reassuring her that no blood transfusion would be administered.”
Dr. Susana Ciruzzi, lawyer and bioethicist
Dr. Susana Ciruzzi, a lawyer and member of the bioethics committee at Juan P. Garrahan Children’s Hospital states: “There has been a coordinated effort between Jehovah’s Witnesses and the medical community.
We have worked together with Jehovah’s Witnesses and have committed ourselves to evolve—not only our minds but also our techniques and scientific knowledge—thus developing alternative methods to blood transfusion.”
In addition to Cecilia’s expert clinicians, she credits her success to the support of fellow believers, stating: “I deeply appreciate the work of the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) and the Patient Visitation Group.
Their self-sacrificing and unconditional availability, despite having family and other responsibilities, is a priceless treasure.”
Though she experiences persistent physical pain and is confined to a wheelchair, Cecilia, now 25 years old, is well-known for her positive attitude. In fact, she says: “I believe that these traumatic experiences have helped me to refine my personality and develop Christian qualities.”
July 2019: Cecilia in the ministry with a fellow pioneer sister
Cecilia continues: “After one of the surgeries, a member of the HLC visited me and cited Proverbs 10:22: ‘It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich, and he adds no [permanent] pain with it.’
That text has stuck forever in my mind and heart.”
On May 1, 2019, our sister Cecilia received a very special blessing when she was appointed to serve as a regular pioneer.
Clearly, Jehovah has comforted and strengthened our dear sister.
As a result, she, in turn, joyfully shares the comforting message of God’s Word with others.
We trust Jehovah will continue to comfort all of us in our various trials just as he has done for Cecilia.—2 Corinthians 1:4.
A landslide destroyed a large part of the San Jorge Kantutani neighborhood of La Paz, Bolivia, on April 30, 2019.
Hundreds of people were displaced.
While none of our brothers died or were injured, the Bolivia branch reports that two of our brothers’ homes were completely destroyed in the landslide.
Additionally, 11 other Witness families live in the affected area, but their homes sustained little or no damage.
Under the direction of the branch office, the Disaster Relief Committee, circuit overseers, and local elders are providing spiritual and practical support.
The brothers in the affected areas remain alert to the continued threat of landslides if there is more rainfall.
We are thankful that our brothers were not injured and are receiving the assistance they need.—Galatians 6:10.

Local Experience: Mrs. Maria Luiza Gonçalves, communication director of the São Paulo Zoo, who welcomed delegates, said: “I have worked with a lot of events here at the zoo.
We receive tourists year-round, but I have never seen such a large, warm, and organized group.
You have a lot of love to give! We can see the love you show in the hugs, in the affection, and in the songs.”
Since January 18, 2020, the Brazilian states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais have been experiencing an extraordinary amount of rainfall, which has caused destructive flooding.
The floodwaters rushing through the streets have damaged homes, swept away cars, and uprooted trees.
According to authorities, thousands have had to evacuate their homes and more than 60 people have died.
In the towns of Iconha and Alfredo Chaves, the flooding damaged nine homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses, affecting 27 of our brothers and sisters.
Thankfully, none of our fellow worshippers were injured or killed.
Some 100 Witnesses from the region volunteered to assist the brothers affected by the flooding.
Under the supervision of the elders, brothers donated food, water, and clothing.
They also helped to clean and remove mud from the homes of both our brothers and their non-Witness neighbors.
None of our brothers and sisters were injured or killed.
However, five Kingdom Halls were damaged and about 50 Witness families had to evacuate their homes.
Some brothers were trapped by the rising floodwaters and had to be rescued by boat from the second floor of their homes.
All of the evacuated brothers and sisters were accommodated by fellow Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Disaster Relief Committees have been appointed in both Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais to coordinate the relief work.
The Disaster Relief Committees are working with circuit overseers and local elders to care for the physical and spiritual needs of the affected publishers.
We continue to pray for our brothers affected by the flooding.
We thank Jehovah for giving them strength, comfort, and practical help through our Christian brotherhood.—Psalm 28:7.
On Friday, January 25, 2019, a mining dam collapsed in the city of Brumadinho, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, causing a deadly mudslide.
At least 150 people were killed, and an additional 182 people are still missing.
There are two congregations in Brumadinho, with about 180 Witnesses, many of whom work for the mining company.
Ten brothers were working at the dam when it ruptured.
While nine are confirmed unharmed, sadly, one brother, who serves as an elder, is still missing.
Additionally, at least five Witness families had to evacuate their homes and one home was completely destroyed.
A member of the Brazil Branch Committee and circuit overseers in the region have visited those affected by the tragedy to encourage them spiritually and offer practical assistance.
We pray that our heavenly Father will continue to supply the needed comfort and support to all those affected by this tragedy.—Romans 15:5.
In the early morning of December 18, a fire blazed through the city of Manaus, Brazil, destroying at least 600 homes.
Although there were no reported fatalities, 4 people were injured and more than 2,000 were displaced.
The Brazil branch reports that no brothers or sisters were killed or injured by the fire.
However, 10 of our brothers’ homes were destroyed, resulting in the displacement of 18 publishers and their non-Witness relatives.
Under the direction of the branch, a Disaster Relief Committee is caring for the needs of the publishers who have been impacted.
We are confident that our brothers and sisters affected by this fire in Brazil will continue to trust in Jehovah, our “secure refuge in times of distress.”—Psalm 9:9, 10.
In a unanimous decision released on May 31, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the disfellowshipping arrangement should remain free from court intervention.
We rejoice in this vindication of Jehovah’s righteous standards.—Isaiah 33:22.
In the case of Highwood Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously decided on May 31, 2018, that “religious groups are free to determine their own membership and rules,” thus recognizing that the disfellowshipping arrangement should remain free from court intervention.
The Supreme Court of Canada building (pictured left) in Ottawa.
The Court concluded that the Witnesses’ procedures for reviewing a serious sin “are not adversarial, but are meant to restore the member to the Congregation,” and it ruled that courts cannot intervene in such private, ecclesiastical matters.
In delineating the reasons for the judgment, Supreme Court Justice Malcolm Rowe explained on behalf of the nine-judge panel: “The procedural rules of a particular religious group may involve the interpretation of religious doctrine, such as in this case.
The courts have neither legitimacy nor institutional capacity to deal with contentious matters of religious doctrine.”
Philip Brumley, general counsel for Jehovah’s Witnesses, states: “With this decision, the Supreme Court of Canada joins high courts in Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Peru, Poland, and the United States in recognizing our legal right to follow the Scriptural precedent in determining who qualifies to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”—1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 John 9-11.
The 27 publishers in the Iqaluit Congregation, in Canada’s Arctic Archipelago, came together for the Memorial via videoconference, of the congregation’s 55 Bible students, 12 attended the virtual observance and were especially grateful that they could do so.
For most of the students, attending the Memorial in person would be a challenge, if not impossible.
They live in remote parts of the congregation’s territory, which spans some two million square kilometers (772,204 sq mi) from Kimmirut to Grise Fiord—Canada’s northernmost community.
“This year, for the first time, we were able to have our Bible students join us for the Memorial program.
One Bible student in Grise Fiord invited four others to tie in, so a total of five people at the very top of the world joined us for the Memorial,” states Brother Isaac Demeester, an elder in the Iqaluit Congregation.
The unusual circumstances brought on by restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic have helped many brothers and sisters in the Iqaluit Congregation to see the benefits of being adaptable.
Sister Kathy Burechailo recalls: “We reached out to people across the eastern Arctic by phone.
I had some amazing calls with people in the remotest parts of our territory. People are at home and they need comfort.”
“Being so isolated has been particularly stressful for us in Iqaluit as we cope with financial setbacks and uncertainties of this pandemic,” states Sister Laura McGregor.
“It was our first time making the Memorial bread for our family.
We enjoyed a wonderful time together.
It helped us to appreciate more deeply how simple a ceremony it is, and what a blessing it was to have something so simple and accessible.”
Brother Demeester concludes: “Although the COVID-19 outbreak has distanced us in many ways, it has been amazing to see how during this Memorial season our congregation has grown even closer.
This year’s Memorial has been life changing!”
The Iqaluit Congregation anticipates building their own Kingdom Hall in the near future, when circumstances allow.
In the meantime, we know that Jehovah will bless their diligent efforts to bring the good news to the northernmost regions of Canada—one of the most distant parts of the earth!—Acts 1:8.
Thousands of people in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec have been displaced because of flooding.
In the province of Quebec alone, some 9,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.
The Canada branch reports that in Quebec, a total of 44 of our brothers’ homes sustained damage.
In New Brunswick and Ontario, no damage has been reported as yet but flooding continues.
The circuit overseers in the affected areas of Quebec are working with the local elders to shepherd the publishers.
Additionally, a branch representative visited the worst-hit areas to provide spiritual support.
In the Beauce region, brothers and sisters have already completed the initial cleanup and removed mud from 20 flooded homes of our brothers.
A Disaster Relief Committee was set up in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac to assist those whose homes were damaged.
We pray that our brothers who have been impacted by the recent flooding will continue to trust in Jehovah, who is ‘their strength and their might.’—Exodus 15:2.
Brother Jean-Yves and his wife, Vasthie Mudaheranwa, are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic in Montreal, Canada.
Brother Mudaheranwa is a respiratory therapist at a community hospital, and Sister Mudaheranwa works as a nurse at a designated COVID-19 treatment center.
During this time of great emotional tension, they are drawing strength from Jehovah and benefiting from “the good condition of the heart” Jehovah promised.—Isaiah 65:14.
“Many of my colleagues seem really scared, like I’ve never seen before,” Brother Mudaheranwa says.
“Personal study helps a lot,” Sister Mudaheranwa says: “We reflect on the sign of the last days, and we remind ourselves that Jehovah is with us and will not let us down.
Prayer plays a big part too.
Before I go to work and start my day, I pray and I have peace.”
The Mudaheranwas participate in a congregation meeting
“I’m from Rwanda, and I lived through the genocide,” Brother Mudaheranwa explains.
“In Canada, we have never had anything like that, so sometimes we can forget that we are living in the last days.
I have to admit, that even for me, the day of Jehovah wasn’t always as close in mind as it should be.
The pandemic has strengthened my conviction that we are living in the last days, and it has strengthened my faith in the Bible and in the Bible’s prophecies.”
Brother and Sister Mudaheranwa’s conviction is being echoed around the world as Jehovah’s people continue to have peace during this crisis.—Isaiah 48:18.

Local Experiences: “Everything that the [Jehovah’s Witnesses’] convention committee talked about as to what they would bring to the venue—the level of service they would bring to the venue—has come true,” stated Laura Purdy, general manager of sales and events at Exhibition Place.
“We did a little bit of research on our own and spoke to other venues that the convention had been at, and in fact, they had the same experience we are having now.”
Ms. Purdy continued: “The environment has been warm and welcoming.
I would highly encourage any other venue organizer to welcome the JW convention to their city.”
The certificate from the Paulo Freire Educational Center recognizing the benefits of the Bible education classes held in the Valledupar prison facility.
For over 20 years, our brothers in Colombia have been offering free Bible education to prisoners.
On November 30, 2018, the Paulo Freire Educational Center presented a certificate of recognition to Jehovah’s Witnesses for their Bible education work in a prison facility in the city of Valledupar.
Currently, 50 inmates participate in the Bible classes.
Throughout Colombia, Jehovah’s Witnesses hold classes in 65 prisons, where they conduct 782 Bible studies.
A total of 60 individuals have progressed to baptism since 1996.
Néver Antonio Cavadía studied the Bible while in prison and now serves as a congregation elder.
He is pictured here with his wife, Lety Cavadía.
Néver Antonio Cavadía accepted a Bible study while in prison and was baptized in 1998.
He was later released from Valledupar prison in 2007.
Commenting on the benefits of his education, he said: “Bible principles protected and helped me to have practical wisdom while I was in prison.
They also motivated me to make big changes in my life and maintain hope.”
Worldwide, our efforts to reach those in prisons are in harmony with Jehovah’s will “that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”—1 Timothy 2:4.
On January 27, 2019, a tornado pummeled Havana, the capital of Cuba.
With wind gusts up to 322 kilometers per hour (200 mph)—making it the strongest storm to hit the island in nearly 80 years—the tornado carved an 11-kilometer (7-mi) path of destruction that damaged buildings and caused flooding.
At least 4 people have been killed, and 195 were injured.
No brothers or sisters were injured or killed by the storm.
However, 26 homes of our brothers sustained damage, 3 of which are used to hold congregation meetings.
Arrangements are underway to care for the needed repair work.
Traveling overseers have been providing spiritual support to fellow worshippers who have endured the tornado and its aftereffects.
We pray that Jehovah will grant our brothers and sisters peace as they recover from this disaster.—Numbers 6:26.
On Friday, May 18, 2018, a Boeing 737 crashed shortly after takeoff from Havana, Cuba.
Of the 113 people on board, only one person survived, making this the country’s worst airline accident in many years.
Sadly, included in the death toll was a family of three of Jehovah’s Witnesses (a father, mother, and 22-year-old son).
A funeral was held for the family on Saturday, May 26, 2018.
Along with the emotional and spiritual support that is being provided by the local elders to the friends and family of the victims, local authorities have also kindly offered practical assistance.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to bring ‘comfort to all who mourn’ during this difficult time.—Isaiah 61:1, 2.

Local Experience: José Francisco Cevallos, president of the Barcelona Sporting Club that owns the stadium, stated: “We have never had issues related to your conventions, neither this one nor in previous years.
That speaks highly of your good behavior and the orderliness that we see in all your conventions.
It is not an easy task, yet it’s in your culture to organize and thoroughly prepare for all your events.
You are good people—very educated, well-mannered, and well-organized.
We strongly recommend any city and country to host Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
Our brothers and sisters around the world continue to adapt their ministry as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.
Publishers in Ecuador are having success using a variety of preaching methods to reach people with the good news.
In the city of Ambato, a seven-year-old publisher, along with her mother, sent text messages to her school teachers.
Some of these read: “Good morning, teacher.
I’m writing to send you a comforting message because of the times we are living in.
The Bible offers us a better future in Revelation 21:4.
I’m sending you a link with more information.”
One teacher wrote back: “Thank you, my lovely girl.
Even at your young age, your words are very wise.”
Another teacher thanked her and asked if there is a digital version of My Book of Bible Stories.
The teacher explained that she used to have a copy but loaned it to another student.
The young publisher explained to her teacher that she could download the book from jw.org.
A married couple in the city of Quevedo searched through their contact lists to find people who are not Witnesses and sent this text message to them: “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Because of the crisis that is affecting the country and the entire world, we aren’t able to preach from house to house, but we would like very much to talk to you by videoconference.”
The majority agreed to such a meeting.
One contact, a woman who had not been receptive when Witnesses preached to her in the past, thanked the couple and commended their initiative.
The woman explained that she feels stressed over the current situation.
The couple sent the woman the Awake!, No. 1 2020, entitled “Find Relief From Stress,” in PDF format.
In a subsequent conversation, the woman expressed her appreciation for the magazine and revealed that she had read it multiple times.
A deaf sister named Johana, from the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas, “wrote” a letter using pictures.
She then took a photograph of it and sent it via text message to all of her contacts who are deaf.
However, among the recipients was a hearing woman.
The woman quickly wrote back asking questions.
Since Johana didn’t understand the questions, a hearing pioneer sister named Rhonda followed up on the interest.
The interested woman explained to Rhonda that the drawings that Johana had sent to her caught her attention.
She asked whether there are other verses in the Bible that also speak about what is happening on the earth.
Rhonda read to her Luke 21:10, 11 and sent the woman links to the videos Why Does God Allow Suffering? and Why Did God Create the Earth? The woman is willing to have another conversation.
Just as the apostle Paul continued “bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God” while he was imprisoned, our brothers continue taking advantage of every opportunity to preach, even though they cannot leave their homes.—Acts 28:23.
^ par. 7 Since many deaf people struggle to understand written text, in the sign-language field a number of publishers draw illustrations to represent concepts rather than write out words.
On Sunday, June 3, 2018, Guatemala’s Volcan de Fuego, or “volcano of fire,“ erupted, spewing a river of molten lava and sending plumes of smoke nearly six miles (9 km) high.
There are at least ten congregations in the affected region.
Thankfully, none of our brothers and sisters have been harmed, although eight have been evacuated as a preventative safety measure.
In the spirit of 2 Corinthians 8:14, 15, neighboring circuits have offered supplies, shelter, and transportation.
On Saturday, October 6, 2018, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck the northern region of Haiti, killing 17 and injuring over 300.
No deaths have been reported among the brothers; however, two publishers sustained minor injuries.
Initial reports from the circuit overseers indicate that 44 homes and 4 Kingdom Halls have been damaged.
In the city of Port-de-Paix, about 50 of our brothers and their immediate family members have been displaced because the safety of their homes has been compromised.
These families are being cared for by their local congregation.
A member of the Haiti Branch Committee along with two brothers working with the Local Design/Construction Department visited the affected area to assess the damage and to provide encouragement.
A Disaster Relief Committee has been established to organize necessary relief aid.
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with our brothers in Haiti.
Tropical Storm Lidia hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula on Friday, September 1.
Although weakening to a depression by Saturday, the storm dropped about 27 inches (69 cm) of rain, the largest amount reported since 1933.
At least five people died in the storm.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses located in Mexico City, reports that one Witness was killed when she was swept away by rushing water as she walked home.
Three others were also caught in the floodwaters, but were rescued.
Additionally, eight homes were severely damaged by the storm.
All the affected victims are being cared for by their family members or by local Witnesses.
The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses coordinates disaster relief efforts from their world headquarters, using funds donated to the Witnesses’ global ministry work.

On September 19, 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico, killing over 200 people.
Initial reports have been received from the Central America branch office with the following information. Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that one of our sisters in Mexico City was killed in the quake.
Additionally, one sister is still missing after her building collapsed.
In the city of Puebla, a sister was severely injured, and in the State of Mexico, another sister was hospitalized with injuries.
The branch office had to be temporarily evacuated but has returned to normal operations.
There were no injuries and there was no structural damage to the facility.
We continue to pray for our brothers and sisters during this difficult time, knowing that Jehovah will support them and is aware of their “deep distress.”—Psalm 31:7.

On September 14, 2017, the southern Pacific coast of Mexico was hit by Hurricane Max, which eventually weakened into a tropical storm.
The hurricane brought strong winds and rains that caused damaging floods.
Its impact on local communities is still being assessed.
Sadly, however, it has been confirmed that one of our brothers was killed during the storm as he was attempting to assist his neighbor.
The branch office in Mexico is coordinating relief activities and working with local congregations to provide support to those affected by the hurricane.

Two powerful earthquakes struck Guatemala and Mexico in 2017.
In December 2018, our brothers completed their vast relief efforts in the region.
The Central America branch began the relief work by organizing several meetings to encourage the brothers and sisters affected by the disasters.
These meetings were held in the states of Chiapas, Morelos, Oaxaca, and Puebla, as well as in Mexico City.
A total of 39 Disaster Relief Committees worked under the direction of the Branch Committee to organize the rebuilding work.
A member of the Central America Branch Committee, Jesse Pérez, meets with affected publishers in the state of Morelos.
Two brothers work on the roof frame of an Assembly Hall that was rebuilt during the relief work.
In Mexico, over 42,000 publishers from ten different states volunteered to assist with the relief efforts.
The brothers and sisters rebuilt 619 homes, 5 Kingdom Halls, and 2 Assembly Halls.
They also repaired another 502 homes and 53 Kingdom Halls.
In Guatemala, an additional ten homes were rebuilt.
Among the Witnesses who received assistance were the Hernández and Santiago families.
The Hernández family standing in front of their home, which was rebuilt by relief workers.
The Hernández family lives in the city of Chalco, just 40 kilometers (25 mi) outside of Mexico City.
The earthquake that struck on September 19, 2017, damaged their home beyond repair.
Sister Ana María Hernández explains: “Throughout this ordeal, we never lacked a single thing.
Our brothers took very good care of us.
I still remember the site where our house formerly stood, with 50 or more volunteers working to build our new home.
To this day, our neighbors are amazed at what our brothers did for us.” In addition to this practical assistance, a representative of the Central America branch visited the Hernández family and provided Bible-based encouragement.
The Santiago family pictured in front of their new home.
The Santiago family, who lives in the city of Juchitán in the state of Oaxaca, was affected by the earthquake that struck on September 7, 2017.
The damage to their home rendered it uninhabitable.
However, in less than six months, relief workers built them a new home.
The father of the family, Brother Victor Santiago, states: “I was so impressed by how quickly Jehovah’s organization provided us with support.
I saw that Jehovah had everything under control.” Brother Jesse Pérez, a member of the Central America Branch Committee, comments: “The destruction caused by the two earthquakes was widespread.
However, the long-term relief work that followed provided an opportunity for brothers and sisters to show their volunteer spirit.
Numerous publishers assisted, demonstrating their brotherly love.
December 1 marks the start of a large-scale relief project, which will cost an estimated $10 million.
The work includes rebuilding nearly 500 homes and 16 Kingdom Halls, and repairing numerous other structures affected by two earthquakes, which struck Guatemala and Mexico in September.
MEXICO CITY—The Central America Branch Committee will initiate a large-scale rebuilding work in Guatemala and Mexico on December 1, 2017, as part of their ongoing relief efforts following the two earthquakes that struck in September.
The branch organized initial relief efforts immediately following the quakes, providing water, food, medicine, and clothing to our affected brothers.
The next wave of relief work will focus on reconstructing Assembly Halls, Kingdom Halls, and homes of our brothers.
In the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, there were 655 brothers and sisters displaced after the magnitude 8.2 earthquake that occurred on September 7.
The planned relief work for the two states includes rebuilding 315 homes and 15 Kingdom Halls.
Additionally, damaged structures scheduled to be repaired include 1,039 homes, 108 Kingdom Halls, and 3 Assembly Halls.
In Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Morelos, and Puebla, the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck on September 19 displaced 463 brothers and sisters.
A total of 158 homes will be rebuilt, and an additional 600 homes, 39 Kingdom Halls, and one Assembly Hall will be repaired.
In Guatemala, the September 7 earthquake displaced 36 brothers and sisters.
In the coming months, construction servants and local volunteers will rebuild nine homes and one Kingdom Hall.
They will also repair 20 homes and 4 Kingdom Halls.
The Branch Committee estimates that the relief work, which involves 39 disaster relief committees, will cost nearly $10 million and will span five to six months.
Some 30 construction servants have made plans to move to the affected areas, and an additional 970 have volunteered to assist with the rebuilding work.
We are confident that Jehovah will bless the work and volunteer spirit of all who “share in the relief ministry” on behalf of our brothers in the affected areas.—2 Corinthians 8:4.

The whole city is aware of it.”"
Late Thursday, September 7, a magnitude 8.2 earthquake struck off Mexico’s southern Pacific coast.
The quake is the strongest to hit Mexico in a century, killing at least 45 people.
Sadly, we have received confirmation that one of our brothers and two of our sisters were among those who died.
Additionally, initial reports indicate that many homes of the brothers and several Kingdom Halls have been damaged or destroyed.
Two Assembly Halls in Chiapas State were also damaged.
Assessments are ongoing.

MEXICO CITY—On December 4, 2017, a mob in Tuxpan de Bolaños, a small town located in the mountains of Jalisco, Mexico, attacked 12 of our brothers of the indigenous Huichol community and another 36 people who associate with them, banishing them from their homes.
The assailants were angered that the Witnesses would not participate in traditional Huichol religious rites.
As victims of religious persecution, our brothers have appealed to the legal authorities for relief.
Our brothers’ possessions were either stolen or thrown outside.
Mexican national authorities respect Huichol traditions and culture to the extent of granting this society a certain degree of autonomy.
At the request of the traditional Huichol government, enforcers violently removed our brothers from their homes, which they subsequently ransacked, stealing doors, windows, and roofs.
Any items that were not stolen were thrown into a ditch.
The brothers were then taken to a forest and told that they would be killed if they attempted to return.

A representative from the branch office in Mexico traveled to meet those displaced to give spiritual support and to arrange for housing.
Legal representatives for Jehovah’s Witnesses met with the director of the Jalisco government, the human rights prosecutor, the regional prosecutor, and the director of attention for crime victims.
These legal authorities are now investigating these crimes.
Brother Gamaliel Camarillo, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico, explains: “We are truly appalled that our fellow worshippers, who live peacefully in their community and respect local customs, have been attacked simply because they will not participate in religious rites that offend their conscience.
It is hoped that the local authorities will swiftly address this religiously driven persecution.” We pray for our brothers who have lost their homes and belongings, and we are confident that Jehovah will continue to provide the needed assistance through his organization.—Isaiah 32:2.

On October 23, Mexico was hit with two natural disasters, Tropical Storm Vicente and Hurricane Willa.
Vicente caused severe flooding and mudslides in southern Mexico that killed 11 people.
Willa battered the Pacific coast of Mexico with heavy rainfall and wind speeds measured at 193 kilometers per hour (120 mph), forcing 4,250 people to evacuate from areas impacted by the hurricane.
The Central America branch, which coordinates the work in Mexico, reports that no brothers or sisters lost their lives or were injured in either of these storms.
However, in the state of Nayarit, 118 publishers were evacuated from their homes to higher ground.
In Sinaloa, one Kingdom Hall and the homes of several brothers were flooded.
The homes of five Witness families in Michoacán were also flooded.
Local brothers and sisters have already cleaned the flooded homes and Kingdom Hall and made necessary repairs.
We pray that our brothers and sisters in Mexico affected by these storms continue to endure, remembering the hope we all share of a future in which natural disasters will no longer occur.—2 Corinthians 6:4.
Jehovah’s Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Guarani at a regional convention that was broadcast from the Bethel auditorium located in Capiatá, Paraguay, on August 16, 2019.
Brother Daniel González, a member of the Paraguay Branch Committee, released the Bible on the first day of the convention.
An additional 13 venues were tied in to the program by video streaming, making the grand total attendance for the Bible release 5,631.
Although Spanish is widely spoken throughout Paraguay, an estimated 90 percent of the population also speaks Guarani, an indigenous language.
This makes Paraguay the only country in Latin America where the majority speaks the same indigenous language.
One of the individuals who assisted with the translation effort observed that, prior to this translation, many brothers and sisters would pray to Jehovah in their mother tongue of Guarani.
He explains: “Jehovah will now speak to us in Guarani. We already feel that Jehovah loves and dignifies us. Now, I feel more than ever that Jehovah is my Father.”
Without a doubt, the Bible in Guarani will have a positive effect on the 4,934 Guarani-speaking publishers in Paraguay, helping them strengthen their appreciation for Jehovah and his organization.
We are confident that this translation will help readers benefit from the precious thoughts of our God.​
Since the end of April 2019, heavy rains in Paraguay have caused devastating flooding along the Paraguay River.
At least six people have died in the floods.
The Paraguay branch reports that this disaster has affected 137 of our brothers in several cities.
In the capital city of Asunción, floodwaters broke through the wall of a Kingdom Hall that was being used to hold a class of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
Thankfully, no one was injured.
The branch has already sent provisions such as food, water, and other basic necessities to the impacted brothers and sisters.
Since the flooding is ongoing, the branch is actively monitoring the situation and will continue to provide needed support, both physical and spiritual.
We pray for our brothers and sisters affected by these floods in Paraguay. We know that Jehovah will be their “fortified place” during this difficult time.
From May 1 to August 31, 2019, the Peru branch organized a special preaching campaign in an effort to share the Bible’s message with Peruvians who speak Aymara, an indigenous language.
The campaign was a resounding success.
Participants placed 7,893 pieces of literature and showed our videos some 2,500 times.
By the end of the campaign, our brothers had started 381 Bible studies.
There are approximately 450,000 Aymara speakers in Peru, almost 300,000 of whom live in the region of Puno.
Currently, there are 331 Aymara-speaking publishers, who meet in seven congregations and eight groups.
Since the territory is so vast compared to the number of publishers in Peru, Aymara-speaking publishers from Chile joined in the campaign effort.
To reach Aymara-speaking residents, at times our brothers had to climb up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) above sea level and preach in temperatures of zero degrees Celsius (32ºF).
One group traveled several hours to an area where people from a nearby town were gathered for a funeral.
The brothers and sisters were able to share with them the Bible’s hope for the dead.
The local authorities and the grieving family thanked the brothers and sisters because of the effort they expended to share the Bible’s comforting message.
In another area, our brothers and sisters found a group of people who met together twice a week to study the Bible.
The publishers discovered that the group was using the books The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived and My Book of Bible Stories, which they had received from a relative who lived in Bolivia.
Once the group found out that our organization published these books, many of them began to study the Bible with the brothers and to attend our meetings.
Brother Albert Condor, an elder who took the lead in one group, commented: “My wife and I feel really happy to have been able to participate in this campaign.
It has strengthened our faith in Jehovah because when we started traveling to the town, we weren’t sure exactly how we would get there, since the journey was difficult.
When we arrived, we prayed to Jehovah to help us find a place to stay. He did.
Those prayers have strengthened me, and seeing the trust that other brothers have in Jehovah has strengthened me as well.”
The brothers and sisters are happy to share life-giving waters of truth from God’s Word with the Aymara-speaking people in Puno, Peru.
Representatives from the Thailand Embassy in Peru visited the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses located in Lima, the capital city, on June 26, 2018.
Their purpose was to thank our brothers for the assistance given to Thai citizens in a Peruvian prison.
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Peru have been visiting prisons in their Bible education work since 2007.
But beginning in 2013, the brothers have been visiting a prison that includes Thai inmates.
Impressed by the displays of personal interest, the Thai consul contacted the branch office to arrange a visit.
Brothers and sisters leaving a prison where they helped inmates learn more about the Bible.
The delegation from the embassy included Mr. Angkura Kulvanij, chargé d’affaires a.i.; Mr. Pathompong Singthong, first secretary/consul; and Ms. Pradthana Pongudom, consular assistant.
As they toured the branch, accompanied by members of the Branch Committee, they were familiarized with the branch’s extensive translation efforts, which include translating our publications into nine indigenous languages.
Representatives of the Thailand Embassy watch as a brother translates our publications into Peruvian Sign Language.
An official letter from the embassy to the branch office expressed “sincere appreciation and admiration” for our brothers’ diligence in caring for “the disadvantaged and vulnerable persons in Peru, regardless of their faith or culture.”
The embassy went on to commend the “tireless efforts and contributions of the staff of the Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Peru branch, to help alleviate the difficulties and improve the quality of life of the detained Thai citizens.”
The experience of our brothers in Peru demonstrates the good results that come from continuing to share the Bible’s message to people of all sorts.
About 3,000 of our brothers and sisters are participating in a special public witnessing initiative in connection with the Pan American Games and Parapan American Games in Lima, Peru.
The games, which started on July 26, 2019, and conclude on September 1, will include more than 8,500 athletes and draw an estimated 250,000 tourists.
The publishers have set up 100 preaching stations in 53 different locations in order to accommodate the many visitors.
Literature is available in Aymara, English, French, Portuguese, Quechua (Ayacucho), and Spanish.
The public witnessing carts also feature videos in Peruvian Sign Language for deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors.
Brother Kemps Moran Hurtado, who is helping to coordinate the campaign, stated: “This initiative will allow us to reach a large concentration of people from different backgrounds and cultures, since the events draw an international audience.
Our public witnessing is a valuable aspect of our Bible education work—it offers a unique visible presence of Jehovah’s Witnesses to the public.”
We are excited to hear about this increased preaching activity.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to bless the work of our brothers and sisters in Peru as they continue to preach wherever people can be found.
On Wednesday, September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria, the fifth strongest hurricane ever to hit the United States, caused massive devastation in Puerto Rico.
As a result, the entire island is currently without power, and the government has issued a 6:00 p.m. curfew.
No injuries or fatalities have been reported among the brothers.
Relief efforts are underway.
The brothers will use an undamaged Kingdom Hall as a shelter and distribution center.
The Bethel facility in San Juan sustained minor damage.

As of September 25, 2017, information from 15 of the 19 circuit overseers in Puerto Rico has been received and only one injury has been reported among our brothers as a result of Hurricane Maria.
We have yet to receive updates from the four circuit overseers on the west side of the island, since communication has not been possible.
Brothers from nearby circuits have been acquiring motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles in order to travel to the west side to assess the situation.
We continue to keep our dear brothers and sisters in our prayers.
Update: Sadly, it has been confirmed that one elderly sister died as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

Others have donated nearly 300 tons of food, water, and supplies to those in need.
Circuit overseers report that all congregations are reestablishing their spiritual routines.
Members of the United States Branch Committee are planning to visit the affected areas to provide comfort and support.
“Our hearts go out to all those suffering due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey, and we are thankful for all who volunteered to help in the wake of this disaster,” states David A. Semonian, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“We especially keep our brothers and sisters who are affected by this storm in our prayers.
We also urge them to keep trusting in Jehovah’s loving arm of support.”
During May 2019, news reports indicated that heavy rains and some 500 tornadoes battered the United States.

Local Experiences: Martin Gulley, external communications manager for Metrolink, commented:
“You can say you love someone. You can say you love something.
But until you put it into action, it’s not [love] necessarily.
You are showing love in action.
What you are doing is humbling yourself, and love humbles you, it doesn’t exalt you.
I am identified as a Metrolink employee by this badge. You are identified as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses by the love.”
Jerry Vallely, external communications manager for Bi-State Development (a transit agency focused on encouraging economic growth in the St. Louis region), adds:
“You are not just looking at tasks on a checklist. You are really thinking about the people at the end; whether it’s the friends that are coming in to town, whether it’s the city that you are working with, or whether it’s us here at Metrolink.
You are thinking about the entire experience for everyone that you are working with and doing what you can to make things nicer, to make things better.”

Two detention centers in Palm Beach County, Florida, broadcast the prerecorded Memorial talk for more than 1,100 inmates on the evening of April 7, even though none of Jehovah’s Witnesses could be present to conduct the observance.
One of the 12 brothers who participates in a weekly volunteer ministry at the prisons said: “We were so surprised by how everything fell into place.
It was clear that Jehovah wanted these men to hear the Memorial talk.” The brothers had been seeking permission from the prison chaplain to hold the Memorial observance at the two detention centers.
After restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak were imposed, those plans were shelved.
Before the brothers could provide an alternate plan, the chaplain surprised them by asking for a prerecorded version of the Memorial discourse.
He was already arranging to broadcast the talk in both facilities.
In addition to the video, the brothers planned to send the chaplain Memorial invitations to distribute or post.
Again to their surprise, the chaplain had already posted notices around the buildings advertising the Memorial talk.
On the evening of the Memorial, every inmate had access to the broadcast of the Scriptural talk.
After the Memorial, the chaplain contacted the brothers to request more Bibles for the inmates.
All of the Bibles left at the detention centers had been distributed.
However, the requests for Bibles exceeded the supply.
We rejoice that not even prison bars can prevent God’s Word from reaching people.

Joseph F. Rutherford, then serving as president of the Watch Tower Society, was present when construction began on the Kingdom Hall located at 1228 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Hawaii.
The year was 1935.
This little building would carry the distinction of being the first in the world to be named “Kingdom Hall.” It would also serve as an anchor for tremendous growth over the next eight decades.
Today, 85 years later, the Pensacola Street Kingdom Hall is used by four congregations that support meetings held in five languages, including Hawaii Pidgin.
* The Kingdom Hall shortly after it was built in 1935 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, our brothers invited the local community, government officials, and educators to an open house from February 11 to 15, 2020, after completely remodeling the historic building.
Visitors were escorted on a tour of the building, viewed historical displays, and listened to presentations by the brothers that highlighted the activities of Jehovah’s modern-day organization.
The event culminated on February 16, with a dedication talk by Brother David H. Splane, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
One sister who helped with preparations for the program said: “Even though the community open house wasn’t about preaching, we feel that a great witness was given to many who may otherwise have never learned about Jehovah’s Witnesses.” The event helped our brothers and sisters gain a deeper sense of their rich spiritual heritage in the Hawaiian Islands and to personally see the fulfillment of the words, “In the islands of the sea they will glorify the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
^ par. 2 During the current COVID-19 pandemic, all congregation meetings in the United States are temporarily being held via videoconference rather than in Kingdom Halls.
In recent months, multiple wildfires have blazed across the state of California, charring some 362 square kilometers (140 sq mi) and leaving a massive burn scar on the landscape.
The United States branch reports that more than 1,700 brothers and sisters had to evacuate due to the various fires.
No injuries or fatalities have been reported.
The Sandalwood Fire in Calimesa that started on October 10, 2019, destroyed the home of one of our brothers.
Also, some homes have sustained minor smoke damage.
Almost all who evacuated have been able to return home.
“We can’t overstate the importance of obeying direction in these cases,” stated one elder who lives in one of the affected areas.
“Our brothers quickly evacuated the danger zones, and this allowed firefighters to concentrate on fighting the blaze instead of searching for people.” Circuit overseers and local elders continue to coordinate relief supplies for evacuees.
The loving concern and hospitality demonstrated by publishers in the surrounding areas have been outstanding.
Regarding this outpouring of Christian love, one circuit overseer noted, “We had no problem finding housing for all those displaced.” We are grateful to Jehovah for those who “have become a source of great comfort” for our brothers and sisters affected by these wildfires.
On November 14, 2019, a student opened fire on fellow classmates at a high school in Santa Clarita, California.
The gunman killed two students and wounded three, before shooting himself.
Sadly, Dominic Blackwell, the son of one of our sisters, was one of the students killed.
He was 14 years old and regularly attended meetings with his mother, Sister Nancy Blackwell.
Dominic is survived by his parents and three younger siblings.
The elders are providing Scriptural comfort and support to the family and the local congregation.
We are deeply saddened to hear about this tragedy.
We long for the time when God will “wipe out every tear .

Local Experience: Steve Moore, the president and CEO of Visit Phoenix, which helps book conventions, hotels, and resorts in the Phoenix area, commented:
“[This convention] is the most professionally organized convention I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with in a very long career.
And on top of that, you promise to clean the stadium before you leave—no one else does that.”"
In January 2019, the museum exhibits at world headquarters were officially made available in American Sign Language (ASL).
Enrique Ford, who oversees the Museum Department, explains: “The translation and computer programming effort that went into making the museum content available to the ASL community was extraordinary!
Now deaf and hard-of-hearing brothers and sisters who visit our exhibits can have an immersive, engaging, and educational experience when they tour.” Ana Barrios, who is deaf and serves as a regular pioneer in New York, was among the first to tour the exhibits in ASL.
She commented: “Getting the device with ASL content was thrilling!
Although I had been to the museum before and was familiar with the layout, the information had not yet touched my heart because I didn’t fully understand the details from just reading the English captions.
After watching a few tracks in ASL, I started to get a sense of Jehovah’s name in a way that I never had before.
The exhibit highlighted aspects of Jehovah’s personality that stirred emotions in me to the point of tears!” The ASL project began in June 2017.
A total of 23 brothers and sisters, including 6 deaf and 6 hearing publishers who grew up with deaf parents, helped with the translation and production of the museum content into ASL.
The translation group filmed over 900 videos, about nine hours of content, to match the museum audio tracks.
Recording sessions for the ASL tour information were conducted in three studio locations: the ASL remote translation office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; the United States branch facilities in Wallkill, New York; and the world headquarters offices in Warwick, New York.
Before releasing the final version of the ASL museum content, deaf brothers and sisters of different ages and backgrounds tested and helped refine the translation and tour experience.
Some of the brothers and sisters who assisted with the production of the ASL content for the Warwick museum.
The Museum Department purchased touch-screen devices that can display the ASL tour content in a similar format to the standard audio tour devices used for the Warwick museum exhibitions.
The Museum Department also enabled the existing 14 touch screens in the exhibits to accommodate ASL videos.
Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, states: “The purpose of the Warwick museum is to encourage and build up the faith of all who visit world headquarters.
We’re excited to have the museum exhibit content available in 14 languages, including ASL for visiting deaf and hard-of-hearing brothers and sisters and non-Witnesses alike.” To date, over half a million visitors have toured Warwick.
The worldwide brotherhood is invited to come and see firsthand the museum exhibits and learn more about the rich spiritual heritage of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
All who do so will be encouraged to continue to “put their confidence in God.”—Psalm 78:7.
Opened since April 3, 2017, the self-guided tours at world headquarters in Warwick, New York, are comprised of three exhibits.
“The Bible and the Divine Name” highlights that both God’s Word and his name have been preserved throughout history.
(Isaiah 40:8) Over 100 rare Biblical scrolls, leaves, manuscripts, and books are showcased.
“A People for Jehovah’s Name” includes a visual history of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Artifacts and first-person accounts showing how Jehovah has progressively guided his people are featured.
“World Headquarters—Faith in Action” explains the work of the six committees of the Governing Body and how they organize the worldwide activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Courage to Stand Firm in a Time of Trial” is a special rotational exhibit.
It covers the time period of 1914 to 1919, and shows how the Bible Students faced tests of their faith, both individually and as an organization.
The interactive experience allows visitors to enjoy rare original photographs, documents, and graphics, as well as audio and video interviews.
It has been open since October 3, 2018.
The exhibit content will eventually be transported and put on display at other branches and a new special exhibition will be opened at Warwick.

On Saturday, July 13, 2019, a Category 1 hurricane made landfall in Louisiana before quickly downgrading to a tropical storm known as Barry.
This tropical storm caused wind damage, flooding, and widespread power outages across the states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
Although no publishers were injured or killed by this storm, 123 were displaced.
Additionally, the storm damaged 27 homes of our brothers and sisters, as well as 5 Kingdom Halls.
Circuit overseers and local elders are shepherding those affected by the storm.
Also, publishers in neighboring congregations are providing water, food, and shelter where needed.
Efforts to stabilize properties and perform repairs locally are already underway.
Our prayers and support will continue to be with our brothers and sisters in the southern United States as they cope with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Barry.
On May 31, 2019, a gunman opened fire on employees working in a municipal office building in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States.
Twelve people were killed and four were injured.
The United States branch reports that sadly, one of our sisters, LaQuita Brown, was among those killed in this attack.
Sister Brown was 39 years old and a regular pioneer in the Seaview French Congregation in Norfolk, Virginia.
She also served as a Local/Design Construction volunteer.
The local elders, along with the circuit overseer, are providing Scriptural encouragement and emotional support to Sister Brown’s friends and family.
We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of our sister.
We look forward to the time when tragedies like this will no longer occur and there will be an “abundance of peace” on the earth.
A series of more than 100 tornadoes tore through the southeastern United States from April 12 to April 13, 2020.
The National Weather Service reported that one tornado, which spanned some two miles in width, was one of the largest in recorded history.
The branch immediately contacted circuit overseers in the area to determine how our brothers were affected.
No brothers or sisters were killed by the severe weather. One sister suffered minor injuries when a tornado hit her home.
In total, 63 publishers were displaced, 12 homes were destroyed, and 58 homes sustained damage.
Additionally, five Kingdom Halls were lightly damaged and one Kingdom Hall sustained major damage from a falling tree.
Local elders and circuit overseers are continuing to evaluate the situation.
They are caring for the immediate practical and spiritual needs of our brothers and sisters, providing much-needed comfort to those who suffered loss.
Tropical Depression Florence has inundated large parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, and other states with floodwaters.
Initially a Category 4 hurricane, Florence has killed at least 32 people and displaced thousands.
The United States branch reports that no publishers have been killed or seriously injured by the storm, although over 4,000 Witnesses have been displaced.
Though conditions are improving, some areas are still not accessible due to high floodwaters.
Current assessments indicate that the storm damaged 351 homes of our brothers and sisters and 21 Kingdom Halls.
Food, water, clothing, shelter, and basic medical needs are being coordinated through a Disaster Relief Committee (DRC).
Relief efforts include the work of two tree removal crews who are assisting with the widespread damage.
With flooding now becoming the major concern, volunteers from local congregations and others invited from elsewhere are coming to assist and will be working under the direction of the DRC.
Local elders and circuit overseers are making shepherding visits on those affected.
We pray for our brothers and sisters who are dealing with difficult circumstances as a result of the recent storm and look forward to the time when we will “feel no dread.
Deadly tornadoes ripped through portions of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, on Sunday, March 3, 2019, resulting in 23 fatalities and dozens of injuries.
The United States branch reports that there were no deaths among our brothers.
However, one of our sisters was injured when a tornado completely destroyed her home in Fort Valley, Georgia.
She is getting the necessary medical attention at a nearby hospital.
Additionally, the branch reports that six of our brothers’ homes sustained damage and four others were totally destroyed.
Under the direction of circuit overseers in the area, publishers have supplied food, shelter, and clothing to the affected brothers, and local elders are providing spiritual comfort.
We pray that our brothers who have been impacted by this disaster are comforted by our yeartext for 2019, “Do not be anxious, for I am your God.
The ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela continues to affect our brothers and sisters.
Every week, the branch office in Venezuela receives reports of publishers who have been victims of crimes.
Also, numerous Kingdom Halls in the country have been burglarized.
Our brothers face hyperinflation as well as shortages of food, medicine, and other basic goods.
Since 2013, over 20,000 publishers have fled to other countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.
* Despite these difficult circumstances, the approximately 140,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses who remain in Venezuela are active in their spiritual activities.
The branch office in Venezuela continues to organize the ongoing relief work within the country.
There are now 60 relief committees, which have primarily been tasked with distributing food to the brothers and sisters.
To date, the Venezuela branch, with the assistance of the Brazil branch, has distributed hundreds of tons of donated food to over 64,000 publishers in 1,497 congregations.
The Venezuela branch also continues to help care for the spiritual needs of the brothers and sisters.
This summer, there were 122 “Be Courageous”! Regional Conventions held throughout the country, the last of which concluded on September 2, 2018.
The conventions provided a vital spiritual boost to the brothers and sisters, many of whom had to overcome severe economic challenges to attend.
Witnesses in Venezuela are actively comforting the many distressed people in the country with the Bible’s message.
Currently, publishers conduct close to 200,000 Bible studies each month.
There has also been an increase of newly interested ones attending congregation meetings, and 7,259 individuals were baptized.
These positive spiritual developments demonstrate that God’s spirit is fortifying our Venezuelan brothers and sisters.
We pray that they continue to trust in Jehovah until his Kingdom ends all present distresses.—Proverbs 3:5, 6.
For more information on the situation in Venezuela, watch the video Venezuela—Love and Faith During Difficult Times.
^ par. 2 In times of economic, social, or political crisis, each publisher must decide whether or not to flee their country of residence.
The organization does not promote or encourage one’s decision to either leave or remain.
The social and economic crisis in Venezuela continues.
Access to food, water, fuel, and medicine is severely limited because of shortages and high prices.
Frequent power outages have intensified the food shortages, as the lack of power interferes with refrigeration.
Crime is a constant concern.
Despite these difficult conditions, the over 136,500 publishers in Venezuela continue to share zealously in the ministry.
For example, in January 2019, although there were 7,000 fewer publishers in the country compared to the previous year, they dedicated 90,000 more hours in the field ministry.
In April 2019, more than 195,600 Bible studies were being conducted.
The number of regular pioneers rose to over 30,000.
In response to the special worldwide effort to invite others to the Memorial of Christ’s death, the number of auxiliary pioneers increased to 20,400.
These efforts no doubt contributed to almost 471,000 people attending the Memorial—more than triple the number of publishers.
Additionally, congregation meetings are well supported, in part, because our brothers continue to provide the Bible’s message to people searching for a trustworthy solution to their problems.
The Venezuela branch continues to coordinate relief efforts to help our brothers receive basic food items to supplement their diet.
Each month, with the assistance of neighboring branches and generous donations to the worldwide work, the Venezuela branch distributes hundreds of tons of donated food to 75,000 publishers in 1,595 congregations.
Our brothers in Venezuela face many difficulties, but we are encouraged that they continue ‘exulting in Jehovah and being joyful in the God of their salvation.
NEW YORK—International media outlets have been reporting on deteriorating conditions in Venezuela set off by economic troubles.
The Venezuela Branch Committee reports that our brothers and sisters have also been affected by this crisis.
The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses is deeply concerned by these reports.
Armed criminals have entered some Kingdom Halls during weekly meetings to steal electronic devices and other valuables.
Additionally, in some cases, meetings are held in private homes because violent conflicts block access to Kingdom Halls.
A number of our brothers and sisters are among those who have lost their jobs because their place of employment closed down.
Some who own businesses have been targeted by criminals and gangs and, as a result, have been forced to sell their business and flee the country for their safety.
Sadly, over the last few years, there have been at least 680 brothers and sisters kidnapped, over 13,146 have been victims of armed robbery, and 144 have even been victims of rape or attempted rape.
Tragically, reports as of August 10, 2017, indicate that 47 of our brothers and sisters have been murdered.
Some have also died because they could not obtain needed medical treatment.
The Governing Body continues to closely monitor the situation, utilizing donated funds allocated to assist brothers and sisters who are in need of basic relief supplies.
The Governing Body is also communicating with other branches around the world to ascertain the most appropriate means of providing support for our brothers and sisters in Venezuela, since individual efforts to provide direct assistance can be dangerous.
The Venezuela Branch Committee has set up an emergency relief committee at the branch office that oversees 24 subcommittees throughout the country to care for the needs of our brothers.
The over 149,000 publishers in Venezuela are not only enduring despite suffering severe trials during the “last days,” they are also increasing their efforts to share the Bible’s comforting message with their neighbors.
(2 Timothy 3:1-5; 2 Timothy 4:2) Luis R. Navas, a spokesman from the Venezuela branch office, explains: “Spiritually, we have never been so prosperous.
Our congregation meeting attendance has increased.
More publishers are regular pioneering while at the same time exercising greater caution in the ministry.
Since our neighbors know that we are strictly neutral and that we do not share in any of the criminal activity plaguing the country, they welcome the Bible-based message of hope and comfort we share.” Jehovah’s Witnesses in Venezuela will continue caring for one another and comforting their neighbors.
Around the world, their fellow brothers and sisters will continue to support them and pray in their behalf.
On Wednesday, August 23, Hato, a Category 10 typhoon, battered southern China, including the cities of Hong Kong and Macau.
No deaths were reported in Hong Kong, but 34 people were injured.
In Macau, at least 9 people died and 153 were injured.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Hong Kong, which also coordinates the Witnesses’ work in Macau, reported that no Witnesses were killed by the typhoon.
However, many are without power and potable water in Macau.
The branch office is coordinating with local Witnesses to provide their fellow believers in need with drinking water and other supplies.
Over 5,500 Jehovah’s Witnesses live in Hong Kong, and another 320 live in Macau.
Heavy monsoon rains in Kerala, India, triggered some 25 landslides, killing at least 75 people.
According to the India Meteorological Department, the current southwest monsoon has produced some of the heaviest rains in the area’s history.
We are saddened to hear from our India branch office that, due to landslides, a Witness couple in their 60s and a Bible student lost their lives and two Bible students suffered serious injuries and are recuperating in the hospital.
Additionally, a 17-year-old brother drowned while trying to save his neighbor.
A local Disaster Relief Committee (DRC) was formed to assess the damage and organize the relief effort.
Some Kingdom Halls have been designated to serve as relief centers.
Preliminary reports regarding our brothers’ homes indicate that at least 46 have been damaged or destroyed.
Some 85 families (475 publishers) have been temporarily relocated to the homes of brothers or relatives.
It is reported that some Kingdom Halls have been partially submerged in the flood waters.
The DRC remains on alert as heavy rains have been forecast for the coming days.
Representatives from the branch office, along with a local circuit overseer and congregation elders, visited our brothers and sisters to provide comfort and Scriptural encouragement.
Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this devastating monsoon.
We look forward to the time when all such natural disasters and the resulting pain, will be no more.
On October 25, 2019, Brother Ashok Patel, a member of the India Branch Committee, released the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Telugu at a regional convention held in the Hyderabad International Convention Centre in Hyderabad, India.
An estimated 91.9 million people speak Telugu, making it the third most spoken language in India after Hindi and Bengali.
Currently, there are about 6,000 publishers who serve in the Telugu-language field, but the total attendance for the convention was 8,868.
These facts underscore the potential growth in this field, which has already seen the formation of two new circuits this year.
One translator, who assisted with the five-year Telugu Bible project, observed that younger people in particular struggle with the archaic language used in other Telugu Bible translations.
“With this new translation, it can be said that Jehovah will now speak to the young ones using a straightforward and contemporary vocabulary that can be easily understood.”
Another translator added, “In the ministry, people will easily understand the scripture as soon as we read it to them at the door.”
Additionally, since most Bibles in Telugu have omitted the Divine name, Jehovah, throughout the text, the New World Translation will help Telugu readers to know the name of the Almighty God.
It will also help readers to understand the original meaning of terms, such as soul and spirit, that other Telugu Bibles render in accordance with local Hindu beliefs.
One publisher expressed, “I feel that the Telugu Bible will help readers to feel Jehovah’s love like never before!” Clearly, this new translation in the Telugu language will help readers to “taste and see that Jehovah is good.
According to a media outlet, floods in India have killed at least 169 people in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala.
The India branch office reports that none of our brothers and sisters were killed or injured by the flooding.
The branch has provided the following details.
Gujarat: In the city of Vadodara, a total of 145 publishers were affected by the floodwaters.
The Gujarati remote translation office, which is located in Vadodara, was not damaged.
Maharashtra: In Mumbai, the homes of six families were affected.
In the city of Sangli, located some 378 kilometers (235 mi) southeast of Mumbai, 25 publishers were displaced.
Brothers in a nearby city provided temporary accommodations.
Karnataka: Six families were displaced by the floods.
The branch office is located in this state, but it was not affected by the heavy rains or flooding.
Kerala: Some 100 families have moved to higher ground and are temporarily staying with other Witnesses.
A Disaster Relief Committee is assessing the situation.
The branch office is coordinating the relief efforts in the affected areas.
Circuit overseers and Local Design/Construction field personnel have been working hard to evaluate and help our affected brothers and sisters.
This includes providing material support, such as the distribution of basic supplies like potable water, and spiritual encouragement.
We pray that Jehovah will continue to be with our brothers affected by the flooding.
We look forward to the time when natural disasters will be replaced by an “abundance of peace.
An especially severe monsoon season has resulted in deadly lightning storms and what experts consider the heaviest rainfall in some parts of India in over a century.
Several states have sustained damage from flooding and landslides; as many as 700 people have died and millions have been displaced.
As of July 31, 2017, there have been no casualties or serious injuries reported among Jehovah’s Witnesses.
However, the homes of at least three Witness families were flooded but did not sustain serious damage.
Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses within India are providing necessary relief aid to their fellow worshippers.
On November 16, 2018, Cyclone Gaja devastated the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
At least 46 individuals were killed, an estimated 250,000 were displaced, and over 85,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.
The home of one of our brothers in Mannargudi, Tamil Nadu, that was damaged by a fallen tree.
The India branch office reports that none of our brothers and sisters were injured or killed by the storm.
However, 38 homes of our brothers and 2 Kingdom Halls were damaged.
The branch established a Disaster Relief Committee to organize the relief work, including the distribution of food and water to affected publishers.
We pray that our brothers and sisters in India affected by Cyclone Gaja will be comforted by Jehovah through the loving oversight of the elders.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for the 11 remote translation offices (RTOs) in India, which translate our publications into 36 languages.
With Jehovah’s help, the translation teams are surmounting these obstacles and continuing their work.
Translation work depends heavily on collaboration.
But as COVID-19 spread, India went into strict lockdown, making it impossible for translators to meet in person.
Also, those responsible for audio and video recording could not hold recording sessions within the RTOs.
In the RTOs, in-person collaboration was replaced with videoconferencing and remote recording sessions.
These methods have expanded the resources available to the translators as they can now be assisted by brothers and sisters from other countries, such as Bangladesh and the United States.
The brothers have also found creative ways to produce sign-language videos while maintaining physical distancing.
Some translators have turned their bedrooms into studios and have created makeshift equipment, using cardboard boxes as camera tripods and cell phones in place of sophisticated cameras.
Along with these practical innovations, translators in the RTOs are depending on Jehovah to help them stay positive and productive during this time.
Here are some of their expressions: Brother Jose Francis from Kolkata stated, “When under difficult situations, humans may see a wall, but Jehovah can see a way around it.” Sister Bindu Rani Chandan from Bangalore said, “Knowing that Jehovah is using me in these perilous times gives me immense joy despite challenges.” Sister Rubina Patel from Vadodara expressed her feelings this way, “Nothing can stop Jehovah and his organization—not even the coronavirus.” We are proud of our brothers and sisters who are working diligently in the translation work.
We are certain that Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit is behind their success and that his spirit will also ensure the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy: “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.
At the end of July and the beginning of August, a series of earthquakes and aftershocks struck the island of Lombok, Indonesia, claiming the lives of at least 436 people and displacing about 350,000.
One of the earthquakes, a magnitude 7.0, flattened buildings and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
Reports from our branch office in Jakarta indicate that there have been no injuries or deaths among our brothers, although some publishers’ homes were damaged.
Additionally, the facility used for meetings by the 40 publishers who make up the only congregation on the island was damaged.
Two representatives from the branch office traveled to the affected area to evaluate any existing need for relief aid and to provide comfort.
Our prayers continue to be with our brothers during this difficult time, knowing that Jehovah is able to ‘comfort them in all their trials.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, September 28.
The earthquake, and a tsunami that followed, has killed over 1,300 people, the majority of whom were in the city of Palu in Central Sulawesi.
The Indonesia branch office, located in Jakarta, reports that all 80 publishers living in the affected area have been accounted for.
A few publishers sustained injuries and needed to be treated at a hospital.
One brother’s home was destroyed by the disaster and several other homes of Witnesses were severely damaged.
The building that the Palu Congregation uses to hold their meetings was also damaged.
The Disaster Relief Desk at the branch office is working with the circuit overseer and nearby congregations to coordinate the relief efforts.
Since the publishers in the affected area have limited food, water, and other necessities, the branch has arranged for three congregations to supply these items to their brothers in Palu.
Local elders are caring for the publishers’ spiritual, emotional, and physical needs.
A member of the Branch Committee, the overseer of the Local Design/Construction Department, and the circuit overseer for the area will also be visiting the affected publishers to provide comfort and support.
We pray for our brothers and sisters in Indonesia, knowing that Jehovah will continue to be their “refuge and strength” during this time of distress.
Torrential rains pounded the eastern province of Papua, Indonesia, on March 16, 2019.
The rains triggered a flash flood that killed more than 100 people and washed away several homes.
The Indonesia branch reports that many of our brothers living in the town of Sentani, located in the province of Papua, have been impacted by this disaster.
Sadly, one of our brothers died when his home was swept away in the flood.
Three other homes of Witness families were severely damaged.
More than 40 publishers have been evacuated, and most are now staying with local Witnesses.
A Disaster Relief Committee has been formed to organize the relief work.
Branch representatives, along with the circuit overseer in the area, have visited the affected regions to provide spiritual comfort.
They are also evaluating the extent of relief aid needed.
Our prayers are with all the brothers who have been affected by this disaster.
We long for the day in the near future when Jehovah will “swallow up death forever” and “wipe away the tears from all faces.
Typhoon Trami, a Category 1 storm, struck southern Japan on Sunday evening, September 30, 2018, bringing high winds and heavy rainfall.
The storm reduced intensity as it continued north over the weekend, eventually reaching Tokyo by Monday, October 1.
Three people were killed, some 200 were injured, and over 1.3 million homes were left without power.
According to reports from circuit overseers, the island of Okinawa, in southern Japan, was the most affected.
The initial investigation from the three circuits in Okinawa and surrounding areas revealed that none of our brothers were killed but nine suffered injuries.
The typhoon also damaged some 120 homes of our brothers and 5 Kingdom Halls on the island of Okinawa.
An additional 41 Kingdom Halls sustained damage as the storm passed through other regions of Japan.
Local circuit overseers and members of the Local Design/Construction Department are continuing their investigation to determine the extent of the damage and organize the spiritual and material relief needed.
Our prayers continue to be with our fellow worshippers affected by this storm and other natural disasters that have recently struck Japan.
We trust that our heavenly Father will continue to comfort the hearts of our brothers and make them firm.
Over 47,000 of our brothers and sisters live in the regions of western Japan that were devastated by floods in July 2018.
Soon after the disaster, some 4,900 volunteer relief workers swung into action to clean and repair damaged homes of Witnesses and Kingdom Halls.
Volunteers remove debris from the Kingdom Hall pictured in the lead image.
Under the direction of three Disaster Relief Committees, our brothers and sisters have cleaned and repaired nine Kingdom Halls that were damaged by floodwaters.
An additional Kingdom Hall is in the process of being repaired.
Also, 184 homes of Witnesses have been repaired or stabilized, and another 11 homes are scheduled to be repaired this year.

The Abe family from Ehime pictured after the brothers completed repairs on their flood-damaged home.
Taro and Keiko Abe, who have three children, were one of the families in Ehime who received assistance.
Just three days after the family’s house was flooded, brothers from the local circuit arrived and started to repair their home, which included replacing the damaged flooring.
Additionally, local Witnesses donated new beds and desks for the children.
On September 20, 2018, Governing Body member Geoffrey Jackson, who was in Japan for an assignment, took the opportunity to deliver an encouraging talk at a special meeting originating in a Kingdom Hall in Okayama.
The combined total of 36,691 brothers and sisters, which included some who were affected by typhoons and earthquakes that occurred during the same period in Japan, listened as Brother Jackson explained how Jehovah always cares for and comforts His people in all their trials.
Brother Jackson also took time to speak consolingly to individual victims of the disaster.
Along with our brothers and sisters in Japan, we are grateful to be a part of Jehovah’s organization, which demonstrates love in action and reflects the care of our heavenly Father.—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.
Brother Geoffrey Jackson, a member of the Governing Body, meets with a sister in Okayama who was affected by the flooding that devastated western Japan in July 2018.
At least 169 people have been killed in western Japan, and more than 255,000 households are still without water after torrential rains caused destructive flooding and landslides.
Although none of Jehovah’s Witnesses were killed in this disaster, 200 were evacuated and one sister was injured.
The injured sister was treated at a hospital and is now recovering.
At least 103 homes of our brothers were damaged, and one was completely destroyed.
Also, 11 Kingdom Halls and an Assembly Hall were damaged by the floodwaters.
Four Disaster Relief Committees (DRCs) have been formed to provide comfort and Scriptural encouragement to the affected brothers and sisters, as well as immediate practical help, which includes supplying food, clothing, and clean water.
The DRCs will also organize long-term relief efforts, which will involve cleaning, disinfecting, and repairing the damaged homes of our brothers.
We pray for our brothers and sisters affected by this disaster in Japan as we look forward to the time when Jesus will use his power to rid the earth of all disasters permanently.
"A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, on September 6, 2018.
The earthquake killed 41 people and caused massive power outages, limiting public transportation and communications on the island.
The branch office in Japan reports that although none of our brothers or sisters were killed, seven were injured in the earthquake.
A total of 100 homes of Witnesses and 4 Kingdom Halls were damaged.
Soon after the earthquake, under the direction of the branch office, publishers supplied our brothers in the affected areas with food, water, and other necessities.
A Disaster Relief Committee was formed to organize the long-term relief efforts.
We pray that Jehovah will continue to give our brothers and sisters affected by this earthquake peace of mind and heart.—Philippians 4:6, 7."
"On August 28, 2019, heavy rainfall in the Kyushu region of Japan caused widespread flooding.
Overflowing rivers and the potential for landslides led to evacuation orders for over 800,000 people.
The Japan branch reports that 82 publishers were displaced.
According to the latest report, a total of 40 homes of our brothers were damaged and one Kingdom Hall sustained minor damage.
The branch has established a Disaster Relief Committee to care for the affected publishers.
Circuit overseers, along with local elders and publishers, are caring for the immediate spiritual and physical needs of our brothers.
We are grateful that love is moving so many to respond to the needs of our fellow believers.—2 Corinthians 8:4."
"From September 21 to 23, 2019, Typhoon Tapah struck southern Japan with powerful winds and rain.
The storm caused flight cancellations, railway suspensions, and left over 30,000 homes without electricity.
In Okinawa and Kyushu, more than 50 people were injured.
The Japan branch office reports that five publishers were injured, including one sister who was hospitalized.
Over 50 homes of our brothers sustained damage.
A Disaster Relief Committee and responsible brothers are responding to the immediate physical and spiritual needs of the affected publishers.
The Japan branch will continue to monitor the effects of this typhoon and provide needed support.
We pray that our brothers in Japan continue to rely on Jehovah for comfort during this trial.—Psalm 94:19."
"On Tuesday, September 4, 2018, western Japan suffered the effects of what is being reported as the most powerful typhoon to hit the country in over two decades.
Authorities ordered a massive evacuation, and as anticipated, the deadly typhoon caused widespread damage.
The Japan branch has confirmed that no Jehovah’s Witnesses died.
However, at least 15 brothers and sisters were injured, and at least 538 homes were damaged.
Initial assessments also indicate that 44 Kingdom Halls have been damaged.
The Osaka and Sakai Disaster Relief Committees are collaborating to care for the relief work, which will include repairing the damaged homes as well as the important work of shepherding.
We are thankful that Jehovah is aware of the difficulties our fellow worshippers are facing and is giving them support by means of the brotherhood.—Psalm 34:19."
"On Saturday, April 13, 2019, Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body released the revised Japanese-language edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
The revision was released during a special meeting held at the Noevir Stadium Kobe in Kobe, Japan, with 20,868 in attendance.
The program was livestreamed to eight Assembly Halls and many Kingdom Halls in the branch territory.
Later that day and the next day, a video recording of the meeting was shown at Kingdom Halls for those who were not tied in to the original program.
A grand total of 220,491 were able to enjoy the special meeting over the weekend.
The Noevir Stadium Kobe
We rejoice with the over 2,950 Japanese-language congregations, groups, and pregroups worldwide that now have the revised New World Translation, a powerful gift from Jehovah for personal study and for use in the ministry.—Hebrews 4:12.
Brothers and sisters happy to receive their personal copy of the revised New World Translation
The New World Translation has a history in Japan that goes back 45 years. In 1973, Brother Lyman Swingle, who served on the Governing Body, released the Japanese-language New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures at the “Divine Victory” International Assembly in Osaka, Japan.
During the nine years following its release, 1,140,000 copies were distributed, approximately 75 times more than the number of publishers in Japan at the time.
In 1982, the complete New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was released, with printing and binding done in Japan.
Now, with the release of the revised Japanese-language edition, the year 2019 marks another milestone for Bible translation by Jehovah’s people in Japan.
The New World Translation has been translated in whole or in part into 179 languages, including 22 complete revisions based on the 2013 revised English edition."
"On October 25 and 26, 2019, Typhoon Bualoi battered the eastern coast of Japan. Notably, Bualoi is the third in a series of typhoons that have struck eastern Japan since September, following typhoons Faxai and Hagibis.
This latest typhoon caused rivers to overflow their banks, resulting in heavy regional flooding.
At least 81 homes of our brothers sustained damage.
There are no reports of fatalities among our brothers; however, one sister was injured.
The brothers and sisters in Chiba Prefecture have suffered as a result of all three typhoons.
Three Disaster Relief Committees (DRCs) in the affected area were already spearheading the relief efforts in connection with typhoons Faxai and Hagibis.
These DRCs are now also caring for those affected by Bualoi.
The Japan branch is assisting the DRCs to care for the immediate needs of our brothers, such as providing assistance for cleaning, disinfecting, and repairing homes.
Circuit overseers are coordinating efforts to encourage the brothers and sisters.
During this difficult time, we pray for our brothers in Japan, confident that Jehovah cares for his worshippers who are “crushed in spirit” by this series of natural disasters.—Psalm 34:18."
"On September 9, 2019, powerful Typhoon Faxai made landfall near Tokyo, Japan.
The typhoon packed winds of up to 180 kilometers per hour (approx. 112 mph) and left 580,000 homes without electricity.
At least three people were killed.
The Japan branch office reports that no publishers were killed but seven of our brothers and sisters suffered injuries.
Initial assessments indicate that the storm damaged 895 homes of our brothers, 28 Kingdom Halls, and one Assembly Hall located in Chiba.
The branch continues to assess Typhoon Faxai’s impact on our brothers.
We pray that Jehovah, “the God who supplies endurance and comfort,” will continue to support our brothers and sisters affected by this disaster.—Romans 15:5."
"The president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, pardoned Teymur Akhmedov, and he was released from custody on April 4, 2018.
Earlier, on March 27, 2018, authorities permitted Brother Akhmedov to receive urgent surgical care in a hospital in Almaty, where he is currently recuperating.
Brother Akhmedov, 61, has been in prison since January 18, 2017, for merely practicing his faith.
He is glad to finally be reunited with his family.
We all rejoice that Jehovah rescued his loyal servant.—2 Samuel 22:2."
"From May 11 to November 10, 2018, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kazakhstan invited their neighbors to seven open houses, which they held in select cities throughout the country.
These events provided an opportunity for government officials, journalists, and academics, along with the public, to learn about Jehovah’s Witnesses. In total, over 1,500 people attended.
Locations of open houses: (1) Öskemen, (2) Qaraghandy, (3) Qostanay, (4) Semey, (5) Shymkent, (6) Taldyqorghan, and (7) Taraz.
The open houses were hosted at Kingdom Halls in the cities of Öskemen, Qaraghandy, Qostanay, Semey, Shymkent, Taldyqorghan, and Taraz.
Attendees enjoyed displays detailing the history of our activities in Kazakhstan, which began as far back as 1892.
Displays also highlighted more modern achievements, such as the release of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Kazakh in 2014.
Brother Bekzat Smagulov, who works with the Legal Department and Public Information Desk at the Kazakhstan branch, comments on the benefits: “These open-house events were well-received by our neighbors and helped them gain an accurate picture of who we are.
Among the notable visitors were officials from the Department of Religious Affairs and journalists from the Kazakhstan-Öskemen news outlet, the Rudnyi Altai newspaper, and the Semei Vesti newspaper.”
At the open house in Taldyqorghan, the administrative center of the Almaty region, the brothers welcomed the head of the Regional Department of Religious Affairs and two other officials from the department.
Also in attendance was the editor-in-chief of the Zhetysu Dialog newspaper, who later published an article based on interviews with some of the volunteers at the event.
Additionally, our brothers and sisters distributed over 560 copies of the New World Translation in both Kazakh and Russian, the principal languages of Kazakhstan.
We appreciate the positive results of these arrangements, which bring praise to Jehovah and allow our neighbors to see our “fine works.”—Matthew 5:16."
"Following an official pardon from the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Brother Teymur Akhmedov was released from custody on April 4, 2018. He had been imprisoned for a total of 441 days.
Authorities had arrested him merely for sharing his religious beliefs with others.
Shortly after Teymur was released from prison, the Office of Public Information (OPI) at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Warwick, New York, spoke with him and his wife, Mafiza, who have now returned to their home in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
This is a condensed transcript of the conversation that has been edited for clarity.
OPI: To begin with, we would like to learn more about you, Brother Akhmedov.
When did you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
Teymur Akhmedov: I was baptized on October 9, 2005.
Before I learned the truth, I was an atheist.
For many years, I didn’t believe in anyone or anything.
Later, when my wife started to study, I was curious about the discussions she was having with the Witnesses.
I used to stand behind the door and eavesdrop on their conversations.
When I learned about what they were studying, I was intrigued because they talked only about kind and good things.
Eventually, the Witnesses introduced me to Brother Veslav, who was originally from Poland but was serving in Kazakhstan.
During our first discussion, I told him: ‘I am going to ask you only one question.
If I’m satisfied with your answer, we’ll be friends and continue our discussions.
If, on the other hand, I don’t like your answer, no hard feelings but I will not continue our discussions.’
I then asked Brother Veslav what happens to the dead.
He opened the Bible to Ecclesiastes 9:5 and said, ‘Read this verse and you’ll know what happens.’
When I read the verse, I realized that this was the truth.
I agreed to meet him again and study the Bible.
So, you studied the Bible and were eventually baptized in 2005.
Now let’s fast forward to the events that preceded your arrest.
In May 2016, you met a group of men who claimed to be interested in the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Over the course of a few months, you met with them several times to discuss the Bible.
Looking back on those conversations, was there anything they said or did that appeared suspicious?
TA: Yes, I mentioned that Bible studies like this are typically conducted with individuals rather than a group.
I recommended that they each study separately, but every time I suggested it, they refused and said that they liked the group discussions.
Also, on a number of occasions, they would invite others to join the study and ask me to repeat what we had already discussed on the previous visit.
Mafiza Akhmedov: Once, I also sat in on their Bible study.
I noticed that they were discussing different religions, although they had been studying for quite some time.
I also noticed that the apartment they lived in was more expensive than most students could afford.
I commented that they lived a rather opulent life for students.
My comments clearly made them uncomfortable.
When we were leaving, they pulled Teymur aside and, while I was waiting outside, told him not to bring me to the study anymore.
When did you find out that the men you were studying with weren’t interested in Jehovah’s Witnesses but were actually working with Kazakhstan’s secret police, the National Security Committee (KNB)?
TA: I only learned that they were cooperating with the KNB during the court hearing.
What was your reaction when you were arrested and then later charged with “inciting religious discord” and advocating “[religious] superiority”?
TA: Honestly, when I was arrested, I thought that they would escort me, as they said, to the police station in order to clarify the matter and then I would be released.
I was ready to defend myself and explain what I discussed with them.
I was quite surprised by the turn of events, but I was not afraid.
The accusations of inciting religious hatred and extremism were a big surprise to me.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are people who share their knowledge of Jehovah and have never been associated with hatred or discord.
I was firmly convinced that I was innocent and that Jehovah would support me.
It’s true that I was worried, but I remembered the advice from the Bible, “throw all your anxiety on him [Jehovah], because he cares for you.”—1 Peter 5:7.
As things developed, on May 2, 2017, after being in pretrial detention for over three months, a district court in Astana sentenced you to a five-year prison term and added a three-year ban on your participation in Bible education activities.
How did that verdict affect you?
TA: When the court announced its decision, I resigned myself to accept the fact that I will have to serve the full term if necessary.
My attitude was: ‘If this is a test, then Jehovah is in control of the timetable and he knows when it will end.’
I was determined to wait as long as it took.
The correctional facility in the city of Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, where Brother Akhmedov was imprisoned.
We understand, though, that at the time you were imprisoned, you were battling a serious health condition. Is that correct?
TA: Yes, I was sick and undergoing treatments before being imprisoned.
When I was arrested, my treatments were terminated and my disease started to progress.
Mafiza, how did you feel during this time?
MA: I was terrified and deeply depressed.
It was even difficult for me to make decisions after Teymur was imprisoned because for the 38 years that we had been married, we’d never been separated from each other.
But Teymur comforted me, saying: ‘Don’t worry! Jehovah will replace these 5 years of separation with 25 more years – even in this system of things!’
What else helped you during the time your husband was imprisoned?
MA: The brothers and sisters really helped me.
When Teymur was put into prison, I honestly thought that everyone would be afraid to visit me because of the circumstances surrounding Teymur’s arrest.
The KNB were monitoring our house and activities.
Then one day, an elder and his wife came to visit, and it was a tremendous boost for me.
When I asked them, ‘Aren’t you afraid to come here?’
They responded, ‘Why would we be afraid?
Nowadays, the authorities can track us through our phones.
So if they want to, they can easily find us.’
On a shepherding visit, the elders encouraged me to avoid being overcome by the test and be spiritually strong.
Teymur, what helped you to endure this particular test and remain positive?
Brother Akhmedov chained to a hospital bed in Almaty shortly before his release.
Although he was initially denied medical care, authorities permitted him to have treatment when his health situation became urgent.
TA: Prayer to Jehovah! Every day I prayed for guidance, understanding, and strength so that I could remain joyful, loyal, and faithful during my difficulty.
His answers to my prayers were obvious.
He supported me, and I did not feel that I was alone in prison.
Bible reading also assisted me.
In one of the prisons, I had a Bible available to me at all times.
In another facility, a Bible was kept in the prison library, and I could go and read it once a week.
I also remembered the words of the brother who studied the Bible with me.
He used to say that we should not be afraid of the challenges we face. I remember asking him: ‘Why should I not be afraid?
What if the challenge is difficult and terrifying?’
He said that Jehovah will not allow us to be tested beyond what we can bear and he will give us the strength to overcome any trial. (1 Corinthians 10:13)
So while in prison, I never forgot that Scriptural thought.
How did it make you feel when you found out that the brotherhood was aware of your situation and that brothers and sisters around the world were praying for you?
TA: I definitely felt that it was Jehovah’s hand because the organization belongs to him.
This assured me that I wouldn’t be abandoned and one day Jehovah would rescue me.
Interestingly, prison was actually the thing that I feared the most.
I was terrified of prisons.
When I would read about our brothers in prisons, I used to pray, ‘Jehovah, please, anything but prison!’
But at the same time, I had a very strong desire to visit people in jail and talk to them about the truth.
When I asked about engaging in prison witnessing, the brothers explained that at this time, we do not have permission to visit prisons in Kazakhstan.
So when I faced my trial, I had mixed feelings, on the one hand, I was afraid, but at the same time, I felt like my dream of being able to preach to prisoners was going to come true.
So did you get a chance to witness to some while you were in prison?
TA: Yes. On one occasion, I was summoned by a law-enforcement officer who wanted to speak with me.
When I came into his office, he said, ‘I know that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, so don’t even think about preaching to me!’ To which I replied, ‘I have no such intention.’
Then he asked, ‘What is God’s name?’ I said, ‘God’s name is Jehovah.’
He continued, ‘Then, who is Jesus? Isn’t he God?’ I said, ‘No, he is God’s son.’
He then asked, ‘Why, then, do Orthodox Christians believe he is God?’ And I said, ‘You should ask them about that.’
On another occasion, I was able to speak to about 40 or more people at the same time.
A psychologist had come to the prison to visit the inmates.
We were discussing marriage when she asked what we thought about polygamy.
Everyone had an opportunity to share their opinion.
When it came time for me to speak, I said that I don’t have a personal opinion on this, but I really like the opinion of another person on this topic, which I would like to share.
Then I said: ‘That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.’ (Genesis 2:24)
The psychologist asked, ‘Whose opinion is that?’ To which I replied, ‘It is the opinion of Jehovah God, the one who created mankind.
It mentions only two people; no more.’
She then asked, ‘Do you have any other reasons why you think that a man should have only one wife?’
I quoted Matthew 7:12, where it is written: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.”
I said: ‘These are the words of Jesus.
Please ask these gentlemen who are sitting in the hall if they would like to share their wife with somebody else.
If men do not want their wives to have another husband, then certainly women do not want their husbands to have multiple wives.’
The psychologist said that out of all the responses she liked my answer the most.
How encouraging to know that despite your difficult circumstances, you found opportunities to preach to those around you!
After the courts rejected multiple appeals for your release, including an appeal to Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court, it appeared that from a legal standpoint, all options had been exhausted.
Yet, you did have an opportunity to be released if you signed a confession.
Would you tell us about that opportunity and why you refused to sign?
TA: Well, they actually offered the proposal a few times.
Although it appeared to be an act of kindness, it was actually a document that stated I was guilty of the charges brought against me and that I apologized for my actions.
Later, I was offered the option of writing my own confession and requesting a pardon.
The authorities instructed me to write that I made a mistake by speaking to others about my beliefs but that I was now sorry for my actions and was requesting to be released because of my health condition.
I refused all such confessions of guilt and told the authorities that I would rather sit in prison with a clear conscience than be released with a guilty one.
We certainly appreciate your example of faith and refusal to violate your conscience.
Eventually, though, there was an unexpected turn of events. Would you please tell us how you learned that you would be pardoned and released from prison?
TA: One day a guard came to my ward to inform me that I had a phone call.
I remember thinking, ‘Who would call me?’ When I picked up the phone, a woman introduced herself and said that she would be coming to the prison to release me.
I really didn’t know how to react to the phone call.
So after she hung up, I decided to tell my son about it, since I didn’t want to shock my wife with the news or give her a false hope.
After I hung up the phone, the guard asked me, ‘What did they tell you on the phone?’
I told him that someone must be playing a joke on me, since the woman on the phone just told me that she is coming to the prison to release me.
Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body, with Teymur and Mafiza Akhmedov shortly after Brother Akhmedov was released from custody.
The guard replied that she was not joking and that what she said was true.
Mafiza, how did you react to this exciting news?
MA: When my son relayed the news to me, I also thought it was a joke. We had been waiting for this news for so long!
We can only imagine how you both must have felt when you were reunited over a year after Teymur was arrested!
Now, looking back, what have you learned from this test of your faith?
MA: I remember how I used to cry about the situation of Brother Bahram [Hemdemov] and [Sister] Gulzira Hemdemov.
[Brother Hemdemov was arrested in March 2015 by authorities in Turkmenistan.
On May 19, 2015, he was sentenced to four years in prison on fabricated charges of “inciting religious hatred” and has yet to be released.]
Even before Teymur’s arrest, I thought about how difficult it must be for Gulzira.
Now, I would like to hug her and send her my warm love and support.
Having been through this challenge with Teymur, I would like to tell her that I sympathize with her pain.
I know that, like me, she depends on the support of Jehovah and the brothers.
I am very grateful to all of the brothers who supported us, the brothers in our congregation and in all the congregations around the world, the Governing Body, the lawyers, and our sons.
Brother Akhmedov holding his certificate of pardon after being released from custody.
TA: I can say only one thing, everyone has tests that they must face.
Of course, not everyone will have a test of imprisonment.
For some, the test may be persecution from an unbelieving family member.
For others, maybe it is dealing with a brother or sister in the congregation who is difficult to get along with.
Whatever our challenge or test, we each have a choice whether to stand by God’s principles or ignore them.
If we stand by the principles, then we can get through the test successfully.
The best thing to do is to accept our tests and remember that Jehovah will give us the strength to get through them.
I am very thankful to my family and my sons, who supported me.
They used every opportunity to visit me, and it helped me to remain strong.
Additionally, I want to thank our brotherhood for all that they did.
I appreciated their prayers, and their encouraging letters.
I did not feel abandoned for one minute.
What has happened to me has increased my love for the brotherhood and strengthened my relationship with Jehovah."
"On November 30, 2018, the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Justice registered an office for Jehovah’s Witnesses in the city of Osh, the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan.
While our brothers have enjoyed national registration in Kyrgyzstan since 1998, after a new law on religion came into force in 2008, local authorities have routinely denied our brothers registration in cities in the southern region of the country, where Osh is located.
As a result, city authorities have often viewed our brothers’ Christian meetings and public ministry as illegal.
On occasion, the police have raided private homes or rented facilities where our brothers were gathering for worship.
We rejoice that this positive development will help further establish the right for Witnesses in Kyrgyzstan to meet freely for worship and peacefully share the Bible’s message with others.—1 Timothy 2:1-4."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses in the capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, received a certificate from the City Council’s office on June 14, 2018, officially granting permission to renew their religious entity.
Renewal certificate allowing Jehovah’s Witnesses to legally operate in Ulaanbaatar.
Religious organizations in Mongolia are required to renew their registrations annually, and our brothers had successfully done this since first being registered in 1999.
However, in 2015, the City Council withheld the renewal of our legal entity in Ulaanbaatar.
Then, in January 2017, the City Council issued a ruling that officially annulled permission for the legal entity to carry out its religious activity.
Council representatives refused to disclose the evidence they used to support their decision.
The brothers decided to legally challenge the City Council’s decision.
During the Administrative Court proceedings, the attorney for the City Council attempted to introduce as evidence the decision made by the Russian Supreme Court to liquidate our legal entities within Russia.
Our attorneys argued that this ruling has been the subject of international criticism and has been challenged in international courts.
Additionally, the court was reminded that Russia’s ruling came after the City Council’s decisions and therefore could not be used as justification for its conclusions.
The Administrative Court reversed the City Council’s decision, concluding that the council had acted out of hearsay and failed to provide evidence of any harmful activity.
It also found that the City Council had violated the brothers’ fundamental rights, including the freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs.
Jason Wise, one of the Witnesses’ attorneys who argued the case, stated: “While fundamental rights and freedoms do not depend on State registration, it is often difficult to worship freely without registration.
Among other things, our legal entity facilitates importing Bibles and Bible literature, owning places of worship, and renting convention facilities.
We are pleased that the Administrative Court overturned the City Council’s decision in Ulaanbaatar and recognized that such rulings would negatively affect our freedom of religion and association in Mongolia.”"
"Heavy monsoon rains led to floods and landslides in Nepal, displacing thousands of people and killing more than 140.
The flooding damaged highways and power lines, hampering relief efforts.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Japan, which also coordinates the Witnesses’ activities in Nepal, reports that no Witnesses were injured or killed in the incident.
However, at least four Witness families were forced to evacuate from their homes, which were damaged by the floodwaters.
Local Witnesses have been caring for their fellow believers who were displaced.

"On August 28, 2019, heavy rains caused the Talomo River to overflow in Davao City.
According to government data, the subsequent flooding forced some 545 families to evacuate.
The Philippines branch office reports that 120 publishers from five congregations were impacted by this disaster.
Many of the publishers had to take refuge at the local Kingdom Hall.
Floodwaters destroyed three of our brothers’ homes and damaged four.
The branch established a Disaster Relief Committee (DRC) to care for the needs of the affected brothers and sisters.
The DRC has already coordinated the delivery of relief supplies and organized the cleaning of the flooded homes.
We pray that our brothers and sisters in Davao City will continue to be comforted by the brotherly love that abounds even during difficult times.—Romans 12:10."

"Typhoon Vongfong (locally known as Ambo) made landfall on the island of Samar on May 14, 2020.
The Category 3 typhoon, the first tropical storm of 2020 in the Western Pacific Ocean, battered Samar with winds of up to 185 kilometers per hour (115 mph).
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, a process that proved to be especially complicated because of government-mandated physical distancing.
While none of our brothers and sisters were injured, 59 of them had to evacuate their homes.
They were accommodated either in schools, which are being used as shelters, or in the homes of fellow Witnesses.
Additionally, 82 of our brothers’ homes were either destroyed or damaged.
Five Kingdom Halls were also damaged, and one was completely destroyed.
The Philippines Branch Committee has formed two Disaster Relief Committees to respond to the physical and spiritual needs of our affected brothers and sisters.
We will continue to pray for our brothers in the Philippines who are enduring the dual disasters of a typhoon and a pandemic.
We are fully confident that Jehovah, our “eternal Rock,” will continue to care for their needs.—Isaiah 26:4."
"In early August 2019, monsoon weather struck the Philippines with heavy rains and strong winds, causing flooding and landslides.
Sadly, one brother who was serving as a temporary special pioneer was killed by a landslide in Natonin, Mountain Province.
Another brother, who also serves as a temporary special pioneer, sustained minor injuries in the same landslide.
In a separate incident, a ten-year old boy was injured by debris but received appropriate medical care.
None of our brothers’ homes were seriously damaged.
However, one Kingdom Hall in Negros Occidental suffered minor damage from strong winds that caused a portion of the ceiling to fall.
The Philippines branch office and the local circuit overseer are providing spiritual and emotional support to the families of our affected brothers.
We are saddened to hear of this tragic loss and pray for those grieving the death of our brother.
We look forward to the day when painful events will not even “be called to mind.”—Isaiah 65:17."
"Typhoon Yutu, which previously had struck the Northern Mariana Islands as a super typhoon on October 24, made landfall on Luzon, the largest island of the Philippines, on Tuesday, October 30.
Heavy rainfall from the storm caused flooding and fatal landslides.
Thousands of people were evacuated, and 11 people were killed.
The Philippines branch reports that no brothers or sisters were killed or injured by the storm.
However, 73 homes of our brothers were damaged as well as 6 Kingdom Halls.
The Philippines branch is coordinating the relief work.
We continue to pray for our brothers and sisters in the Philippines, who have been affected by 18 typhoons this year.
Along with them, we trust in Jehovah, knowing that he will sustain us.—Psalm 55:22."
"In Davao City, Philippines, over 31,000 non-Witnesses linked in to one congregation’s Memorial commemoration.
In obedience to governmental restrictions, the congregation was not able to meet together, so they held their observance via videoconference.
The extraordinary turnout was the result of one young pioneer’s invitation.
Seventeen-year-old Daphane Jane is a regular pioneer in Davao City.
She has been battling the early onset of glaucoma for several years, which has degenerated her eyesight.
Daphane was determined to invite the doctor who has been treating her glaucoma to view the special talk and the Memorial via videoconference.
The doctor was impressed that Daphane could answer his questions using the Bible and direct him to articles from jw.org, so he accepted her invitation.
On Sunday, April 5, not only was the doctor tied in to the special talk but 12 of his colleagues were tied in as well.
Those colleagues, in turn, had invited yet more people.
As a result, 128 people linked in to the special talk.
After the program, one of the doctors admitted that he previously “hated Jehovah’s Witnesses” and opposed our ministry.
But having heard the special talk, he expressed: “I would like to apologize because I shouted at one of your sisters and humiliated her.
Thank you so much for the privilege of listening to your talk.
Please continue your preaching work.”
Daphane’s doctor decided to also watch the Memorial program and invite even more of his colleagues.
Since the congregation’s videoconferencing system could not handle the added number of people, the doctor even assisted in hosting the videoconference.
On the day of the Memorial, medical professionals, policemen, and high government officials were linked in to the meeting.
By the end of the Memorial, over 31,000 had connected to the program either by video or audio.
One medical professional thanked Daphane and the brothers for the invitation and said: “We had no idea that Jehovah’s Witnesses preach online.
You are using technology in a very good way.”
Another stated: “Many of us, doctors and nurses, were able to join.
It’s been a long time since we have listened to a Bible talk, and this is the first time we had it through videoconference.
We were surprised that the Witnesses have this way of worship.
We hope that you continue these arrangements.
It is a very big help especially during these times when things are getting worse.”
For some, the special talk and Memorial were especially moving.
One viewer expressed: “It was my first time to cry while listening to a Bible-based talk.
I am very thankful to you, Daphane Jane, that you invited your doctor, and we too were included among those comforted.
Now, I believe that there is a God, and I thank you, because my point of view was changed.”
Having seen how Jehovah has helped her, Daphane Jane is determined to keep on preaching despite her physical limitations and the challenges of the pandemic.
Her experience reminds us that we should “not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.”—Galatians 6:9."
"At special events held during January 2019, Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body, released the Bible in Cebuano, Tagalog, and Waray-Waray.
The Cebuano edition was released at the Hoops Dome in Lapu-Lapu City on January 12.
The following day, the Waray-Waray edition was distributed at the Leyte Academic Center in Palo, Leyte.
On January 20, the Tagalog edition was released at the Metro Manila Assembly Hall in Quezon City.
A family enjoys their new copy of the revised New World Translation in Cebuano.
Hundreds of Kingdom Halls were tied in to these programs, and over 163,000 copies of the New World Translation were distributed.
Brother Dean Jacek, at the Philippines branch office, explains: “The Cebuano and Tagalog editions are revised versions of the New World Translation.
Each took over three years to develop.
The Waray-Waray language previously only had the Christian Greek Scriptures, so this is the first time readers can enjoy the complete New World Translation.
This project took over five years to complete.”
In the Philippines, over 60 percent of the population speaks Cebuano, Tagalog, or Waray-Waray.
That number includes nearly 160,000 of our brothers and sisters, as well as over 197,000 Bible students.
Additionally, there are tens of thousands of Filipinos who reside outside of the Philippines who will now be able to enjoy all the features of the New World Translation in these languages.
Sister Donica Jansuy, who attends a Tagalog congregation in the United States, said after downloading her new edition of the Bible: “The words in the revised Tagalog translation are so simple and clear, making it easier to grasp.
The use of simple words helps us to feel like Jehovah is talking to us on a more personal level, making it easier for the Bible’s message to touch our hearts.”
To date, Jehovah’s Witnesses have made the New World Translation available in whole or in part in 179 languages.
We thank Jehovah for making clear translations of his Word available for our brothers and sisters and to those with whom they share the Bible’s message.—Acts 13:48."
"On July 27, 2019, two earthquakes ravaged the small island of Itbayat in the Philippines, some 690 kilometers (430 mi) north of Manila.
The earthquakes registered at 5.4 and 6.4 in magnitude, killed 9 people, injured 64, and destroyed 266 homes.
Officials report that 2,968 people were affected by the earthquakes.
None of our brothers were killed in the earthquakes.
However, one sister suffered a minor injury.
Also, two homes of our brothers were heavily damaged.
The branch office set up a Disaster Relief Committee, and it is facilitating the purchase and distribution of basic supplies such as food and water.
Representatives from the branch office will be visiting the affected brothers and sisters to provide spiritual comfort and practical assistance.
We pray for our brothers and sisters affected by the recent earthquakes.
We know that Jehovah, “the God of all comfort,” will continue to care for our brothers’ needs.—2 Corinthians 1:3."
"In March 2019, a fire in the Philippines burned 128 homes in Calbayog City on Samar Island.
The previous month, fires broke out in Taguig City on the island of Luzon.
In total, seven homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses were destroyed by these fires.
Our displaced brothers and sisters are currently staying with other Witnesses whose homes were unaffected.
The branch office responded promptly by organizing efforts to supply food, water, and clothing.
The local elders shepherded the affected brothers and provided practical assistance.
Two Disaster Relief Committees, with the support of Local Design/Construction personnel, are preparing to rebuild the homes of our fellow worshippers.
We trust that Jehovah will continue to be a refuge for our brothers impacted by these fires.—Psalm 62:8."
"On January 12, 2020, the Taal volcano in Batangas, Philippines, spewed ash some fourteen kilometers (9 mi) into the sky, prompting warnings of a possible “hazardous explosive eruption.”
The authorities have ordered a total evacuation of tens of thousands of people living near the volcano, one of the most active in the country.
To date, over 500 brothers have been evacuated to safe locations that included Kingdom Halls and private homes of other Witnesses.
None of our brothers have been injured.
The Branch Committee has appointed a Disaster Relief Committee to address the immediate needs of the evacuees.
We pray that our brothers and sisters in the Philippines will continue to trust in Jehovah, “our refuge and strength.”—Psalm 46:1-3."
"Typhoon Kammuri, also known in the Philippines as Tisoy, made landfall on December 2, 2019, in the Bicol region of southern Luzon.
Although none of Jehovah’s Witnesses were killed or injured, 108 homes of Witness families sustained heavy damage and 478 were partially damaged.
Additionally, 15 Kingdom Halls were damaged.
Because of the widespread impact of the storm, the Philippines branch formed eight Disaster Relief Committees to provide spiritual and material help to the brothers.
We pray for our brothers in the Philippines, echoing the words of the psalmist: “May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress. . . . May he send you help from the holy place.”—Psalm 20:1, 2."
"A fire broke out on August 5, 2017, in the Agdao section of Davao City, located on the coast of Mindanao Island in the southern Philippines.
Although there were no casualties among Jehovah’s Witnesses, the homes where 13 families were living sustained major fire damage, affecting 29 individuals.
The victims displaced by the fire have been accommodated in the residences of fellow Witnesses.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Manila appointed a disaster relief committee to coordinate the distribution of relief supplies.
The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses facilitates disaster relief efforts from their world headquarters, using funds donated to the Witnesses’ global ministry work.

"On December 29, 2018, Tropical Depression Usman made landfall over Samar, the third largest island in the Philippines.
The storm brought torrential rain, causing landslides and flash flooding.
At least 25 people have been killed, and 42 were injured.
A total of 22,835 homes sustained damage.
The Philippines branch reports that no brothers or sisters were killed by the storm.
However, three homes of our brothers were destroyed, and four were partially damaged.
Additionally, one Kingdom Hall was damaged.
Under the direction of the branch, a Disaster Relief Committee provided relief supplies and temporary housing to the affected families.
We are confident that our brothers and sisters affected by this storm will continue to put their trust in Jehovah, knowing that he will make them firm and strong.—1 Peter 5:10."
"Tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes as two deadly tropical storms, Kai-tak (known locally as Urduja) and Tembin (known locally as Vinta), caused flooding and mudslides in the Philippines at the close of December.
The storms damaged two Kingdom Halls and six private homes owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses, and 281 families had to evacuate.
We are saddened to report that, in Lanao del Norte, one 24-year-old sister drowned in floodwaters.
Basic relief supplies have been provided by fellow Witnesses in the local area.
Representatives of the Philippines branch office are preparing to visit the affected area to assess further the needs of the brothers and to provide spiritual and emotional support.
Our hearts go out to all those who are affected and suffered loss.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to provide comfort and practical help through his spirit and organization as the recovery work moves forward.—Psalm 9:9; Isaiah 51:12.

"A series of powerful earthquakes have rocked the southern Philippines since October 16, 2019, killing 21 people, injuring over 400, and displacing more than 35,000.
At least three of these quakes registered above magnitude 6.0.
Aftershocks continue to occur in the area.
None of our brothers were killed, although one sister experienced a minor injury.
Four Kingdom Halls and 195 of our brothers’ homes were heavily damaged; 9 Kingdom Halls and 351 homes sustained partial damage.
Many of our brothers are living in tents because it is unsafe to be inside their homes.
The Philippines branch office has appointed two Disaster Relief Committees to coordinate the relief efforts.
Six branch representatives, including three Branch Committee members, have visited the affected area to provide spiritual encouragement.
We pray that Jehovah will continue to help our brothers affected by this earthquake.—Psalm 70:5."
"For the first time in South Korean history, government prosecutors requested an appeals court to issue not-guilty verdicts in the cases of five of our brothers who refused military service.
In turn, the court acquitted the brothers and closed their cases completely.
These rulings forcefully quash, or overturn, lower-court rulings that had charged our brothers with evading military service.
The not-guilty verdicts, announced on December 14, 2018, set a clear precedent to acquit over 900 brothers with similar cases pending in the Korean court system.
Brothers who are acquitted will await the implementation of an alternative service arrangement that can be undertaken instead of military duty.
The appeals court based its verdicts on two historic decisions by Korea’s Constitutional and Supreme Courts in 2018.
Those rulings terminated the 65-year policy that imposed a virtually automatic prison sentence on conscientious objectors, regardless of the sincerity of their religious stand.
The two high-court decisions, which recognize conscientious objection as a fundamental right based on freedom of conscience, earned praise from human rights organizations.
The National Human Rights Commission of Korea stated: “The Supreme Court full-bench decision brought an end to the painful history of criminally punishing conscientious objectors, which began in the 1950s, affecting almost 20,000 conscientious objectors . . .
We express our deepest respect for the sacrifices conscientious objectors and their families have had to endure.”
Now, conscientious objectors are asked to prove that their refusal to perform military service is based on “deep, firm and genuine” beliefs.
Judges have been instructed to look for evidence of the objector’s sincerity.
In the words of the Supreme Court, “All aspects of his life . . . should be influenced by the deeply held conviction.”
As they answer the judges’ probing questions, our brothers thus have a fine opportunity to testify about their personal decision to abstain from war and military service.—1 Peter 3:15.
For more than six decades, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Korea endured prison terms for their stand of conscience, furnishing powerful evidence that our peaceable position of Christian neutrality stems from a wholehearted desire to obey the second greatest commandment, to ‘love our neighbor as ourselves.’—Matthew 22:39."
"On Thursday, August 30, 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court held a full-bench public hearing on the cases of three Jehovah’s Witnesses who are conscientious objectors to military service.
Reflecting the intense public debate over Korea’s long history of imprisoning objectors, all 13 justices spent four hours questioning the Witnesses’ attorneys and others about the issue.
The justices discussed at length the landmark Constitutional Court ruling of June 28, 2018, which ordered the Korean legislature to implement alternative service for genuine conscientious objectors rather than imprisoning them as criminals.
The attorneys asked the Court to declare our three brothers not guilty, setting a strong precedent that will clarify how lower courts should decide on over 900 similar pending cases.
It is now up to the Supreme Court to decide when and how to rule in the three representative cases they considered during the hearing.
With full confidence, we along with more than 100 of our faithful brothers still in prison will continue to wait patiently for the God of our salvation.—Micah 7:7."
On February 28, 2019, the last one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in South Korea imprisoned for neutrality was released.
All the brothers who have been set free have expressed deep gratitude for their newfound freedom and the opportunity they had to prove their loyalty to Jehovah God.
A total of 65 brothers have been released since the historic Supreme Court decision on November 1, 2018, which declared that conscientious objection to military service is not a crime.
The ruling brought to an end the 65-year-old practice of imprisoning conscientious objectors.
The faith and integrity of our Korean brothers motivates us to ‘show all the more courage’ in our own loyal service to our King and his Kingdom.
(Philippians 1:14) We pray for our brothers who remain imprisoned in Eritrea, Russia, Singapore, and Turkmenistan.—Hebrews 10:34.
For some 65 years, young Christian men in South Korea have faced the certain prospect of imprisonment for their conscientious objection to military service.
On Thursday, June 28, 2018, a landmark ruling by the Constitutional Court changed that prospect by declaring Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Military Service Act unconstitutional because the government makes no provision for alternative service.
Journalists outside the Constitutional Court.
The case was closely followed by the international media.
The nine-judge panel, headed by Chief Justice Lee Jin-sung, announced the 6-3 decision, which moves the country more in line with international norms and recognizes freedoms of conscience, thought, and belief.
Representatives of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Korea inside the Constitutional Court moments before the Court’s decision.
South Korea has annually imprisoned more conscientious objectors than all other countries combined.
At one point, an average of 500 to 600 of our brothers went to prison every year.
Upon their release, all conscientious objectors carried with them a lifelong stigma due to their criminal record, which among other challenges limited their employment opportunities.
Starting in 2011, however, some brothers filed complaints with the Constitutional Court because the law provided no option other than imprisonment for their stand of conscience.
Likewise, since 2012, even some judges who were troubled by the practice of punishing sincere objectors decided to refer their cases to the Constitutional Court for review of the Military Service Act.
Hong Dae-il, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Korea, is interviewed outside the courtroom after the decision The role of the Constitutional Court is to determine if a law harmonizes with Korea’s Constitution or not.
After having twice ruled (in 2004 and 2011) to uphold the Military Service Act, the Constitutional Court has finally agreed that change is needed.
The Court ordered the government of South Korea to rewrite the law to include an alternative service option by the end of 2019.
Alternative types of service that they may implement could include hospital work and other non-military social services that contribute to the betterment of the community.
Putting the decision in perspective, Brother Hong Dae-il, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Korea, states: “The Constitutional Court, which is the ultimate stronghold for protecting human rights, has provided a foundation for resolving this issue.
Our brothers look forward to serving their community by means of alternative civilian service that does not conflict with their conscience and is in line with international standards.” Other important issues await settlement, including the status of the 192 Witness objectors currently imprisoned and some 900 criminal cases pending in various levels of the courts.
The historic decision of the Constitutional Court provides a firmer basis for the Supreme Court to rule favorably in cases of individual objectors.
A full bench ruling of the Supreme Court will influence how these individual criminal cases should be handled.
The Supreme Court is expected to hold a public hearing on August 30, 2018, and will issue a ruling some time thereafter.
It will be the first time in 14 years that the Supreme Court’s full bench will review the issue of conscientious objection.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly, Korea’s legislature, is already working on revisions to the Military Service Act.
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body states: “We keenly anticipate the Supreme Court’s upcoming hearing.
Our Korean brothers willingly sacrificed their freedom, knowing that ‘it is agreeable when someone endures hardship and suffers unjustly because of conscience toward God.’ (1 Peter 2:19) We rejoice with them that the injustice they endured has finally been recognized, along with their courageous stand of conscience.
On Thursday, November 1, 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court decided in a 9-4 decision that conscientious objection does not constitute a crime.
Religious conscience is now considered “justifiable grounds” for refraining from military enlistment.
This landmark decision by South Korea’s highest court lays the groundwork for issuing not guilty verdicts for the over 900 brothers with cases pending in all levels of Korea’s court system.
Earlier in the year, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that there must be a provision for conscientious objectors to have alternative service options by December 2019.
We rejoice and praise Jehovah for this historic decision
On April 4, 2019, a large forest fire broke out along the eastern coast of South Korea in the Gangwon Province.
The fire spread rapidly, prompting the government to declare a national emergency.
Before the blaze was brought under control, over 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) were scorched and two people lost their lives.
Branch reports indicate that there were no casualties among our brothers.
However, eight homes were damaged, affecting 27 of our brothers and sisters.
Under the direction of the branch, the Disaster Relief Committee and the circuit overseer in the region are working with the congregation elders to provide spiritual and practical support to those impacted by this disaster.
We are confident that Jehovah will be for our brothers a “refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress.”—Psalm 46:1.
On June 28, 2018, for the first time in South Korea’s history, the Constitutional Court declared a section of Korea’s Military Service Act (MSA) unconstitutional, as it does not provide alternative service for conscientious objectors.
The landmark ruling is the key to reversing a 65-year-old policy of imprisoning conscientious objectors under the MSA.
Since 1953, over 19,300 of our brothers have been sentenced to a combined total of more than 36,700 years in prison.
The Constitutional Court’s decision now opens the door for the Supreme Court of Korea to apply this ruling to specific cases involving conscientious objectors.
In addition, Korean lawmakers are now obligated to institute alternative service for conscientious objectors by December 31, 2019.
We all rejoice with our brothers in Korea that the foundation has been laid to end decades of injustice.—Proverbs 15:30.
The Korea branch reports that on November 30, 2018, 57 brothers were freed from prison and reunited with their families.
The worldwide brotherhood rejoices with this highly-anticipated development and praises Jehovah for granting his favor and blessing.—Numbers 6:24-26.
We pray for the eight brothers remaining in prison, who are expected to be released sometime after they have served 6 months of their 18-month sentences.
Recently released brothers reunite with their parents (left, right).

During the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, which were held from February 9-25, 2018, and March 9-18, 2018, brothers and sisters in Korea engaged in a special campaign to offer the many international visitors Bible-based publications free of charge.
Over 7,100 brothers and sisters from throughout the country participated in the campaign.
Many of them came from the cities of Busan, Gwangju, Incheon, Seoul, and Suwon; some even came from as far away as Jeju Island, a popular tourist destination located over 300 miles south of Pyeongchang.
Our brothers set up 152 public witnessing carts in 48 locations, including the Gangneung Olympic Park and the Pyeongchang Olympic Plaza.
They were also permitted to display some of their publications at the entrance to one of the Olympic Village religious centers.
Two carts near the north gate of Gangneung Olympic Park.
Additionally, authorities granted our brothers permission to place carts in the Gangneung Station Square, the final stop of the recently completed high-speed KTX Gyeonggang Line, which transports passengers from Incheon and Seoul to Pyeongchang.
On the opening day of the Olympic Games, over 28,000 people traveled through Gangneung Station.
In order to accommodate the estimated 80,000 foreign visitors, our brothers offered books, brochures, magazines, and tracts in as many as 20 languages including Chinese, English, Kazakh, Korean, and Russian.
Additionally, brothers and sisters fluent in Korean Sign Language used carts featuring sign-language videos to welcome the many deaf persons who came to the Paralympics.
Over 71,200 pieces of literature were distributed, including more than 22,000 Memorial invitations.
Worldwide, Jehovah’s Witnesses use over 300,000 carts to display their literature in over 35 countries.
In this way, they are able to preach to people wherever they may be found and fully accomplish their ministry.—2 Timothy 4:5.
Thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses from seven countries joined their brothers and sisters in Sri Lanka for a special convention, the first ever in Sri Lanka.
The “Be Courageous”! Special Convention was held in the capital city, Colombo, from July 6 to 8, 2018, at the Sugathadasa National Sports Complex. The peak attendance was 14,121.
Highlights included discourses presented by a member of the Governing Body, a record number baptized at one time, and outstanding hospitality shown by the local brothers and sisters to some 3,500 delegates.
Preparations began in September 2017 when congregations in Sri Lanka were informed that a special convention would be held the following year.
In addition to all the arrangements that were needed to host the event, the stadium was in need of significant repair and cleaning.
This effort included painting, removing garbage, fixing broken chairs, and repairing holes in the road.
Three weeks before the convention began, hundreds of Witnesses arrived to assist in the effort.
One security officer remarked that it would have taken the maintenance staff up to four years to accomplish what the brothers were able to do in such a short time.
The spiritual program was complemented by a variety of tours and activities highlighting the Sri Lankan culture.
An evening performance of traditional dancing and singing was a memorable aspect of the program, which also included a group of young Witnesses singing Kingdom songs.
Ashley Ferdinands, a representative at the branch office in Sri Lanka, said: “This special convention was a true gift to the brothers and sisters in our country and it was a privilege to host so many delegates.
We are very appreciative for the help of the many volunteers who made this convention a success.
Of course, we give all praise to our heavenly Father who is the source of all good gifts and presents.”—James 1:17.
On July 5, 2019, the revised edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Chinese was released at a regional convention in Taoyuan City, Taiwan.
Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the Governing Body, delivered the release talk at the National Taiwan Sport University Stadium.
A total of 12,610 people, including viewers tied in at four other conventions, attended this momentous occasion.
The Chinese New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures was first published in 1995 in two editions, one using the traditional script common in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the other using simplified script common in China, Malaysia, and Singapore.
The complete New World Translation in Chinese was released in 2001, again in two editions, one in traditional and the other in simplified.
A third edition, containing simplified Chinese characters along with Pinyin, text rendered in the Roman alphabet, was published in 2004.
The revised New World Translation was also released in three editions.
Traditional and simplified Chinese are available both in printed and digital format, while the edition including Pinyin is available on Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™.
Chinese Mandarin is the largest primary language in the world and has a total of over 1.1 billion speakers.
In addition to those who speak Mandarin, Chinese characters are read by millions who speak other dialects.
Our brothers and sisters working in this vast field can now use the revised New World Translation to help more people come to know Jehovah and gain accurate knowledge of his Word.—1 Timothy 2:4.
During the night of Tuesday, February 6, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck near the east coast of Taiwan.
Media reports indicate that at least 6 people have been confirmed dead and over 250 were injured.
An additional 76 people are still missing.
No publishers were killed or injured in the earthquake.
However, a building that houses both the Amis (an indigenous Taiwanese language) remote translation office and a Kingdom Hall located in Hualien, one of the worst-hit areas, was damaged.
Additionally, an apartment where some members of the translation team live was severely damaged, requiring them to evacuate.
Local brothers immediately arranged for temporary accommodations for those affected, and the Taiwan branch is helping to provide other necessities.
We pray that our affected brothers and sisters will have peace of mind during this distressing time, and that the brothers entrusted with caring for them will prove to “be like a hiding place from the wind.”—Isaiah 32:2.
On April 2, 2020, a Tajik military court in the capital city of Dushanbe sentenced Brother Jovidon Bobojonov to two years in prison for his conscientious objection to military service.
He will appeal his conviction.
On September 10, 2019, the Khujand City Court in Tajikistan sentenced Brother Shamil Khakimov to seven and a half years in prison for merely sharing his religious beliefs with others.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are appealing this case.
Brother Khakimov’s ordeal began in early 2019.
On February 26, authorities arrested 68-year-old Shamil, charging him with “inciting religious hatred.” Afterward, the court placed him in pretrial detention, which eventually was extended for six months.
In addition to dealing with this unjust prison term, Brother Khakimov suffers from high blood pressure and is still recovering from a medical procedure.
This is the first time one of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been imprisoned in Tajikistan since 2017, when 18-year-old Daniil Islamov was given a six-month prison sentence for refusing to wear a military uniform.
Tajikistan is now one of five countries that have imprisoned at least one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The other four are Eritrea, Russia, Singapore, and Turkmenistan.
We pray that Jehovah will continue to supply Brother Khakimov everything that he needs to endure this trial.—Romans 15:5.
Jehovah’s Witnesses released the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in the Laotian language at a regional convention held in Nong Khai, Thailand, on August 16, 2019.
Brother Plakorn Pestanyee, a member of the Thailand Branch Committee, released the Bible on the first day of the convention.
The three-person translation team worked for one and a half years on the project.
As one of the translators explains: “The result is a translation that expresses the message of the Bible in the common vernacular of Laotian speakers, and yet accurately conveys the meaning of the original language, so that students of the Bible can understand ‘the deep things of God.’”—Job 11:7.
The translation features useful study tools, such as an index that assists readers to easily locate specific verses and a glossary that explains the meaning of Bible expressions.
Another translator who assisted with the project states: “When we use this translation in our teaching, Bible students will understand important points much more easily than before, and it will reach their heart, helping them to cultivate love for Jehovah as a person.” We are confident the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures will help the Laotian-speaking brothers and sisters continue to be “fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—2 Timothy 3:16, 17.
A court in Turkmenistan convicted 26-year-old Brother Serdar Dovletov and sentenced him to three years in prison on November 12, 2019.
Brother Dovletov is one of ten brothers in the country who has been sentenced to prison for conscientious objection.
Seven have been convicted in 2019 and three were convicted in 2018.
Their prison terms range from one to four years.
Brother Dovletov is from the city of Baýramaly, Mary Region, in southeastern Turkmenistan.
His wife, Surya, and mother, Sonya, are also Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Brother Dovletov’s trial began on November 11, 2019.
Brother Dovletov told the court that he conscientiously objects to military service based on his personal religious beliefs.
Additionally, three doctors testified under oath that Brother Dovletov has a chronic duodenal ulcer that warrants an exemption from military service.
Despite the facts presented, the judge ruled Brother Dovletov guilty of “fraudulently” evading the draft and had him placed in a local detention center.
It is expected that soon he will join the other nine brothers imprisoned in the harsh Seydi labor camp in the desert of Lebap Region.
Brother Dovletov will appeal the conviction.
As our brothers in Turkmenistan continue to face injustice, we pray for them with full faith in the inspired promise that Jehovah will support their courageous stand of integrity.—Psalm 37:18, 24.
On April 19, 2019, for the first time in recent years, our brothers throughout the entirety of Uzbekistan were able to commemorate the Memorial of Christ’s death publicly.
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Uzbekistan are officially registered only in Chirchik, a city near Tashkent.
In previous years, our brothers living outside of Chirchik would commemorate the Memorial in secret so as to avoid potential police interference.
This year, the brothers informed the police of the Memorial observance and invited them to attend.
The police officers responded amicably and even took measures to ensure the safety of attendees.
In some areas, police officers attended the program.
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body delivered the Memorial discourse in a Kingdom Hall complex in Chirchik, as shown in the lead photograph.
The program was translated into Russian.
The total attendance was 781.
Later in the evening, two more Memorial observances were held at the same complex.
During the visit, Brother Sanderson, accompanied by Paul Gillies from world headquarters and two brothers from Central Asia, met with senior officials from the Ministry of Justice and the National Centre for Human Rights.
During the meetings, our brothers were allowed to present accurate information about our faith and organization.
It is hoped that well-informed officials will support registration in communities beyond Chirchik, which will help the brothers acquire appropriate facilities for worship.
Brother Mark Sanderson with fellow members of the delegation outside the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Uzbekistan The public Memorial observance and the respectful meetings with officials are the latest positive developments in Uzbekistan.
During the past six months, there have been no raids, fines, or arrests of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
And, approximately one year ago, on May 14, 2018, Mr. Javlon Vakhabov, the ambassador of Uzbekistan to the United States, publicly stated that parliament would work to change legislation to make it easier for Jehovah’s Witnesses to acquire registration.
We look to Jehovah to bless the efforts of our brothers in Uzbekistan as they continue to lead “a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness.”—1 Timothy 2:2.
In a six-month period beginning in March 2018, the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan and the Administrative Court of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous republic in Uzbekistan, decided in favor of Jehovah’s Witnesses in cases related to our freedom of worship.
The Supreme Court reversed four lower court rulings against our brothers, and the Administrative Court reversed a fifth decision.
Timur Satdanov, one of our brothers exonerated by a Supreme Court victory in Uzbekistan.
Several of the cases involving our brothers resulted from police investigations in which authorities seized Bible-based literature, as well as electronic devices that contained copies of the Bible.
As a result, lower courts found the brothers guilty and imposed fines on the basis of a law that can be interpreted as prohibiting the distribution of religious material.
Thankfully, these recent high court decisions exonerate our brothers from these guilty verdicts and exempt them from the fines.
Witnesses worldwide rejoice at these developments, grateful to the authorities and, above all, to Jehovah for his guidance and support ‘in the defending and legally establishing of his good news.’—Philippians 1:7.

Local Experiences: The manager of Ballarat Wildlife Park stated: “I can honestly say that in my 15 years working at the Ballarat Wildlife Park your group has by far been the most enjoyable and well-run group I have worked with.
A huge thanks to you and all of your wonderful guides.” A reservations manager commented about the 340 delegates who stayed at his hotel: “Everyone collaborates to solve problems.
It looks to me like it is just a giant family and everyone is talking to and supporting each other.
Seriously, it has been a joy to deal with everyone.
I have been working in the hospitality industry for 11 years, and this is the only group that I have found like this.” As a result of his interactions with Jehovah’s Witnesses, the manager attended the convention on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding in northeast Australia.
The floodwaters have displaced thousands of residents and caused major property damage and power outages.
The Australasia branch reports that, as a result of the flooding, 58 publishers from three congregations needed to relocate to the homes of family members or other Witnesses.
A total of ten homes of our brothers were flooded, two of which were destroyed.
The branch has established a Disaster Relief Committee, and the circuit overseer and local elders are shepherding the affected publishers.
We pray that our brothers and sisters continue to endure and be comforted under the care of these loving shepherds.—1 Peter 5:2
A Witness couple lost their home as a series of bushfires has burned more than one million hectares (approximately 2.5 million acres) across New South Wales and Queensland, Australia.
None of our brothers have been killed or injured in the fires.
Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls have been spared damage.
Local authorities suspect arsonists may have started some of the fires.
Since September, the fires have killed six people and destroyed at least 650 homes.
About 200 brothers and sisters had to evacuate, but they have since returned to their homes.
The couple whose home was destroyed are being cared for by other Witnesses.
The congregation elders are giving spiritual support to those affected by the fires.—Acts 20:28.
Tropical Cyclone Harold, a Category 5 storm, moved through the northern islands of Vanuatu on April 5, 2020, causing extensive devastation.
The cyclone continued southeast and struck the southwest parts of the Fiji islands on April 8, causing similar damage.
According to initial reports, none of our brothers have been injured or killed.
Some 280 publishers live on Espiritu Santo, the largest and most northern island of Vanuatu.
The island sustained major destruction of buildings and crops, as did other nearby islands.
In Fiji, the properties of approximately 260 publishers sustained major damage.
Water, electricity, and food supplies are limited.
The Fiji branch is coordinating the distribution of essential relief supplies.
Local elders are shepherding the affected brothers and sisters.
We are glad that our brothers affected by this cyclone are being cared for physically and spiritually.—Proverbs 17:17.
From May 10 to 19, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Israel made a concerted effort to participate in public witnessing in Tel Aviv.
The initiative was in response to the increased number of tourists who came to attend various cultural events in the city.
For example, from May 14 to 18, Tel Aviv hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, a music competition, which drew about ten thousand tourists.
Brother Gennadi Korobov, who assisted in coordinating the initiative, comments: “When we learned that there would be thousands of visitors to Tel Aviv for the music event, we saw this as a wonderful opportunity to increase our public witnessing activity.
We were thrilled to have a total of 168 publishers from 22 congregations throughout Israel volunteer.” The brothers set up literature display carts at eight locations from 9:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. each day.
To accommodate the many international tourists, the carts featured literature in ten languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish.
We are confident that there will be good results from this increased activity in Israel.
This effort is further evidence that Jehovah’s people praise him “at all times.”—Psalm 34:1, 2.
On December 5, 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) unanimously ruled in favor of 22 of Jehovah’s Witnesses from Armenia who were wrongly convicted of evading compulsory military service.
The ECHR awarded them a total of over $267,000 (EUR 242,000).
This is the highest monetary value the ECHR has awarded our brothers in a case involving conscientious objection.
In 2012, the brothers were convicted for conscientiously objecting to military service and for refusing alternative civilian service (ACS).
The brothers refused ACS because, at the time, it was under military supervision and was not truly civilian.
Therefore, all but two of the brothers served terms in prison prior to 2013, when Armenia enacted ACS that was truly civilian and stopped imprisoning our brothers for conscientious objection.
In handing down its December 5 decision, the ECHR relied on a victory Jehovah’s Witnesses obtained in 2017, the case of Adyan and Others v. Armenia.
The ECHR stated that Armenia was well-aware of that case with a similar fact pattern and should have entered into a friendly settlement with the 22 brothers.
Despite our brothers’ attempts over the past year, the government refused to accept a friendly settlement.
Thus, the ECHR unanimously ruled in favor of the brothers.
Thankfully, Armenia’s position on conscientious objection has vastly improved since 2013.
Our brothers are no longer imprisoned or saddled with criminal records for their neutral stand.
For the past seven years, Armenia’s truly civilian ACS has been a model for other nations to adopt.
However, the ECHR’s December 5 judgment holds Armenia accountable for its failure to comply with international law in 2012.
With this decision, the ECHR sends a clear message that it is willing to heavily penalize a country for violating international human rights laws.
We thank Jehovah for granting our brothers in Armenia this extraordinary legal victory.
We pray that it opens the way for our brothers in other lands to conscientiously object to compulsory military service and to have the option for alternative civilian service where it is not yet available, such as in Azerbaijan, South Korea, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.
On July 6, 2018, the Barda District Court of Azerbaijan ordered a one-year conditional sentence for one of our brothers, Emil Mehdiyev.
The court found 18-year-old Emil guilty of evading military service, but did not impose a prison sentence.
However, he cannot change his permanent address without notifying the authorities, and he is not allowed to leave Azerbaijan.
In December 2017, Brother Mehdiyev reported to the Barda District Department of the State Service for Mobilization and Conscription.
He refused to sign the draft notice, as his conscience would not permit him to perform military service.
In response to a summons, he returned to explain his conscientious stand and requested alternative civilian service in lieu of military service.
He was told that this option was not available and that his case would be sent to the Barda District prosecutor’s office.
After numerous hearings and adjournments, the Barda District Court convicted him and ordered the conditional arrangement.
Although the court did not sentence Emil to prison, he has no other recourse but to be viewed as a criminal because the government of Azerbaijan has still not instituted an alternative civilian service program, as it has long promised to do.
We are happy that Brother Mehdiyev is maintaining his neutral stand in the face of this difficult situation.—1 Peter 2:19.
On November 8, 2018, Azerbaijan’s State Committee for Work with Religious Associations granted Jehovah’s Witnesses full legal registration in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan.
Our brothers now enjoy a stronger legal basis to openly worship and preach in the city.
We hope that this positive development will provide a precedent for our fellow worshippers in other parts of the country to receive legal registration.
We are thankful to Jehovah that favorable government officials have legally established our worship in Baku.—Philippians 1:7.
From July 26 to 28, 2019, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Azerbaijan held their annual convention at the Darnagul Ceremony House in the capital city of Baku.
In this year of memorable international conventions, the regional convention in Baku was historic.
It was the largest public convention ever held in Azerbaijan and the first time Azerbaijani and Russian congregations from the entire country attended a convention at the same time.
Although Azerbaijan only has about 1,500 publishers, the peak attendance for the convention was 1,938.
A total of 33 were baptized.
Brother Mark Sanderson was allowed special entry into the country to deliver talks at the convention.
It was the first time a member of the Governing Body served a convention in Azerbaijan.
We are grateful to the authorities for granting this permission.
The unity of the brothers and sisters gave an excellent witness.
The administrator of the venue observed that during this convention he saw peace, love, and kindness among the Witnesses and that they really do practice what they preach.
Although Jehovah’s Witnesses still experience violations of religious freedom in Azerbaijan, authorities have progressively granted our brothers greater freedom to practice their faith.
In November 2018, Azerbaijan gave Jehovah’s Witnesses full legal registration in Baku.
This registration gives our brothers a stronger legal basis to openly worship in the city.
We rejoice with our brothers and sisters in Azerbaijan for these positive developments, including this recent milestone in their theocratic history.
We pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing on the efforts to ‘legally establish the good news’ throughout Azerbaijan and worldwide.—Philippians 1:7.
On October 31, 2018, the Ganja Court of Appeal in Azerbaijan upheld a lower court ruling to convict Brother Vahid Abilov, 19, for conscientious objection.
Although Vahid is not imprisoned, his one-year conditional sentence places several restrictions on him.
For example, he must report to a probation officer each week, and he is not allowed to leave Azerbaijan.
Vahid will now appeal to the Supreme Court, his last opportunity for justice in Azerbaijan’s judicial system. The challenge to our brother’s neutrality began in May 2017.
He had recently turned 18 and was required to report to the Aghdam District Department of the State Service for Mobilization and Conscription.
There he presented a written statement explaining that he could not serve in the military.
He wrote: “My Bible-trained conscience prevents me from taking up military service.
I do not evade, or even think of evading, the fulfillment of my civic duty.
I just kindly ask you to provide me with alternative civilian service instead of military service.” The authorities rebuffed Vahid’s wishes, and on July 9, 2018, indicted him under the charge of evading military service.
During the hearing in the Ganja Court of Appeal, Brother Abilov further explained his motives for objecting to military service.
He read Isaiah 2:4 to the court and explained that his personal examination of the Bible convinced him that he “should not even learn to fight.” Nonetheless, the court upheld his conviction.
It is yet to be seen if the Supreme Court will respect his wishes.
When Azerbaijan became a member of the Council of Europe in 2001, it committed itself to adopt legislation providing for alternative civilian service. The government has yet to do so.
As a result, our brothers regularly face the neutrality issue for their conscientious objection to military service.
Earlier in the year, an Azerbaijan district court found another one of our brothers, Emil Mehdiyev, guilty of evasion of military service and sentenced him to one year of probation.
He has also appealed his case to the Supreme Court.
Additionally, there are four cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights against Azerbaijan concerning our brothers who are conscientious objectors.
Despite these challenges, our brothers are continuing to rely on Jehovah to maintain their neutrality.—John 15:19.
In March 2019, the Supreme Court of Cassation of Bulgaria, the highest court of the land, issued favorable rulings in three cases involving our brothers.
These victories set vital legal precedents to protect our brothers’ freedom of worship throughout the country.
Two of the cases involved slander from media outlets.
In 2012, the newspaper Vseki Den published a libelous article about our beliefs.
Similarly, in 2014, station SKAT TV televised false reports about our organization.
In both instances, the media outlets denied our brothers’ requests to retract the negative statements.
After a series of court cases and appeals, the issues reached the Supreme Court.
On March 18, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled against SKAT TV.
On March 26, the Court used the ruling as a precedent to penalize Vseki Den, condemning what the Court characterized as the “language of hatred.” The third case involved the cruel persecution of our brothers by a political group called the VMRO-Bulgarian National Movement.
On April 17, 2011, our brothers gathered to commemorate the Memorial of Jesus’ death.
An aggressive mob of 60 people, organized by political leader Georgi Drakaliev of the VMRO, brutally attacked our brothers, inflicting injuries.
The brothers took the matter to the courts.
The case eventually came before the Supreme Court.
On March 20, 2019, the Court ruled against Mr. Drakaliev, who now must compensate the brothers.
We rejoice because of these three favorable rulings.
These decisions can now be used as a basis to protect our brothers’ freedom to “go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion.”—1 Timothy 2:2.
The revised New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was released in the Czech and Slovak languages on September 7, 2019.
The Bibles were released by Brother Stephen Lett, a member of the Governing Body, at a special meeting held in Ostrava, Czech Republic.
The special meeting included over 200 locations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with a total attendance of 25,284.
These releases are the result of over four years of work by each team of translators.
A primary benefit of the revised translations is that they are easy to read.
One member of the Slovak translation team states: “Many will find themselves immersed in the reading of Bible accounts.
The text is much more fluent and natural, so the reader will want to know how the story continues and will find it difficult to stop reading.” There are over 15,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Czech Republic and over 11,000 in Slovakia who will benefit from the releases.
A member of the Czech translation team explains: “The revised New World Translation puts emphasis on conveying the thoughts of the original-language text, using shorter sentences and modern language.
It will be more understandable not only for long-time Witnesses but also for young people and those who are new in the truth.” The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures has been translated, in whole or in part, into 184 languages, including 29 complete revisions based on the 2013 edition.
It is our prayer that these releases will help Bible truth touch the hearts of readers to an even greater degree.—Luke 24:32.
On July 19, 2019, Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body enthusiastically announced the release of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Icelandic at the international convention in Copenhagen, Denmark.
On Friday morning of the convention, the chairman invited all in the Icelandic-language field to meet in a small lounge within the stadium complex during the noon break.
During this special meeting, Brother Lett presented the Bible to the 341 grateful brothers and sisters who were in attendance.
For centuries, Bible translation has been an important part of Iceland’s literary heritage.
In 1540, Oddur Gottskálksson published the first translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Icelandic.
Since 2010, our Icelandic fellow worshippers have been using the Bible of the 21st Century, published by the Icelandic Bible Company.
Now, the brothers and sisters in the Icelandic field are eager to use the newly released translation to share the good news with the more than 300,000 people who speak the language.
A brother on the translation team states: “The translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures into Icelandic took almost four years.
What makes this translation unique is that it fully restores Jehovah’s name to its rightful place in the Scriptures.
This is in harmony with Jesus’ prayer recorded at John 17:26: ‘I have made your name known to them and will make it known.’” We are grateful for Jehovah’s continued blessing on our commission to preach the good news to the entire inhabited earth, which is largely made possible due to our translation work.
It is our prayer that many more will want to learn about “the magnificent things of God” as they read from his Word in the language of their heart.—Acts 2:11.
In July 2019, a new Bible museum opened at the Scandinavia branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, located in the town of Holbæk, Denmark, which is approximately 65 kilometers (40 mi) from Copenhagen.
The museum theme is “The Bible and the Divine Name in Scandinavia.” The museum brings together a unique collection of rare and significant Bibles in the Danish, Faeroese, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Norwegian, Saami, and Swedish languages.
More than 50 Bibles make up this display.
One of the most significant items is an original 1541 Gustav Vasa Bible.
It was the first complete Bible produced in any Scandinavian language.
The Gustav Vasa Bible became the standard for the Swedish language, establishing grammar and vocabulary.
It also became the model text for the Swedish Bible for the next 300 years.
An original 1541 Gustav Vasa Bible on display at the museum The 1550 Christian III Bible is another rare original on display.
This was the first complete Bible in Danish.
The Christian III Bible helped to standardize the Danish language, and it had a significant impact on a large part of Northern Europe.
An original copy of the 1550 Christian III Bible Erik Jørgensen from the Scandinavia branch office comments: “This new Bible museum demonstrates the deep respect that has existed for centuries in Scandinavia for both God’s Word and his majestic name, Jehovah.”

Local Experiences: Christian Tidemand Andersen, event coordinator for Brøndby Stadium, stated: “One and a half years ago we first began planning the Jehovah’s Witnesses International Convention, and from day one there has been an amazing dialogue between both organizations.
Through respect and mutual understanding for each other’s challenges in connection with a huge event like this, the entire planning was executed with a constructive approach to the entire project.
It is rare to meet a partner who is so well organized and has thought of every detail.
On the actual days of the convention, it was impressive to see all the volunteers who helped and worked from morning to night, and it was done with a very positive spirit and smiles on their faces.
It has been a great event to be a part of, and we would like to give a huge thanks for the cooperation from your Convention Committee and all the volunteers.
We hope to see you and your guests some other time here at Brøndby Stadium.”
HELSINKI—On Friday afternoon, August 18, 2017, one of our sisters was killed in Finland in what is being investigated as an act of terrorism targeting women.
In addition to our sister, the perpetrator killed one other woman and injured eight people in an attack that took place in a market square in Turku, a city on Finland’s southwest coast.
Immediately after the attack, representatives from the Finland branch office, the local circuit overseer, and local elders provided comfort and support to those affected by the tragedy.
Veikko Leinonen, a spokesman at the branch office in Finland, states: “This is a very tragic and shocking event.
We are especially saddened that one of our dear pioneer sisters was killed in this random attack while engaging in metropolitan public witnessing.
We know that, despite all precautions, it is not always possible to prevent ‘unexpected events,’ including acts of violence and terror.
However, we continue to comfort one another, particularly the family of the sister who was killed.
Our prayer is for Jehovah to grant inner peace to those who are grieving this painful loss.
We will also continue to take practical steps and not allow undue anxiety to overtake us while moving forward with our witnessing efforts.”—Ecclesiastes 9:11; Romans 15:13; Philippians 4:6, 7.
To provide emotional and spiritual comfort, the branch office sent a letter to all congregations in Finland.
The branch also organized a special meeting to provide encouragement for the 135 brothers and sisters who assist with the metropolitan public witnessing in Turku.
The pioneers have shown a courageous spirit and are eager to continue public witnessing.
Many living in Turku have been deeply disturbed by the fact that the attack took place in Finland, a country often described as one of the safest in the world.
As early as the day after the attack, our brothers listened empathetically and offered spiritual comfort while witnessing in the market square and in the door-to-door ministry.
The branch office in Finland is grateful to the global brotherhood for the many prayers and messages of support.
(1 Peter 2:17; 5:9) Most of all, we unitedly thank Jehovah, “the God who supplies endurance and comfort.”—Romans 15:5.
Brothers and sisters in Georgia welcomed attendees from 18 countries to the “Be Courageous”!
Special Convention held in the capital, Tbilisi, on July 20-22, 2018.
This theocratic event, the first ever in Georgia, was marked by rich spiritual food, warm hospitality, and displays of the region’s vibrant culture and enduring history.
The convention originated from the Olympic Palace, an arena located in Tbilisi, with a peak attendance of 7,002.
The program was streamed to approximately 80 other locations throughout the country, bringing the total attendance to over 21,500.
A highlight of the convention was the baptism of 208 new brothers and sisters.
In addition to the spiritual program, the delegates enjoyed exhibitions of Georgian culture.
Local Witnesses treated the visitors to performances of ethnic dances and music, tastes of the local cuisine, and tours of the ancient city of Tbilisi.
Tamaz Khutsishvili, a representative at the branch office in Georgia, stated: “The landscape of religious freedom in our country has not always been so favorable.
But in this case, with the fine cooperation of the local authorities, it was an unforgettable experience to have the opportunity to welcome so many of our brothers and sisters to enjoy this peaceful event with us.”—Romans 15:7.
In July 1948, in the German city of Kassel, Jehovah’s Witnesses held what was the largest gathering of Witnesses in Europe in the aftermath of World War II.
Jehovah’s Witnesses held an exhibition in Kassel on the 70th anniversary of that convention.
Over the 12 days of the exhibition, more than 2,000 people attended.
The event was also covered by a local German television station and several local newspapers.
Jehovah’s Witnesses who attended the convention in 1948 share their memories.
The historical Kassel convention had a peak attendance of 23,150 people, including 1,200 who were baptized.
Notably, most of the speakers and many attendees were concentration camp survivors.
In acknowledgment of this, the exhibition’s opening ceremony included a speech from the director of the Breitenau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, Dr. Gunnar Richter, who explained how Jehovah’s Witnesses suffered under the Nazi regime.
Brothers and sisters preparing the convention site, which had over 50 bomb craters The exhibition displayed photographs illustrating how Kassel was nearly destroyed in the hostilities of World War II.
When our brothers organized the convention, the authorities could only make available a meadow pockmarked with large bomb craters.
Brother Kurt Rex, who was present for the convention, described the almost four weeks of labor required to prepare the site: “The work was physically very demanding.
We first had to use buckets to get rid of the water that had filled the bomb craters.
Only after this was it possible to begin with the real work and fill the craters with stones and rubble from the destroyed houses in the neighborhood.
Leveling the ground was also hard manual labor, because we did not have any access to large machines or instruments for leveling.
Since it was raining all the time, we were constantly wet.” Despite incessant rainfall, our brothers carted some 10,000 cubic meters (13,080 cu yd) of stones and rubble.
A portion of the over 23,000 attendees of the convention.
In his opening address for the exhibition, Wolfram Slupina, a representative from the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany, described the spirit that impelled the brothers and sisters as they prepared for the convention: “After liberation from the concentration camps, they did not pity themselves or harbor feelings of revenge.

During a ceremony held on May 7, 2018, the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site revealed to an audience of some 200 people a plaque memorializing Brother Max Eckert who was imprisoned at the former Dachau camp for over two years before being sent to the notorious Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.
He never returned home.
Though Brother Eckert died in relative obscurity, he is now recognized publicly as a man of unshakable faith.
Recent photograph of the former Dachau concentration camp, where Max Eckert was imprisoned before he was sent to Mauthausen.
Mauthausen concentration camp, where Max Eckert died.
Records disclose Brother Eckert’s legacy of integrity.
He and his wife were fined as early as 1935 for speaking to others about their faith.
He later lost his job because he refused to carry a flag with a swastika.
In 1937, he became one of the approximately 600 dauntless Jehovah’s Witnesses interned in Dachau.
Over two years later, he was transferred to Mauthausen where at least 90,000 prisoners died from the brutal conditions.
On February 21, 1940, Brother Eckert’s wife received a telegram that unceremoniously announced: “Husband died today in the camp.
For further details contact the police.” He was 43 years old.
During her presentation at the ceremony, Dr. Gabriele Hammermann, director of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, explained: “The Bible Students [as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known] were persecuted because their beliefs did not allow them to become members of any Nazi organizations, give the Hitler salute, or participate in military service.” She further stated: “Former fellow prisoners [described] the attitude of the Bible Students with great respect and especially [emphasized] their steadfastness and willingness to help.” Brother Wolfram Slupina, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany, acknowledged that Brother Eckert was an obscure figure to many attendees of the ceremony, stating: “We do not even have a picture of Max Eckert.” But he added, the plaque succeeds in “acknowledging the steadfastness [Brother Eckert] showed and his religious conviction without compromise—even to death.” Without question, Jehovah remembers the faith and integrity of Max Eckert, as well as all other Jehovah’s Witnesses who have died for their faith.—Hebrews 6:10.
The Ravensbrück Memorial Site has organized a traveling exhibition entitled “Forbidden and Persecuted—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Ravensbrück Concentration Camp and in the Penitentiaries of the GDR.” It highlights the difficulties that Jehovah’s Witnesses faced in Germany under the Nazi regime (1933-1945) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany; 1949-1990), as well as the Weimar Republic (1918-1933).
(See box “ Persecution and Legal Challenges Under Three German Governments.”) The exhibition debuted on Sunday, April 22, 2018, at the Ravensbrück Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Fürstenberg, Germany.
During 2019, the exhibition will be featured in the German cities of Erfurt, Rostock, as well as in Potsdam, where it will be hosted in the parliament building for the state of Brandenburg.
A biography of one of the “double victims,” Adolf Graf, included in the exhibition.
The exhibition features 12 biographical displays of brothers and sisters who were “double victims,” having been persecuted by both the Nazis and the Communists of the GDR.
Also included are audio stations featuring recordings of stories and farewell letters from Witnesses who were condemned to death, as well as readings of newspaper articles and historical documents from the Nazi period.
The exhibition demonstrates that, unlike the tens of thousands who were imprisoned because of their ethnicity, political views, or perceived crimes, our brothers were imprisoned because of the conviction of their faith.
In a speech during the opening ceremony of the exhibition, historian Dr. Detlef Garbe explained: “From the beginning, the unwavering faith and confidence, the spirit of unity, and the uncompromising stand of Jehovah’s Witnesses made them a target of particular SS hatred.
Their unconditional confidence in the divine promise of salvation and their very pronounced sense of solidarity gave Jehovah’s Witnesses the inner strength to remain faithful to their conviction even in concentration camps.” Even today, when Jehovah’s Witnesses face opposition and government bans, such as is the case in Russia, they are confident that Jehovah will continue to sustain them.—Isaiah 54:17.
Throughout Germany, the clergy attempted to take legal action against Jehovah’s Witnesses, then known as the Bible Students.
As early as 1922, brothers were charged with “illegal peddling and refusal to pay peddling taxes,” and severe sentences were meted out to those found guilty.
Between 1927 and 1930, nearly 5,000 court cases involving the Bible Students were instituted.
In 1928, at the instigation of church leaders, the State Revenue Department retracted the tax exemption status for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.
The churches later openly admitted their goal was to negatively impact the Bible Students’ preaching work.
The brothers took the matter to trial and the courts later ruled in their favor.
In November 1931, Munich police banned the literature of the Bible Students in the region of Bavaria.
In February 1932, the government of Upper Bavaria upheld this ban, and in March of that year, the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior rejected the Bible Students’ appeal considering it “without foundation.”
On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany and immediately began restricting freedoms of assembly and press.
During a special preaching campaign to distribute the booklet Crisis from April 8 to 16, the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses were banned in Bavaria.
After the campaign, other states also banned the Witnesses’ work.
Many of the clergy supported Hitler and his persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
On April 20, 1933, in a radio broadcast honoring Hitler’s birthday, Lutheran minister Otto said: “The German Lutheran Church of the State of Saxony has consciously come to terms with the new situation and will attempt in closest cooperation with the political leaders of our people once again to make available to the entire nation the strength of the ancient gospel of Jesus Christ.
The first results of this cooperation can already be reported in the ban today placed upon the International Association of Earnest Bible Students and its subdivisions in Saxony.” By the summer of 1933, Jehovah’s Witnesses had been banned in the majority of the German states (a national law banning their activity was passed on April 1, 1935) and the building that was used as the branch office for Jehovah’s Witnesses at the time was confiscated by Hitler’s storm troopers.
The homes of brothers were regularly being searched, and many Witnesses were arrested.
By the end of World War II, of the approximately 25,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany, about 10,700 were persecuted by the Nazis, 2,800 were sent to concentration camps, and about 1,000 lost their lives.
Also known as East Germany, the republic identified itself as anti-fascist, yet their treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses was similar to that under the previous dictatorial government.
Between 1950 and 1985, more than 5,000 Witnesses were found guilty by the courts of “anti-state activities,” “state-threatening communication,” and “warmongering.” The average prison sentence for our brothers and sisters was five and a half years.
A total of 62 Witnesses died in custody in the GDR.
The exhibit at the Munich Documentation Centre for the History of National Socialism featured 60 panels that displayed documents and photos chronicling Nazi persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
From September 26, 2018, to January 6, 2019, the Munich Documentation Centre for the History of National Socialism hosted a special exhibit designed to raise the public’s awareness of the experiences of Jehovah’s Witnesses during the Nazi era.
The Centre shares the same property as the former headquarters of the Nazi party.
During the opening ceremony, Dr. Hans-Georg Küppers, Munich’s cultural advisor, explained the motivation behind the exhibit in his welcome address: “This exhibition is important because for a long time Jehovah’s Witnesses were not perceived as persecuted by the Nazi regime.
It is the aim of this exhibition to bring these [victims] back into the public’s consciousness.” The historical account of what our brothers in Munich experienced under the Nazi regime was presented on 60 panels filled with stories of courage, loyalty, and survival.
One panel related the experience of Martin and Gertrud Pötzinger, who were arrested and sent to separate concentration camps after just a few months of marriage.
They did not see each other for nine years.
Both survived, and Brother Pötzinger later served as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Therese Kühner was executed by the Nazis on October 6, 1944.
Another panel featured the story of Therese Kühner, who became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses (then known as the International Bible Students) in 1929.
When Germany banned the Witnesses, secret religious meetings were held in her home and she began covertly printing Witness literature using a hand-cranked mimeograph machine.
After the Nazis discovered her activities, she was arrested and accused of “publishing and distributing anti-state literature and demoralization of the troops.” Sister Kühner’s loyalty never weakened despite facing death.
She was executed on October 6, 1944.
Other displays highlighted the politically neutral stand of our brothers who refused to give the Hitler salute—an act that made them special targets of the regime’s unrelenting hate.
In 1934, Hitler vowed to eradicate Jehovah’s Witnesses, proclaiming: “This brood will be exterminated in Germany!” The Witnesses endured brutal persecution as Hitler attempted to carry out his sinister resolution.
Hitler and his party no longer exist, but our brothers now number over 165,000 in Germany.
We are grateful to Jehovah, who turns our tribulation into hope that “does not lead to disappointment.”—Romans 5:3-5.
Eighty years ago, a prison boat unloaded Minos Kokkinakis onto the Greek island of Amorgós in the Aegean Sea, where he would spend the next 13 months in exile.
Without a trial, a Greek court had convicted Brother Kokkinakis of violating a new law that forbade proselytism.
His arrest was the first of 19,147 arrests of Jehovah’s Witnesses from 1938 to 1992 for breaking the law that had been imposed by Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas.
During those decades, hundreds of Greek Witnesses braved physical violence, arrests, and prison terms for preaching the good news.
At about the age of 30, Brother Kokkinakis began a 50-year legal battle for the freedom to share his faith.
Arrested more than 60 times, he spent over six years in prisons and on penal islands, where he and other Witness prisoners endured unspeakable conditions.
At age 77, he unsuccessfully contested his final arrest, eventually taking his case all the way to the Supreme Court of Greece.
Brother Kokkinakis then applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that Greece had denied him religious freedom.
In 1993, 84-year-old Minos Kokkinakis won a resounding legal victory, marking the first time the ECHR convicted a country of violating religious freedom.
* The year 2018 marked the 25th anniversary of this historic decision.
According to one professor of public international law, Kokkinakis “is probably the most widely cited judgment of the European Court of Human Rights concerning the freedom of religion or belief.” The Kokkinakis decision established a legal precedent that is still relevant in an era when powerful governments, such as Russia, are trying to deny many of our brothers their right to worship without interference.
Brother Kokkinakis’ faith and persistence in the ministry is an outstanding example for our brothers and sisters who are facing opposition to their preaching work.
His integrity led to a powerful witness that still resonates today.—Romans 1:8.
^ par. 3 Minos Kokkinakis died in January 1999.
Wildfires, intensified by gale-force winds, have caused destruction to person and property outside of Athens, Greece.
At least 76 people have died and another 187 have been injured in the blazes, which are considered to be the deadliest to hit the country in over a decade.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Greece reports that none of our brothers have been injured or killed in this disaster.
However, all of our brothers in the affected areas had to evacuate and are currently being sheltered in the homes of those from neighboring congregations.
Additionally, four of the homes belonging to Witnesses sustained extensive damage and one was destroyed.
We are praying for our brothers who were affected by this disaster as well as those whose brotherly affection moved them to give shelter to their fellow Witnesses.
(John 13:34, 35) We know that Jehovah will continue to sustain our brothers during this ordeal.

Local Experience: A travel agent stated: “I’ve worked my whole life as a travel agent, and I have never seen anywhere in the world such a good way to organize and manage travelers.
I watched you yesterday, and I could not believe it!
You organized 2,600 people within a few hours in a manner that is better than many professionals.
But the most wonderful part is your smile.
Believe me, I’ve worked for years in this field, and I can discern when someone smiles ‘professionally’ from when they smile from their heart.
And you all smile from your heart.”
Medical professionals visit our booth at the SIAARTI conference in Palermo Many doctors have expressed appreciation for the worldwide network that our organization has established to provide information about medical and surgical treatment strategies to avoid blood transfusion.
Hospital Information Services (Italy), located at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Rome, is part of this worldwide network.
Late last year, representatives of Hospital Information Services (Italy) and local Hospital Liaison Committee members staffed an information booth at the National Congress of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI), which was held from October 10 to 13, 2018, in Palermo, Sicily.
Immediately after that conference, the brothers were also exhibitors at the Joint Congress of the Scientific Societies of Surgery hosted at the Rome “La Nuvola” Convention Center.
Such conferences are opportunities to provide up-to-date information related to bloodless medicine to many interested medical professionals at one time.
The conference in Palermo was attended by 2,800 anesthesiologists.
The conference in Rome, considered the largest surgical conference ever held in Italy, was attended by 3,500 surgeons.
Representatives from a variety of respected medical institutions also attended.
This included members from all of the Italian associations of surgeons and from the Italy Chapter of the American College of Surgeons.
Several national institutions, such as the Ministry of Health, backed the event.
Anesthesiologist Vincenzo Scuderi, from the Policlinico Hospital of Catania in Sicily, visited our booth at the Palermo event.
On January 18, 2019, he performed emergency treatment on a Witness patient affected by an aortic dissection.
He was able to complete the highly complex procedure without using blood.
Dr. Scuderi explains: “[Your booth] at the SIAARTI 2018 Congress was instrumental.
The presentation kit really was of great assistance.” Currently, over 5,000 doctors in Italy have agreed to treat patients who are Jehovah’s Witnesses with safe and effective medical and surgical techniques that do not require the use of blood transfusions.
Every year in Italy, an average of 16,000 Witness patients are treated in this way.
After the conferences, anesthesiologists and surgeons shared their experiences of working with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“For years Jehovah’s Witness patients have been a part of my professional experience.
Over the last few years, the Working Group for the docuanment on the refusal of blood transfusion of the SIAARTI Study Group on Bioethics has worked to provide guidelines to anesthesiologists, enabling them to take a unified position in the face of complex surgical and anesthesiological conditions with regard to the patient’s pathology and comorbidity.
The document makes it explicit that ‘the right of self-determination in relation to health care is a fundamental right of the person guaranteed by the Constitution (Articles 2, 13, and 32), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Oviedo Convention, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.’”—Antonio Corcione, coordinator of the regional transplant center for the Campania region, director of anesthesia and intensive care units at the Monaldi Hospital, former president of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) “My experience with Jehovah’s Witnesses motivated me and all my colleagues to refine blood-saving and postoperative management techniques in order to limit the need for transfusion support.
This path has certainly benefited some people who expressed their refusal of transfusions, but also allowed us to avoid transfusions in many other patients who were willing to accept them.”—Ugo Boggi, full professor of general surgery at the University of Pisa (Italy), adjunct associate professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh (USA), president-elect of the Italian Society for Organ Transplantation (SITO) “Liver transplant is the most complex of all.
It is two, three, or four times more complex compared to other transplants, and there is a high risk of bleeding.
Despite this, because we have scientific evidence from thousands of cases worldwide, with tens of thousands of liver transplant cases, we can say that we know the ‘tricks of the trade.’
They are, in fact, proven techniques that help to avoid bleeding.
We know how to avoid blood transfusions.
The vast majority of our liver surgeries, even transplants, are performed entirely without the use of blood.
In liver surgery, blood transfusions are now an exception because we have switched from a less precise surgery, which was used a few years ago, to a type of microsurgery that monitors each vessel.
I have to thank Jehovah’s Witnesses because they opened the way to something which we hadn’t paid much attention to 10 or 15 years ago—the blood-saving topic.”—Umberto Cillo, full professor of general surgery and director of the hepatobiliary and liver transplant unit at the University of Padua, president of the Italian Society for Organ Transplantation (SITO) “I appreciate Witness patients very much because the unshakable faith in their beliefs is admirable.
And this is one of the reasons why, over the years, I have always tried to make adjustments in order to please them.
I consider them people worthy of the highest regard.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are not people who want to die or be martyrs at all; they are people who look for quality medical care.”—Francesco Corcione, full professor of surgery at the University of Naples Federico II, president emeritus of the Italian Society of Surgery (SIC), honorary member of the Académie Nationale de Chirurgie, Paris, France “The relationship with Jehovah’s Witnesses further convinced me of the need for extreme respect that my profession owes to the cultural and religious convictions of patients.
I feel a lot of backing from the recent legislative recognition in Italy with Law 219 of December 2017, ‘Provisions for informed consent and advance directives,’ where it states that ‘no health-care treatment can be initiated or continued without the person’s free and informed consent.’ If the surgeon communicates with the patient in a competent, free, and responsible way, there will surely be advantages for both in terms of sharing responsibilities, increasing the degree of freedom, and ultimately a more adequate and effective treatment path.”—Luca Ansaloni, director of general and emergency surgery unit at the Bufalini Hospital of Cesena, president of the Italian Society of Surgical Physiopathology (SIFIPAC) “Jehovah’s Witnesses have greatly contributed to the refinement of treatment strategies that avoid blood transfusions.
New surgical technologies are instrumental in respecting the will of patients who for religious reasons refuse blood transfusions.
There are definite advantages to the cost-benefit ratio of bloodless medicine.”—Diego Piazza, president of the Italian Medical Association of Catania, director of oncological surgery at the Garibaldi-Nesima Hospital of Catania, former president of the Italian Association of Hospital Surgeons (ACOI) “The apparent ‘harmless’ nature of blood transfusions, their perceived easy availability, their relatively low cost, the ease with which they can be prescribed, and the possibility to immediately observe their effectiveness (in terms of increased hemoglobin levels)—all these aspects have contributed to their widespread use.
However, the evidence related to the possible harmful effects connected to the transfusions of both concentrated red blood cells and the other blood components has increased each year.
In fact, several studies have shown that transfused patients incur complications more frequently than nontransfused patients and worse outcomes with increased risk of mortality, morbidity (stroke, renal injury, thromboembolic events, infections, respiratory failure), and prolonged hospitalization.
I think that the treatment of Jehovah’s Witness patients over the past 50 years has led clinicians to greater awareness of blood conservation and of the progress in bloodless surgery.”—Giandomenico Biancofiore, director of the complex operative unit of anesthesia and resuscitation in transplants at the Pisa University Hospital, associate professor of anesthesiology and resuscitation at the University of Pisa
On April 6, 2018, the Court of Termini Imerese in Sicily, Italy, ruled that a surgeon was criminally liable for forcing a blood transfusion on a woman who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The surgeon was ordered to pay her 10,000 euros ($11,605 U.S.) in damages as down payment for compensation and another 5,000 euros ($5,803 U.S.) in compensation to her husband, who is also one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
This ruling is the first time an Italian court has found a doctor criminally responsible for violating the fundamental right to have control over what is done to one’s own body in line with one’s beliefs.
The case involved a sister who, after having gallbladder surgery in December 2010, began experiencing complications.
Even though she persistently refused to accept blood products, she was physically restrained and forcibly given a transfusion of red blood cells.
Her surgeon falsely claimed to have authorization from a magistrate.
Subsequently, she and her husband filed a criminal complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The court decided that in “the circumstance of a Jehovah’s Witness, of legal age and fully capable, .
the doctor must refrain from providing this treatment” if it violates the recipient’s will.
The court also declared that the Constitution of Italy prohibits doctors from administering treatments without consent even if the doctor claims that the treatment is necessary.
According to the court decision, “the justification of the state of necessity .
is not applicable in presence of a clearly expressed, free and valid dissent.” In his medical report for the trial, Daniele Rodriguez, professor of Legal Medicine and Bioethics at Padua University and expert witness, observed that “the right to refuse a specific health treatment is protected by regulations of constitutional rank and made explicit by [article] 32 of the [Italian] Constitution stating that ‘no one may be obliged to undergo a particular health treatment except under the provisions of the law.’”
Commenting on the court’s decision, Italian jurist and health law expert Luca Benci, wrote in Quotidiano Sanità (Health Daily): “There is no law that imposes a blood transfusion on dissenting patients.
The refusal of treatment prevails over all other aspects.” Marcello Rifici, a lawyer with the litigation team for Jehovah’s Witnesses, states: “We are pleased to see that this ruling is in line with established European standards, such as those codified by decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, that maintain the right to self-determination for all patients.
Interestingly, in 2017 the Italian Parliament established law 219/2017, known as the ‘Living Will Law,’ which underscores the same principles as this decision.” Lucio Marsella, also a lawyer with the litigation team, comments: “The ruling constitutes a precedent that stands as a guarantee for all the doctors who conscientiously and courageously strive to cure patients in the best way possible while respecting their dignity of choice.”
On August 22, a magnitude 4.0 earthquake struck the island of Ischia off the coast of Naples, Italy, destroying numerous buildings and displacing some 2,600 people.
Over 40 people were injured and 2 were killed.
No fatalities or serious injuries have been reported among the 633 Jehovah’s Witnesses who live on the island, but the homes of 9 Witness families were damaged.
Local Witnesses are providing assistance and spiritual comfort to their fellow members that were affected.

On May 15, 2019, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation, the highest court in the land, strengthened our brothers’ right to make decisions regarding their own medical care.
The Court confirmed that a patient has the right to select a health-care agent who will uphold the patient’s decision to refuse a blood transfusion.
Additionally, the Court confirmed that Italian law provides for the legal appointment of a health-care agent, even if, because of his health condition, he could imminently become unconscious or impaired in some way.
Brother and Sister Cappelli The decision was the result of a series of trials involving Brother Luca Cappelli, a congregation elder.
For the past 25 years, he has been afflicted by an abnormality of the blood vessels in the brain.
Brother Cappelli’s condition not only requires multiple medical procedures, but also at times impairs his ability to communicate.
In advance of his treatments, he conscientiously filled out an Advance Medical Directive and designated his wife, Francesca, as his health-care agent.
However, a judge and a court of appeal refused to appoint his wife as his health-care agent, thus depriving Brother Cappelli of the legal means to protect himself from receiving an unwanted blood transfusion.
Brother Cappelli’s case went to the Supreme Court of Cassation on February 16, 2017.
The Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts violated the Italian Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights, both of which protect patient autonomy.
Interestingly, the Court stated that refusing a particular medical treatment “takes on even stronger connotations, worthy of protection and guarantee, when [it] is part of and is connected to the expression of a religious faith.” With this ruling of the Supreme Court, Italian courts are now required to respect to a greater degree the measures our brothers take to avoid blood transfusions.
We rejoice as a united brotherhood that the Supreme Court has acted to protect the rights of our brothers throughout Italy, who continue to uphold their Bible-trained conscience regarding the use of blood.—Acts 15:29.
The plaque installed at the Risiera di San Sabba, Trieste.
Jehovah’s Witnesses in concentration camps wore the purple triangle on their uniforms On May 10, 2019, government officials, historians, journalists, and hundreds of other visitors attended the unveiling ceremony of a commemorative plaque in honor of the thousands of our brothers and sisters who were persecuted by Nazis and Fascists.
The ceremony was held at the Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, northeastern Italy, a former rice mill that became the only Italian concentration camp with a crematorium.
The unveiling drew the attention of local and national media outlets, including Canale 5, one of the most watched TV channels in the country.
Christian Di Blasio, a spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy, opened the ceremony with a discourse highlighting loyalty.
He stated: “Jehovah’s Witnesses were the only ones under the Third Reich to be persecuted solely on the basis of their religious convictions.
They were also the only ones, as a group, to have the opportunity to avoid martyrdom.
They merely had to renounce their Christian faith and support the regime.
Yet, they had the courage to stick to Christian values—loyalty to God and love for others.”
Brother Di Blasio then shared a video interview of Sister Emma Bauer, who recounted the persecution she and her family suffered during World War II.
She explained that true Christians will not relinquish their values even when faced with death.
In closing, the mayor of Trieste, Roberto Dipiazza, also addressed the audience.
He stated: “I am very pleased with this plaque.
We need to work so that such persecutions never happen again.” The plaque was then officially unveiled.
Many scholars and public figures commented on the significance of the event.
For instance, Giorgio Bouchard, former president of the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy, said: “No church has ever paid a blood tribute proportionately as high as Jehovah’s Witnesses did.
This harsh experience, however, has strengthened the movement, which presents itself to the judgment of history and, we believe, to the judgment of God, as the only Christian church that was opposed en masse to the idols of the Third Reich.” (For additional comments, see the box below.)
It is projected that some 120,000 people will visit the Risiera di San Sabba historical site annually.
Each visitor will have the opportunity to view this plaque in memory of the thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses who, despite being victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution, maintained their faith and political neutrality.—Revelation 2:10.
Sergio Albesano (Historian, Turin) I came to know about Jehovah’s Witnesses during my studies on conscientious objection in Italy, and I was quite impressed by their lifestyle.
Although I am a Buddhist, I respect them for the strength of their faith—a faith that allowed their many martyrs under Nazism not to fail in their religious convictions and even to sacrifice themselves so as not to renounce their religion.
Luigi Berzano (Sociologist, full professor, University of Turin; editor of the Annual Review of the Sociology of Religion)
It took too long for the Nazi persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be recognized and honored, despite the testimony of survivors and reliable historical documentation.
Finally, the great testimony of faith and civil values of the more than 25,000 Witnesses persecuted in Germany has passed the wall of silence.
What happened to the Witnesses was, and remains, a unique testimony, totally religious, and therefore, even more rich and noble than that of all the other victims.
Giorgio Bouchard (Former president of the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy) While the ministers of the “big churches” (Lutheran and Catholic) marched with strict discipline alongside the German troops up to Stalingrad [Volgograd], hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses died in prisons and concentration camps as martyrs to freedom of conscience.
No church has ever paid a blood tribute proportionately as high as Jehovah’s Witnesses did.
This harsh experience, however, has strengthened the movement, which presents itself to the judgment of history (and we believe, to the judgment of God) as the only Christian church that was opposed en masse to the idols of the Third Reich.
Giuseppina Celloni (Psychologist and psychotherapist, Trieste) For a long time, the persecution against this religious group under the Nazi-Fascist regime has been disregarded.
This identification plaque, posted at a historically significant site, honors the thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses who have had courage, loyalty, and faith in the noble Christian principles for the purpose of living in peace.
The Jehovah’s Witnesses who survived managed to overcome the trauma by pursuing the purpose of living in peace and exercising strong faith in a future “new day,” in which such suffering will no longer exist and no man will have to ask himself, ‘Why?’
Maurizio Costanzo (Journalist and television presenter, Rome) We cannot forget the thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses from various European countries who were sent to concentration camps.
Among these, 1,500 lost their lives.
On the other hand, it is not surprising that Jehovah’s Witnesses under Nazi-Fascism were persecuted, not for reasons of race, but for showing faith, peace, and political neutrality—things that were still considered unwelcome.
It is an important page in the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and it is therefore right to remember it with the highest of honors.
Annamaria Fiorillo (Deputy public prosecutor at the Milan Juvenile Court)
It is important to remember that Jehovah’s Witnesses posed a danger to Nazism because of their view of the world, based on respect for the sacredness of life—undermining the plan of world domination based on the principle of supremacy of the Aryan race.
Jehovah’s Witnesses, conscientious objectors who, at the cost of their lives, refused to renounce their faith—were not just martyrs of a religion.
Today, as back then, they can be defined as courageous champions of nonviolence and champions of peace.
They represent a glorious example of human greatness and a hope for future generations.
Anna Foa (Professor of Modern History, La Sapienza University, Rome) It was not until the 1990s that historiography began looking into the “purple triangles” and remembering their persecution.
In explanation, this lack of both knowledge and memory is largely due to the fact that, in postwar East Germany, Jehovah’s Witnesses continued to be persecuted.
Accused of being enemies of socialism, agents of American imperialism, and spies, they were imprisoned again—4,000 of them were sentenced to prison and 1,000 were imprisoned without trial.
Only after 1989 and the reunification of Germany did their story reemerge from oblivion and their persecution receive recognition.
This persecution included not only men but, as historian Adriana Lotto points out, also women who were mostly imprisoned in order to prevent them from influencing their children and pushing them to pacifism.
At the beginning, in 1933, they represented (second only to Communist women) the most numerous group in the camps, in particular, in the women’s camp of Ravensbrück.
There they distinguished themselves for their resistance, by refusing to perform jobs related to the army and to war (like sewing military uniforms or supplying vegetables to the SS), and faced heavy punishment and, in some cases, even the death sentence.
Maria Fausta Maternini (Full professor of Comparative Law of Religions, University of Trieste)
I participated with great interest in the poignant and touching ceremony at the Risiera di San Sabba, which emphasized the value of the testimony of Jehovah’s Witnesses who, in order not to renounce their faith, preferred to face death.
Today, as in years past, the ongoing mission of Jehovah’s Witnesses contributes actively to the dissemination of values that are a prerequisite for peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
I thank you for the invitation to attend the ceremony, and I express my appreciation for the incisive testimony that was given by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Marzio Pontone (Lawyer, Turin) I fought for 25 years in the courtrooms of the Italian military and civil tribunals for the “freedom of religious thought” for Witnesses.
I can affirm, without a shadow of a doubt, that they have three fundamental characteristics.
They are: (1) absolutely consistent, (2) loyal, and (3) unwavering in following and respecting what, for them, are the dictates of Jehovah.
Some Witnesses have even sacrificed their lives in order not to renounce their faith—the “purple triangles” are a demonstration of this.
I don’t think I exaggerate when I say that some Witnesses have been true “martyrs for the faith.”
I can only speak well of Jehovah’s Witnesses because I believe they are worthy of respect even by those who, like me, have another religion (Catholic).
Guido Raimondi (Former president of the European Court of Human Rights)
I am very grateful to the organizers of this important ceremony, which recalls the persecution and torture of thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses who were victims of Nazi barbarism.
We owe it also to their sacrifice that there was the powerful push in civil society that gave birth to the European project and also the European Court of Human Rights.
To them goes our emotional remembrance and our gratitude as European citizens.
Bruno Segre (Lawyer, journalist, founder of the newspaper L’Incontro, Turin) As promoter of the bills for the recognition in Italy of conscientious objectors to military service.
I had the opportunity to defend hundreds of young Jehovah’s Witnesses before the military tribunals of the Republic.
I can attest that the firmness of their faith, inspired by the principles of honesty, personal sacrifice, and solidarity, aroused my admiration.
The Imola facility, where the Translation Department is now located The Italy branch is relocating their facilities from Rome to the cities of Bologna and Imola.
Bologna is located about 370 kilometers (230 mi) north of Rome, and Imola is about 48 kilometers (30 mi) from Bologna.
Renovations have already begun on a nine-story building in Bologna that will serve as offices for the branch.
As of 2018, more than 60 Bethel volunteers working with translation and related support activities have been operating in a newly renovated building in Imola.
As part of the efforts to address the housing needs of the Bethelites relocating to Bologna, a seven-story apartment building with three levels of underground parking is currently being constructed about one and a half kilometers (1 mi) from the office building.
Additional housing will eventually be located in the same vicinity.
Artist rendering of the seven-story residence currently under construction In 1948, Jehovah’s Witnesses purchased their first branch property in Rome and moved operations there from a previous facility in Milan.
Since then, Italy has experienced extraordinary growth.
In the mid-1940s, there were fewer than 200 publishers in the country.
Today, there are over 250,000 publishers, the largest number for any branch territory in Europe.
As the number of publishers in the branch territory increased, so did the number of Bethel volunteers and branch properties.
At its peak in 2006, the Italy branch office included 99 different buildings.
Once the consolidation is complete, the branch will have a reduced number of Bethel family members and consist of only five buildings.
Our prayer is that Jehovah will continue to bless this project and that these new facilities will be a support for the work being done in Italy, a field that is “white for harvesting.”—John 4:35.

Local Experiences: A brother employed by a cleaning company contracted by the Jaarbeurs Hallencomplex received the following phone call from his operations manager: “We now have a group here doing everything agreed to—on time—tidying the building and arranging their own cleaning to keep things spotless.
They will probably return the building in better shape than when we handed it over to them.
Really incredible! I have never seen anything like this.
They even cleaned parts of the restaurant not in use now!
The restrooms constantly have two people on standby; and if anything happens somewhere, in no time, people turn up to resolve it!
I have never experienced this before.”
The North Macedonia branch initiated a special preaching campaign from August 1 to October 31, 2019, to share the Bible’s message with people who speak the Macedonian or Albanian languages in their branch territory.
North Macedonia has more than 1.3 million people who speak Macedonian and over half a million people who speak Albanian.
However, of the 1,300 publishers in the country, there are about 1,000 publishers in the Macedonian-language field and only 20 publishers who assist the Albanian-language field.
To support the local publishers, the campaign drew 476 volunteers from seven countries—Albania, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland—to North Macedonia to participate in the preaching efforts.
The Bible Teach book in Macedonian that the goatherd received ten years earlier During the campaign, one of our brothers met a goatherd on the road.
When the goatherd realized that he was speaking with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he reached into his bag and revealed a copy of the Bible Teach book.
He explained that he had received the book when Witnesses from Italy visited him during a special preaching campaign ten years prior.
He went on to say that he reads the Bible Teach book every day and has even memorized some of the chapters.
The brothers arranged for a return visit.
The outpouring of support from the Macedonian and Albanian-speaking brothers and sisters reminds us of Paul’s willingness to accept his assignment to “step over into Macedonia.”—Acts 16:9.

I take my hat off to the perfect logistics of this event.” Mr. Kamil Lubański, owner of KL Team, the company contracted to provide bus transportation, also related: “Right from the start of our working together, I could sense a very good atmosphere and working relationship from Jehovah’s Witnesses.
They are very involved and professional.
This very large event was well planned and prepared.
Our company has had the privilege of supporting many prestigious and government events that were organized on a national and European level.
However, it is rare to find a client that is so logistically and methodically prepared.
To summarize, our drivers and coordinators only have positive things to say about working with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
We hope that in the future we will be able to work together again.”
"Extreme temperatures combined with severe drought have contributed to the deadliest fire season on record in Portugal.
A total of 64 people were killed in June and another 45 in October, with a peak of 523 fires being reported in mid-October.
According to the European Union’s Emergency Management Service, this year wildfires have already burned nearly 520,000 hectares (1.3 million acres)—more than six times the country’s annual average of just over 83,000 hectares (205,000 acres).
According to the Portugal branch office, the fires claimed the lives of one of our brothers and his four-year-old nephew.
The fires damaged or destroyed some of our brothers’ homes, as well as farmland and equipment, and killed some of their livestock.
Local brothers and sisters have been busy helping one another to clean up the fire damage, removing burned trees and other debris.
A local Disaster Relief Committee was mobilized to provide practical assistance.
Additionally, two members of the Portugal Branch Committee joined local circuit overseers and congregation elders as they visited our brothers and sisters to encourage them.
We pray that Jehovah continues to surround our brothers in Portugal with the loving support and comfort they need to recover from the extensive fire damage.—Psalm 71:21.

"On Thursday, September 19, 2019, six brothers from the Russian city of Saratov were convicted and sentenced to prison simply for being Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Judge Dmitry Larin of the Leninsky District Court of Saratov sentenced Brother Konstantin Bazhenov and Brother Aleksey Budenchuk to three years and six months in prison; Brother Feliks Makhammadiyev to three years; Brother Roman Gridasov, Brother Gennadiy German, and Brother Aleksey Miretskiy to two years.
Additionally, the ruling states that after serving their time in prison, all of the brothers will be banned from holding leadership positions in public organizations for a period of five years.
The defense intends to appeal the verdict.
Criminal charges were first initiated against the six brothers after Russian authorities raided seven homes of Witnesses in Saratov on June 12, 2018.
All of the brothers have families, but Brother Budenchuk has two children who are still in school.
Brother Budenchuk, along with Brother Bazhenov and Brother Makhammadiyev, spent almost a year in pretrial detention after their arrest.
In their final words to the court, the six brothers quoted several inspiring verses from the Bible and said that they did not harbor animosity toward the prosecution.
Russia has now convicted and sentenced seven men to prison. Over 250 brothers and sisters in Russia are facing criminal charges, with 41 in detention (pretrial or prison) and 23 under house arrest.
We pray for all of our faithful and courageous brothers and sisters in Russia that they ‘may be strengthened with all power according to [Jehovah’s] glorious might so that [they] may endure fully with patience and joy.’—Colossians 1:11."
"As was announced on February 6, 2019, the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Oryol sentenced Dennis Christensen to six years in prison for engaging in peaceful worship.
The verdict is in the process of being appealed to a higher court.
The news of Christensen’s six-year sentence immediately provoked an international response.
Bodies within the Council of Europe, the European Union, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and other organizations have decried Russia’s unjust and unwarranted prosecution of Dennis Christensen.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a statement that said, in part: “The harsh sentence imposed on Christensen creates a dangerous precedent, and effectively criminalizes the right to freedom of religion or belief for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia.”
She urged the Russian government “to revise the Federal Law on Combating Extremist Activity with a view to clarifying the vague and open-ended definition of ‘extremist activity,’ and ensuring that the definition requires an element of violence or hatred.”
Ms. Bachelet concluded by calling on the authorities “to drop charges against and to release all those detained for exercising their rights to freedom of religion or belief, the freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.”
Two days after the sentencing of Brother Christensen, four well-known Russian human rights experts organized a press conference in Moscow.
The venue was filled to capacity, and over 6,000 people followed the hour-long program that was streamed online.
All on the panel defended Jehovah’s Witnesses as a peaceful people who pose no threat to society.
Press conference held in Moscow on February 8, 2019.
Also participating in the press conference were Brother Christensen’s wife, Irina; his lawyer, Mr. Anton Bogdanov; and a representative from the European Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Yaroslav Sivulskiy.
They made statements regarding the unjust verdict and responded to questions from the press.
Despite being in prison for almost two years, Brother Christensen continues to maintain his joy and his resolve to trust in Jehovah.
Just days before the final verdict, while delivering his final statement to the court, Brother Christensen noted: “The truth sooner or later becomes obvious, and it will be the case in this matter.”
After reading Revelation 21:3-5, he concluded with full conviction: “These words . . . describe the time when God will take care of justice and true freedom for all people.
Freedom and justice are closely related to each other.
God will make sure that all of this will be fulfilled.”
Brother Christensen must await the appeal ruling while in Detention Facility No. 1 in the Oryol Region—where he has been imprisoned for the past 20 months.
We will continue to pray that Jehovah give his unfailing support to Dennis Christensen, his wife, and all of our fellow worshippers throughout Russia.—1 Peter 3:12.

The video Russian Trial Called ‘A Litmus Test For Religious Freedom’ was produced by the international media outlet RFE/RL just days before the verdict was announced."
"Since April 20, 2017, when the Russian Supreme Court effectively banned the worship of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country, our brothers and sisters have faced relentless persecution and imprisonment.
Authorities have also progressively seized 131 of the properties owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses, with an additional 60 properties subject to confiscation.
The total value of the properties is estimated to be over $57 million.
One of the seized properties was the former Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye—a property that was owned by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
(See picture above on left.)
This property alone is valued at about $30 million. An additional 43 of the properties that were seized belong to foreign legal entities existing in Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States.
The seizures are illegal, since the Supreme Court decision banning Jehovah’s Witnesses did not give the government a legal basis for taking foreign-owned properties.
Jehovah’s Witnesses have filed a claim with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) concerning the illegal seizure of the former Russia branch property.
Regardless of how the ECHR rules, our trust and confidence are in Jehovah.
We pray that our brothers and sisters in Russia continue to be courageous as they refuse to let raids, arrests, or confiscation of meeting places stop them from worshipping Jehovah “with spirit and truth.”—John 4:23."
"On November 5, 2019, the Oktyabrsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced Brother Sergey Klimov to six years in prison.
Dennis Christensen is the only other brother in Russia to have received a sentence of this length.
However, in Brother Klimov’s case, the court imposed several additional restrictions, making his the harshest sentence imposed on one of our brothers since the 2017 Supreme Court ban.
Brother Klimov was arrested on June 3, 2018, after law enforcement, including special forces, invaded two homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Some 30 brothers and sisters, including an 83-year-old sister, were taken away for questioning.
All but Brother Klimov were released. Criminal charges were brought against him, and a court ordered that he be placed in pretrial detention for two months.
His term was extended seven times, meaning that even before beginning his six-year prison sentence, he has been incarcerated—separated from his wife and family—for a year and five months.
Lawyers for Brother Klimov will appeal his conviction.
Additionally, on August 20, 2018, the complaint Klimov v. Russia was filed with the European Court of Human Rights regarding his pretrial detention.
Throughout 2019, we have seen an increase in raids, arrests, and detentions in Russia.
Yet, our brothers remain undeterred. We are encouraged by the evidence that Jehovah is blessing our brothers’ full confidence in him.—Psalm 56:1-5, 9."
"On Thursday, May 16, 2019, the appeal hearing for Dennis Christensen resumed as scheduled.
The prosecutors and defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments, and Dennis was able to speak in his defense for nearly an hour.
Foreign diplomats and journalists were again present—an encouraging indication that, even though it has been two years since Dennis’ arrest made international news, the world remains keenly interested in his case.
Originally, the hearing was scheduled to last through Friday, May 17. However, the judges announced they would adjourn until Thursday, May 23 at 10 a.m.
Dennis will then be granted his last opportunity to appeal to the court before the judges break to deliberate.
It is difficult to project whether a decision will be announced by the end of the day on May 23, or if the court will schedule a future date to do so.
We take courage when we see our brothers, such as Dennis Christensen and Sergey Skrynnikov, maintain a positive disposition and express their sincere desire to remain faithful.
We feel the same way about our fellow Witnesses in Russia as the apostle Paul felt about the Thessalonians when he was inspired to write: “We ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships that you are suffering.”—2 Thessalonians 1:4."
"On March 1, 2019, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria overturned a lower court’s conviction of Brother Arkadya Akopyan.
He had been on trial for over a year, wrongfully accused of distributing “extremist” literature and ‘inciting religious hatred.’
Previously, a lower court sentenced 70-year-old Brother Akopyan to perform community service. This recent Supreme Court ruling dismissed the lower court’s sentence.
We thank Jehovah for this victory as we rejoice with Brother Akopyan. We continue to pray that our brothers will faithfully endure.—2 Thessalonians 1:4."
On December 13, 2019, Brother Vladimir Alushkin was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.
He was immediately handcuffed and taken into custody.
Brother Alushkin will appeal the conviction.
"As of today, Brother Dennis Christensen has endured three years of unjust imprisonment in Russia.
Since his arrest on May 25, 2017, some friends have asked Brother Christensen how this tribulation has affected his faith.
His answer has remained the same: “My faith has become only stronger.”
Brother Christensen relates: “I have experienced what is written in the Bible book of James chapter 1, verses 2 to 3: ‘Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance.’”
Remarkably, Brother Christensen’s faith, and even his joy, has grown amidst increasing hardships and disappointments.
Immediately after his arrest, Brother Christensen was placed in a pretrial detention facility not far from his home in Oryol.
In time, his wife, Irina, was granted permission to visit.
Brother Christensen remained in pretrial detention for just over two years.
In February 2019, Brother Christensen was sentenced to six years in prison. Three months later, his appeal was denied.
He was subsequently transferred to a prison some 200 kilometers (124 mi) away from Oryol, further distancing him from Irina.
For almost a year now, Brother Christensen has qualified to apply for early release, three of his four applications have been denied.
Despite these reasons for disappointment, Brother Christensen remains steadfast.
Brother Christensen humbly admits: “Irina and I are far from perfect, but we have learned to endure and to stay joyful under trial.
And what is most important is that we have drawn even closer to our God and Father, Jehovah.”
We pray in full confidence that Jehovah will continue to help all of our dear brothers and sisters in Russia to keep enduring persecution with joy.—Matthew 5:11, 12."
On Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 11:30 a.m., the Saint Petersburg City Court will hear our appeal against the December 2017 ruling that would allow authorities to confiscate our former branch facilities in Russia.
If the appeal is denied, the 14-building complex can be immediately confiscated by the State.
"NEW YORK—The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses arranged for a delegation of brothers from three continents to travel to Moscow to demonstrate the global support for the brothers and sisters in Russia.
When the delegation arrived, they were met by the happy faces of their Russian brothers and sisters, some of whom traveled to Moscow from as far away as Siberia.
The delegates assured the Russian brothers and sisters of their intense concern for them and the heartfelt prayers of the worldwide brotherhood.
One member of the delegation stated: “I was truly moved by the courageous attitude of my Russian brothers, especially as there was very little expectation of a reversal of the unjust decision to ban their activity.”
Despite the negative decision by the three-judge panel, an atmosphere of genuine love and unity pervaded the courtroom.
There was deep sadness at hearing Jehovah’s name reproached in such a public setting and a sober awareness that a time of testing lies ahead for the Witnesses in Russia.
Yet, the dignity and affection displayed by the brothers and sisters in the courtroom was sufficient evidence to refute the erroneous charge of “extremism” upheld by the appeal judges.
Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body, led the delegation.
He warmly encouraged the brothers to “be strong and courageous” in the days ahead.
As the visiting brothers left the courtroom, the local Witnesses embraced them and expressed appreciation for their support on this historic occasion.
The delegation also visited 21 embassies in Moscow to provide accurate information about the negative effects of Russia’s attack on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
These include cases of arson on homes of Witnesses, jobs lost, harassment of children at schools, and criminal charges for organizing Christian meetings against several elders, including Brother Dennis Christensen, who remains in pre-trial detention.
A number of ambassadors were visibly moved by a two-minute video that summarized these events.
The most common question asked by officials was, ‘Why Jehovah’s Witnesses?’
In answer, our brothers gave a powerful witness by explaining that individuals of our organization are politically neutral and our preaching activity has positively changed the lives of many Russians.
One ambassador responded: “The Orthodox Church does not like you fishing in their waters.”
More than ten embassies sent representatives to the court hearing and stayed for the entire 8-hour duration.
The international delegation of brothers left Russia with their faith strengthened, heartened by their Russian brothers’ determination to remain loyal and the opportunity to give an effective witness to officials.

"Two of the brothers recently placed under house arrest with their attorneys. Pictured from left to right: attorney Vitaly Svintsov, Vladimir Kochnev, Aleksandr Suvorov, and attorney Egiazar Chernikov.
On August 3, 2018, Judge Inna Yangubayeva of the Leninsky District Court of Orenburg, Russia, ruled to place Brothers Vladimir Kochnev and Aleksandr Suvorov under house arrest after they had each been imprisoned for 78 days.
On that same day at the Magadan Regional Court, Brother Konstantin Petrov was also placed under house arrest after being imprisoned for 64 days.
While we are thankful that our three brothers are no longer imprisoned, their trials are still pending, and if convicted, they could be sentenced for up to ten years in prison.
As of August 16, there are 9 Witnesses under house arrest and 25 imprisoned throughout Russia.
Another 30 brothers and sisters have been made to sign a document preventing them from leaving their hometowns without obtaining permission from local authorities.
We continue to pray for our brothers and sisters who are facing formidable circumstances in Russia.—2 Corinthians 1:11."
"On May 23, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Oryol Regional Court denied Dennis Christensen’s appeal and upheld the six-year prison sentence he previously received.
About 80 of our brothers and sisters attended the court proceedings.
Officials from Australia and Denmark were also present.
The results of this case are already being reported on by international media outlets.
Over the past three months since Brother Christensen’s original sentencing in February, there have been 115 home raids and three times as many criminal cases initiated against Jehovah’s Witnesses compared to the previous three months.
Our prayers are with Brother Christensen and all of our fellow believers in Russia.
We are confident that Jehovah “is near to all those calling on him” and will continue to help our brothers remain resolute in the face of persecution—Psalm 145:18."
"Brother Boris Burylov, aged 78, faces “extremism” charges in the city of Perm’
In May 2019, authorities from the Arkhangel’sk and Volgograd regions of Russia opened criminal cases against two of our elderly sisters.
Sister Kaleriya Mamykina, shown above, and Sister Valentina Makhmadgaeva, 78 and 71 years old respectively, are being investigated for “extremist” activity simply for being Jehovah’s Witnesses.
In April 2018, authorities in the city of Vladivostok brought criminal charges against 84-year-old Sister Yelena Zayshchuk, along with four other Witnesses.
There are now a total of ten brothers and sisters over the age of 70 facing criminal prosecution in Russia for their peaceful worship.
Although none of these older ones are in detention, the situation is no doubt extremely stressful for them.
If the investigations continue and the courts find them guilty, they could face heavy fines or imprisonment.
As of June 17, 2019, the number of our brothers facing unjustified criminal charges has reached 215.
That figure is still increasing.
May we keep all of our brothers and sisters in Russia in our prayers, at times specifically mentioning them by name.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to strengthen them “with all power according to his glorious might” so that they “may endure fully with patience and joy.”—Colossians 1:11."
"On March 25, 2020, the Penza Regional Court overturned the conviction of Brothers Vladimir Alushkin, Vladimir Kulyasov, Andrey Magliv, and Denis Timoshin, as well as Sisters Tatyana Alushkina and Galiya Olkhova.
Their cases will be sent for retrial.
As a result of winning the appeal, Brother Alushkin will be released from prison in the coming days.
He and the others will remain under travel and other restrictions as they await retrial."
"The case against Dennis Christensen, held at the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Oryol, has concluded, and the judge has scheduled the verdict to be issued on Wednesday, February 6, 2019.
Brother Christensen has been detained since his arrest on May 25, 2017. His criminal trial began on February 19, 2018.
If convicted, the prosecution has requested that Brother Christensen be imprisoned for six and a half years.
Despite being imprisoned for over 20 months, Brother Christensen has remained in good spirits, fully trusting in Jehovah and grateful for the prayers of the worldwide brotherhood.—2 Thessalonians 3:1, 2."
"On February 6, 2019, a Russian court announced that Dennis Christensen is guilty of “organizing the activity of an extremist organization.”
He has been sentenced to six years in prison.
The unjust verdict, which has already received international attention, will be appealed.
We will pray for Dennis Christensen and his wife, Irina, and our many brothers and sisters in Russia as they continue to ‘keep calm and show trust’ in Jehovah.—Isaiah 30:15."
On June 23, 2020, the Lgovskiy District Court in the Kursk Region granted Brother Dennis Christensen early release.
At the prosecution’s request, the judge mitigated the remainder of Brother Christensen’s sentence to a fine of 400,000 rubles ($5,759 U.S.).
The decision will take effect in ten days, after which he will be able to go home to his wife, family, and fellow worshippers.
All praise goes to Jehovah!
On February 18, 2020, the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court in Khabarovsk, Russia, convicted Brother Yevgeniy Aksenov and gave him a two-year suspended prison sentence.
If during those two years, Brother Aksenov changes his place of residence or is found guilty of any criminal activity, he will be sent to prison.
For the first six months of his term, he is on probation and must register with the local authorities monthly.
Additionally, for the duration of his probation, he cannot travel outside of his home city of Khabarovsk and he is not allowed to leave his home in the evenings. Brother Aksenov will appeal his conviction.
"Just nine days after Dennis Christensen was unjustly convicted in a Russian court, at least seven of Jehovah’s Witnesses were subjected to physical abuse—electric shocks, suffocation, and beatings—by Russian investigators in the western Siberian city of Surgut.
While torturing our brothers, the officers demanded to know the locations of their meetings and the identity of other Witnesses.
The incident began when authorities in Surgut carried out raids in the early morning hours of February 15, 2019.
After arresting some Witnesses and taking them to the Investigative Committee offices.
The authorities began interrogating our brothers, who refused to disclose details about their fellow worshippers.
After the only legal representative present left, the victims report that the following occurred: agents put a bag over their head and sealed it with tape, tied their hands behind their back, and beat them.
After stripping the Witnesses naked and dousing them with water, the agents shocked them with stun guns.
This sadistic torture lasted for about two hours.
At least three Witnesses are still imprisoned.
Those who have been released sought medical attention for their injuries and filed complaints with supervisory agencies.
Additionally, after the mass searches were completed, the Russian authorities initiated criminal cases against a total of 19 Witnesses for so-called “participating in extremist activity” and “organizing an extremist organization.”
Such an egregious abuse of authority is punishable under the Russian Criminal Code.
Additionally, the Russian Federation is subject to several international bodies that protect individuals from torture.
Therefore, we will pursue all available legal remedies, both domestic and international, for this crime.
Ultimately, we know that Jehovah has seen the persecution of our brothers in Russia and will act as their ‘helper and rescuer.’—Psalm 70:5."
"On Thursday, May 3, 2018, the Saint Petersburg City Court upheld the original December 2017 decision, allowing the Russian government to immediately confiscate our former Russia branch facilities in Solnechnoye.
Although we cannot stop Russia from seizing the property, today’s ruling is part of an application that is already being considered by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
The ECHR has communicated to the Russian government that our application is being considered as a matter of priority.
We keep in expectation of Jehovah, the God of all justice, to correct matters in his own due time.—Isaiah 30:18."
"A United Nations (UN) panel of human rights experts has issued a 15-page opinion concluding that Russia violated international law by arresting and detaining 18 Jehovah’s Witnesses in different cities from May 2018 to July 2019. Ultimately, the panel demands the immediate and unconditional release of those Witnesses who are still detained.
An advance copy of the panel’s opinion was released on May 15, 2020. The final version will be available on the UN’s website soon.
This is the third time in the past year that the panel, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has issued such a conclusion in favor of our fellow believers.
In its latest opinion, the Working Group condemns numerous aspects of Russia’s overt maltreatment of our brothers and sisters.
Addressing the authorities’ use of “extraordinary force” when arresting the Witnesses, the Working Group concludes that “there were no grounds justifying such action on behalf of the police”.
They emphasize that “none of [the Witnesses] should have been arrested and held in pretrial detention and no trial of any of them should take or should have taken place.”
The panel categorically refutes the charge of so-called extremist activity.
It explains that the brothers and sisters have done nothing more than observe “the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of religion.”
In the opinion, the rights experts also denounce the courtroom tactics used to try our brothers.
For example, during their pretrial detention extension hearings, two of the sisters were kept in cages in the courtrooms.
As the Working Group explains, international law recognizes the right of all persons “to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in accordance with the law.”
For that reason, our sisters should not have been “shackled or kept in cages during trials or otherwise presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals.”
The Working Group demands that Russia expunge the criminal records of all 18 Witnesses and compensate them in accordance with international law.
Further, the country is called upon to “ensure a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty” and “take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of [the Witnesses’] rights.”
The opinion notes that the 18 Witnesses are “part of a now ever-growing number of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia who have been arrested, detained, and charged with criminal activity on the basis of mere exercise of freedom of religion.”
A right protected by an international covenant to which Russia is a party.
Therefore, although the present opinion focuses on the 18 named brothers and sisters, the Working Group was unequivocal that the findings “apply to all others in similar situations.”
The Working Group’s call to action does not guarantee that our brothers and sisters in Russia will be exonerated, but there is hope that it may improve the situation.
We await Russia’s response.
In the meantime, as our brothers and sisters in Russia courageously endure persecution, we know our loving Father, Jehovah, will continue to fill them with joy and peace for trusting in him.—Romans 15:13."
On Tuesday, June 9, 2020, the Pskov City Court convicted 61-year-old Brother Gennady Shpakovskiy and sentenced him to six and a half years in prison.
He was immediately taken to prison from the courtroom.
This is the longest sentence handed down to one of our brothers since the 2017 Russian Supreme Court ruling that effectively criminalized our activity.
Brother Shpakovskiy will appeal the conviction.
"Judge Oleg Golovashko of the Prohladniy District Court in Russia announced the verdict in the case against Brother Arkadya Akopyan on Thursday, December 27.
The court sentenced Brother Akopyan, a 70-year-old retired tailor, to 120 hours of community service based on the absurd accusation that he allegedly commissioned non-Witnesses to distribute extremist literature.
While Brother Akopyan was not sentenced to prison, this conviction is a gross violation of human rights.
Therefore, the ruling will be appealed to a higher court.
In the coming weeks, we anticipate a judgment on the case involving Dennis Christensen.
We pray that Jehovah continues to support and comfort our brothers and sisters in Russia who are facing imprisonment for their faith.—2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17."
"The Vilyuchinsk City Court is expected to announce its verdict in the trial involving Brother Mikhail Popov and his wife, Sister Yelena Popova, on Thursday, February 13, 2020.
The couple was arrested on July 30, 2018, in Kamchatka and were released on August 9, 2018. They have been charged with engaging in “extremist activity.”
Mikhail and Yelena are relying on Jehovah as they face this distressing trial. We are confident that he will continue to be a “refuge and strength” for them.—Psalm 46:1."
"Brother Vladimir Alushkin was released from prison and reunited with his wife on March 30, 2020.
His release was the result of the previously reported March 25 decision by the Penza Regional Court.
The ruling overturned the conviction of Brothers Vladimir Alushkin, Vladimir Kulyasov, Andrey Magliv, and Denis Timoshin, as well as Sisters Tatyana Alushkina and Galiya Olkhova.
The Penza Regional Court returned the case to the original court for consideration by a different judge.
In the meantime, all six remain under travel and other restrictions.
Although we are pleased to hear Brother Alushkin was released, just two days later another one of our brothers was convicted for his faith in far northeastern Russia.
As long as these baseless legal attacks continue, we know that our brothers and sisters in Russia will keep close in mind the words at Nahum 1:7: “Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of distress. He is mindful of those seeking refuge in him.”"
"The Pskov City Court will announce its verdict on June 8, 2020, in the trial involving 61-year-old Brother Gennady Shpakovskiy.
He is being accused of “extremist” activity simply for holding small Christian meetings in his home, the prosecution has asked the court to sentence Brother Shpakovskiy to seven and a half years in prison.
In early 2018, Federal State Security (FSB) agents wiretapped the Shpakovskiy’s apartment and monitored their activity for several months.
On June 3, 2018, at 12:45 p.m., FSB agents supported by armed National Guard officers forced open the front door of their apartment, where people were gathered for a peaceful meeting, and searched the home for six hours.
The FSB agents confiscated tablets and cell phones and took the Witnesses away for interrogation.
The interrogators insulted the Witnesses and threatened them with dismissal from work and criminal prosecution.
Brother Shpakovskiy’s interrogation lasted until 10 p.m.
On March 19, 2019, Brother Shpakovskiy was charged with organizing the activities of an “extremist” organization.
Five months later, the accusation of “financing extremist activities” was added to the criminal charge.
As the verdict approaches, we pray in full confidence that Jehovah will help the Shpakovskiy family remain strong, knowing that their faithful endurance will be rewarded.—2 Chronicles 15:7."
"On September 2, 2019, the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Khabarovsk, Russia, sentenced Brother Valeriy Moskalenko to two years and two months of community service and another six months of probation.
He will not need to spend any additional time in prison.
After the verdict was announced, Brother Moskalenko was released from custody to the delight of his family and friends. He had been in jail since August 2, 2018.
Before his arrest, he worked as an assistant train conductor while caring for his sick mother.
Under the terms of his probation, he cannot travel outside Khabarovsk and must report for a criminal-executive inspection every month.
In his closing statement to the court on August 30, Brother Moskalenko said in part: “It is completely unthinkable for me to go against the will of God that is clearly expressed in the Bible.
And regardless of how I might be pressured or punished, even if I were sentenced to death, I declare that not even then would I abandon the almighty Creator of the universe, Jehovah God.”
Yaroslav Sivulskiy, a representative from the European Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses, states: “While we do not agree with the guilty verdict, we are glad that Valeriy can return home.”
In addition to Brother Moskalenko, seven more of our brothers in the Khabarovsk Territory are awaiting verdicts in their criminal cases.
We are thankful to Jehovah that Brother Moskalenko maintained his strong faith during his detention.
We pray that He will continue to supply strength to all the brothers and sisters who are enduring persecution for their Bible-based convictions.—Isaiah 40:31."
"On August 13, 2019, the appeals court in the city of Kirov ruled to release 26-year-old Brother Andrey Suvorkov from house arrest.
Although Brother Suvorkov has been given greater freedom, the criminal case against him remains open.
As previously reported, Brother Suvorkov was arrested, along with his stepfather and three other brothers, when local police and masked special forces raided 19 homes in Kirov on October 9, 2018.
Thinking back to when his home was searched, Brother Suvorkov states: “Many of our valuable items were confiscated.
But my wife and I didn’t worry about it, since we always tried to keep our life simple and not get too attached to material things.
The counsel from Matthew 6:21, ‘for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also,’ helped us remain calm.”
Following the raids, criminal cases were opened against Brother Suvorkov, his stepfather, and the three other brothers for singing Kingdom songs, studying religious literature, and possessing a copy of the Russian New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
They were all detained in a temporary holding facility as they waited for a court to decide either to release them or place them in pretrial detention.
Brother Suvorkov describes his experience: “I spent two nights in a temporary holding facility.
In the beginning, I did not stop praying. I was sure that Jehovah heard me and would give me support.
I recalled melodies from the Kingdom songs and sang them. Later, I recalled more than 50 melodies with lyrics.”
The court decided to place Brother Suvorkov and the others in pretrial detention.
During his first week in detention, Brother Suvorkov focused on helping others.
He recalls: “I decided to mention brothers by name in my prayers and write encouraging letters to those whose addresses I remembered.
This brought me joy.”—Acts 20:35.
As the months went by, all the brothers were eventually transferred to house arrest, except for Brother Andrzej Oniszczuk.
Brother Suvorkov is the first of the brothers from Kirov to be released from house arrest.
“Looking back,” states Brother Suvorkov, “I’m very glad that I had such an experience in prison. . . .
I don’t know what the future holds or if I will be imprisoned again.
I now have confidence that I will receive the support of Jehovah and his organization, even if I am in prison.
What I don’t have is the fear of being imprisoned.”"
"On September 3, 2019, Brother Andrzej Oniszczuk was released from a Russian prison.
He had been incarcerated since October 9, 2018, for merely practicing his faith.
During that time, he was held in solitary confinement and was not allowed to see or speak with his wife, Anna.
Though he can return home, he remains under restrictions, which severely limit his travel.
His criminal case is still in progress.
We rejoice that Brother Andrzej Oniszczuk and his wife are maintaining strong faith during this ordeal.
We are thankful that Jehovah responds to all the prayers in behalf of those in “prison bonds.”—Colossians 4:2, 3."
"On April 1, 2019, the same Russian court that sentenced Brother Dennis Christensen to six years in prison convicted 56-year-old Sergey Skrynnikov for practicing his faith as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The court imposed a large fine of $5,348.00 (RUB 350,000; EUR 4,758.95).
No prison time was ordered, although the prosecution was seeking three years of detention.
Brother Skrynnikov and his wife, Nina, have one daughter.
They assist their daughter and her husband with their five children.
Additionally, the Skrynnikovs are the primary caregivers for Nina’s elderly parents.
In court, Brother Skrynnikov made a respectful and compelling defense of his faith.
He said, in part: “If you look at the current situation from an unbeliever’s viewpoint, you might despair. . . .
But as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I look at this situation through the eyes of faith.
If God permits me to be convicted, it means that I need to view these three years not as a punitive sentence but as a special assignment to serve in a new location!
So I do not despair. . . .
God is one and the same whether we are free or in prison.
Therefore, we are not abandoned.
He is with us everywhere as long as we stay faithful to him.”
We are encouraged by the strong faith of our fellow believers, such as Brother Skrynnikov.
When we think of the severe trials they are facing, we echo the apostle Paul’s prayerful words: “May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him, so that you may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.”—Romans 15:13.
Translated from Russian
First, I would like to express my gratitude to Presiding Judge Gleb Borisovich Noskov for not imposing [pretrial] imprisonment on me, which meant that I have been with my family the entire time.
Also I wish to thank all of the clerks for their work.
I offer special thanks to the prosecutor, Madam Nadezhda Gennadiyevna Naumova, because no undue pressure was exerted on me and the questioning was conducted properly.
I would also like to thank my lawyers, Madam Irina Aleksandrovna Krasnikova and Mr. Anton Nikolayevich Bogdanov, for the tremendous work they have done.
I confess to being very surprised when they managed to bring in a specialist from Chelyabinsk.
Thanks to all of you dear friends, for coming to all the sessions to encourage me, even though it was known that the sessions would be closed.
Thank you to my mother, who, in spite of poor health, came to the court sessions to support me.
Thank you to my beloved wife, who for the past 37 years has supported me during good times and those more difficult moments.
Of course, the greatest gratitude goes to my beloved God, Jehovah, who has filled my heart with peace and joy.
You may find it hard to believe, but in my heart there is no shadow of discontent or resentment about what has happened to me, only joy and peace.
Second Corinthians 4:8, 9 is Bible prophecy being fulfilled in my case: “We are hard-pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed.”
This tells us that not only will God’s servants be hard-pressed and persecuted, but also that the work that the Lord Jesus entrusted to them will not just continue, but will gain momentum and expand.
These words apply to all who consider themselves followers of Christ:
Matthew 28:19, 20 tells us to “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.
And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”
Jehovah’s spirit continually leads Christians, giving them power beyond what is normal and thus helping them to perform their God-assigned tasks despite the pressures they face.
We become even more convinced of this when we take a look at the past. In the 1930’s, God’s servants faced what seemed to be an impossible task, that of covering the entire Soviet Union with the message about God’s Kingdom.
But since the preaching work is directed by Christ, he arranged matters so that in the early 1950’s the Soviet government itself sent thousands of families of Jehovah’s Witnesses to Siberia into the farthest corners of the country without charge.
It has been [more] than 60 years since then and what have we seen happen?
Officials throughout Siberia have been astounded when they have seen how the preaching work has spread.
One analyst who is familiar with the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the USSR expressed it this way:
“Fighting against Jehovah’s Witnesses is like blowing on dandelions.
The stronger the force that is used against them, the more seeds fly and the farther they go.”
Today that same situation with Jehovah’s Witnesses is being repeated.
Whom do we meet when we preach from house to house?
Housewives and pensioners.
It is difficult to find working people at home.
It is also difficult and sometimes impossible to get into high-security buildings, prisons, courts, and prison colonies.
But the preaching campaign is directed by Christ and he [Jehovah] has put it into the mind and heart of the Ministry of Justice to carry out His will.
In the end, the Ministry of Justice, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, the prosecutor’s offices, and other law-enforcement agencies have seen to it by their direct and active involvement in the preaching campaign of Jehovah’s Witnesses. How?
Because of their actions, from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands; from Arkhangel’sk to Crimea, and Yalta; within families, at workplaces, in prisons, courts, and correctional colonies, the name of the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah God, is being proclaimed.
We as Jehovah’s Witnesses could never have dreamed that this campaign would reach such magnitude.
So now a new door has opened for the ministry in what are essentially new circumstances and new places.
For Jehovah’s Witnesses to preach the good news in new places is truly a great honor.
And it is the prosecutor’s office that is making this possible.
Let us take a look into the future.
If for another ten years or so the government keeps putting Jehovah’s Witnesses in prisons and correctional colonies, there will be about 200 of them in each penal facility.
Imagine four congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses in one prison!
The prison administrators will be begging the Ministry of Justice to set Jehovah’s Witnesses free.
What do you imagine the majority of Witnesses would pray for?
“Lord, don’t soften the heart of the administrator; don’t let him set me free.
I have so many Bible students and sincere people to talk to in here.”
If you were to look at the current situation from an unbeliever’s viewpoint, you might despair.
You might say: “I have not killed anyone, robbed anyone, stolen from anyone.
I have not even quarreled with anyone.
This evidence is in the reports from the rural administration and from the district inspector.
Nevertheless, the prosecution is asking that I serve three years in a prison colony.”
This would seem to be the time to despair; but as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I look at this situation through the eyes of faith.
If God permits me to be convicted, it means that I need to view these three years not as a punitive sentence but as a special assignment to serve in a new location!
So I do not despair.
Rather, I view it as a great privilege, the privilege to serve God where there are as yet no Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The mass media has already plowed this territory very well in preparation.
Now is the time to sow.
God is one and the same whether we are free or in prison.
Therefore, we are not abandoned.
He is with us everywhere as long as we stay faithful to him.
In my case I am confident that God is taking my physical and spiritual health into consideration and, if it pleases him, he will put it in the presiding judge’s mind and heart to grant your petition regarding my sentence, Madam Naumova.
I am looking forward to April 1st.
Hebrews 13:6 assures me: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can man do to me?”
Jehovah God himself will help me.
Of whom should I be afraid?
"On September 4, 2019, during the trial of six Jehovah’s Witnesses in Saratov, a well-known religious scholar and state advisor to the Russian Federation, Sergey Igorevich Ivanenko, was invited to testify under oath on behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Dr. Ivanenko is the author of two scholarly works on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia.
The following excerpts were taken from the testimony he gave under oath:
The religious life and practices of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“One thing makes Jehovah’s Witnesses unique:
They do not rely on strict rules or the authority of any particular leader, instead, they try to help adherents develop a Bible-trained conscience so that each individual can personally and voluntarily make decisions guided by the Bible.
“Jehovah’s Witnesses try to follow what is written in the Bible, in harmony with the principles set out by Jesus Christ and his disciples back in the first century of the Common Era.
“With respect to the joint profession of their faith as manifested in studying the Bible, answering questions on Bible topics and singing songs that are also based on Bible texts, it is clear that Jehovah’s Witnesses make a concerted effort to base everything on the Bible.
“They also believe that a Christian’s religious life must include a congregation.
Here too, Jehovah’s Witnesses analyze the New Testament, what is said about Jesus Christ and his disciples, his followers, and the early stages of the development of the Christian church. . . .
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that their religious life must take place as part of a religious congregation.
“They emphasize that disciples of Jesus Christ would be identified by the love they have among themselves.”
The preaching activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Jehovah’s Witnesses are distinguished by their active preaching.
I would put Jehovah’s Witnesses in first place when it comes to their preaching activity and zeal.
Every believer must preach and spend some time preaching.
“They generally say, ‘Here is what the Bible says.’
A person can take the Bible and check for himself.
If he agrees, he will join them.
If he disagrees, he will not join them.
There is no coercion.”
The accusation that Jehovah’s Witnesses are extremists.
“Initially, certain publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses were declared extremist because experts claimed that these publications asserted that the religion of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the only true religion and all others are false.
Other denominations make similar claims, but in this case the accusations were made against Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The assertions that their religion is the only true one and all others are false were interpreted as propaganda of religious superiority.
“From my standpoint as a religious scholar, a weakness of [the court decision] is that a person, if so inclined, could find assertions by any religious denomination that its religion is the only true religion and that all others are false or have been misled.
“To say that believers consider their religion to be the absolute truth and to consider other religions to be either absolutely false or mostly false certainly describes any religious person.
It must be the case or one would be considered a hypocrite.
“However, to the extent that God’s laws do not conflict with secular laws, Jehovah’s Witnesses diligently and consistently strive to obey secular laws.
There is a reason why there are so many reports of Jehovah’s Witnesses returning lost wallets and paying fines or taxes that they could evade.
This is a conscious decision and I would not accuse them of any extremist pretense.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Bible.
“Something unique about Jehovah’s Witnesses is that they use various Bible translations for study and in the ministry.
They take great interest in distributing the Bible in different languages.
In this respect, they are uniquely Bible-centric.
Their Bible translation was actually declared extremist here . . .
Perhaps those behind that decision thought that Jehovah’s Witnesses were exclusively attached to that translation and that Jehovah’s Witnesses would give up if it was eliminated from the game.
That was a wrong assumption.
Jehovah’s Witnesses see the value in each translation of the Bible.”
The use of legal entities for practicing faith.
“The decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation shows that . . . the majority of congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses did not have a legal entity . . .
Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a certain area is automatically a member of a legal entity.
“As for the legal entities . . . , I carefully studied their charters, in which there is no mention of overseers, elders, pioneers; such terms are not found therein.
The charters usually refer to founders, a limited group of approximately ten persons.
When it comes to purely canonical activity, they represent not the legal, but the canonical aspect of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses. . . .
Their activity remains the same regardless of country or region.
“Jehovah’s Witnesses took note of the [Supreme Court decision that liquidated their legal entities only] by trying not to violate this Supreme Court decision outright.
At the same time, they continue their activity as a religious denomination that has not been banned by the authorities.
They continue their activity as private individuals who are practicing their religion.
From their perspective and from the standpoint of religious studies, their activity does not violate the Supreme Court decision.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses and blood transfusions.
“The Bible says that ‘life is in the blood’; therefore, blood should never be used.
The context is a dietary prohibition, but they interpret it more broadly.
They believe that blood should not be used in any form, not in food (they do not eat blood sausage) nor as a blood transfusion.
They do, however, accept minor blood fractions.
It is up to each believer . . .
By refusing a blood transfusion they are not choosing to die, instead, they want quality treatment and first-rate medical assistance.
Blood transfusions, in their view and from various medical standpoints, come with a risk because a person can contract AIDS or something else.
Bloodless surgeries provide a higher guarantee, and I see from examining the statistics that wealthy people often prefer to forgo blood transfusions because this guarantees better protection from infections and complications.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses and donations.
“A person can choose not to make any donations.
Theoretically speaking, one can actually attend meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses his whole life and never contribute a single ruble or dollar.
It is up to each individual whether to contribute or not.”
Although Dr. Ivanenko authoritatively testified that Jehovah’s Witnesses are conscientious, law-abiding Christians, the court ignored his arguments and sentenced all six brothers to various terms of imprisonment.
As Russia continues to accuse our brothers falsely and imprison them unjustly, it remains our prayer that Jehovah bless our courageous and faithful fellow worshippers with the joy of his approval.—Psalm 109:2-4, 28."
"On February 14, 2020, the Vilyuchinsk City Court convicted Brother Mikhail Popov and his wife, Sister Yelena Popova.
The court fined them 350,000 rubles ($5,508 U.S.) and 300,000 rubles ($4,722 U.S.), respectively, but did not sentence them to any prison time.
They will both appeal their convictions.
Mikhail and Yelena were arrested in July 2018.
Shortly afterward, they were released to await trial.
Since 2019, Russian courts have convicted 28 Jehovah’s Witnesses for their faith.
Ten of these brothers and sisters were convicted in just the last two months. However, these ten are not currently imprisoned."
"On Friday, August 30, 2019, Brother Valeriy Moskalenko delivered his concluding comments to the court.
The following is a partial transcript (translated from Russian) of his testimonial:
Your Honor and distinguished attendants, I am 52 years old and the past year I have been kept in custody.
To be exact, it has been over a year now.
In my final words at this court session, I want to tell you briefly about myself, how I view the criminal charges, and about my personal view of life.
I hope very much that you, Your Honor, will understand why I will not renounce my faith in God and why believing in God is not a crime.
I have not always been one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
My parents were kind and gave me a good upbringing, but even as a child it bothered me that there was so much injustice everywhere.
I thought, ‘This is not the way it should be—evil people and deceivers flourish, and honest and kind people suffer.’
At the age of 24, having seriously researched and studied the Bible for several months, I found answers to my questions.
Since then, I have been trying to make decisions that take into account God’s feelings, laws, and principles, which are described in detail
[in the Bible] and are exemplified in the lives of [worshippers] who lived in the past.
I live with my mother in the same flat.
She is elderly and needs my care.
On August 1, 2018, when my mother was home alone, the Federal Security Service (FSB) investigator instructed the Special Forces to saw through the hinges of our front door.
This is the way the investigator intended to enter my flat to conduct a search.
My mother was very frightened.
After the masked Special Forces broke into our flat, my mother had a heart attack and an ambulance had to be called.
Upon learning that the police were in my home, I arrived 30 minutes later.
When I saw my mother’s condition, my own blood pressure spiked.
Despite all this, I did not get angry and I tried to maintain my composure. I was kind—as befits a Christian.
My God, Jehovah, taught me that and I don’t want to displease him.
I’m sorry, your Honor, I usually don’t talk about myself this much.
It’s not my habit, but now I must do so.
I have been one of Jehovah’s Witnesses for over 25 years.
That is a large portion of my life.
And all this time I have never been considered an extremist.
On the contrary, I was known as a good neighbor, a conscientious worker, and a caring son.
Suddenly, since April 20, 2017, I have been called an extremist.
On what grounds?
What has changed?
Have I become worse? No.
Have I become violent or caused someone pain and suffering? No.
Have I lost the right to avail myself of Article 28 of the Russian Constitution?
Also no.
My name was not listed in the decision of the Supreme Court.
Nobody has deprived me of the right to use the Constitution of the Russian Federation, in particular Article 28.
Then why am I here at the defendant’s bench?
From my conversations with the investigator, it became even more evident that I was arrested and held in custody because I am a believer who uses the name of the Almighty God, Jehovah, in my prayers and speech.
But this is not a crime.
God himself has chosen his name and made sure that it was recorded in the Bible.
I repeat again and again, it is completely unthinkable for me to go against the will of God that is clearly expressed in the Bible.
And regardless of how I might be pressured or punished—even if I were sentenced to death—I declare that not even then would I abandon the almighty Creator of the universe, Jehovah God.
Your Honor, Jehovah’s Witnesses are known throughout the world as friendly and peace-loving people.
Their rights as believers are respected in the vast majority of countries around the world.
I would very much like the rights of believers to be respected in Russia as well and, in this instance, my rights as a believer.
I am not guilty of the crime of which I am accused and I ask the court to render a not guilty verdict!
Thank you!"
"A United Nations (UN) panel of international legal experts has concluded that Russia’s arrest and detention of Brother Dmitriy Mikhaylov was “discriminatory on the basis of religion” and thus violated international law.
They also urged Russia to drop all criminal charges against Brother Mikhaylov.
According to the 12-page opinion of the panel, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), Brother Mikhaylov’s actions “have always been entirely peaceful.”
Additionally, “there is no evidence that he or indeed the Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Russian Federation have ever been violent or incited others to violence.”
The WGAD concluded that Brother Mikhaylov “did nothing more than exercise his right to freedom of religion” and “should not have been arrested and held in pretrial detention.”
Therefore, he is entitled to compensation for his lost wages as well as for his personal loss of freedom while he was unlawfully detained.
The WGAD also recognized that Brother Mikhaylov is not alone in suffering injustice for his faith.
He is “only one of the now ever-growing number of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Russian Federation who have been arrested, detained, and charged with criminal activity on the basis of mere exercise of freedom of religion”—a right protected by international law.
Thus, in an effort to condemn the broader persecution of our fellow worshippers in Russia, the WGAD explicitly stated that their opinion applied not only to Brother Mikhaylov’s wrongful detention but to all Jehovah’s Witnesses who are “in situations similar to that of Mr. Mikhaylov.”
Brother Mikhaylov began studying the Bible as a teenager and was baptized in 1993, when he was 16 years old.
In 2003, he married Yelena, and they began serving Jehovah together.
In 2018, Brother and Sister Mikhaylov discovered that the authorities had been tapping their phones and had them under video surveillance for several months.
On April 19, 2018, the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation in the Ivanovo region opened a criminal case against Brother Mikhaylov and heavily armed officers came to search his home.
A little over a month later, he was arrested and detained, under the claim of financing “extremist” activity.
After spending nearly six months—171 days—in pretrial detention, he was released.
However, his travel and communication are restricted for as long as the authorities keep his criminal investigation open.
The Russian government has six months to respond to the WGAD’s opinion in which they must state whether the criminal case against Mikhaylov has been closed, whether compensation has been provided, and whether the violators of his rights have been investigated.
A similar WGAD opinion likely effected change in the case of Brother Teymur Akhmedov from Kazakhstan.
In 2017, he was arrested and subsequently sentenced to a five-year term for peacefully sharing his faith with others.
Having exhausted all domestic remedies, lawyers for Brother Akhmedov filed a complaint with the WGAD.
In their opinion dated October 2, 2017, the WGAD condemned the actions of the Kazakh authorities and called for Brother Akhmedov’s release.
Six months later, the president of Kazakhstan pardoned Brother Akhmedov.
He was released from custody on April 4, 2018.
Regardless of how Russia responds to the decision of the WGAD in Brother Mikhaylov’s case, our full trust is in the promise: “Happy is the man who takes refuge in [Jehovah].”
We pray that Jehovah continues to care for our brothers and sisters in Russia who face criminal action, so they will further experience how all who courageously trust in Him “will lack nothing good.”—Psalm 34:8, 10.
A UN panel of five international experts mandated to investigate cases of detention that are inconsistent with international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international documents.
In order to establish the facts, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) has the right to receive information from the authorities and nongovernmental organizations.
It also may meet with detainees and members of their families.
The WGAD presents its conclusions and recommendations to governments, as well as to the UN Human Rights Council.
Although the opinions of the WGAD are not enforceable, they are often publicized and can generate international attention, which may influence world leaders to adhere to international law."
"Andrzej Oniszczuk, a Polish citizen and one of our dear brothers, has been in pretrial detention in Russia since security forces arrested him on October 9, 2018.
His detention was recently extended for the fifth time.
His new term is scheduled to end on October 2, just days short of a year incarcerated.
Andrzej, prior to being arrested, with his wife, Anna.
She has not been allowed to visit him since his arrest ten months ago
Since being detained, Andrzej has been held in solitary confinement.
From 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., he is not permitted to lie down.
He is only allowed to take a shower with hot water once a week for 15 minutes.
Andrzej’s wife, Anna, has not been allowed to visit Andrzej for the ten months he has been in detention.
They can only communicate by mail.
She has submitted numerous requests to visit Andrzej, but each time she has been denied.
As previously reported, Andrzej was arrested after local police and masked special forces raided his home and 18 others in Kirov.
A criminal case was opened against Andrzej for singing Kingdom songs and studying religious literature.
Along with Andrzej, four other brothers from Kirov (44-year-old Maksim Khalturin, 66-year-old Vladimir Korobeynikov, 26-year-old Andrey Suvorkov, and 41-year-old Evgeniy Suvorkov) were arrested last year and placed in pretrial detention.
They have since been placed under house arrest.
Andrzej’s case, together with these four, is pending with the European Court of Human Rights.
This year, Russian authorities have opened criminal cases against seven more brothers from Kirov—the oldest is 70-year-old Yevgeniy Udintsev.
A total of 12 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kirov are now facing criminal charges for practicing their faith.
Regarding Andrzej, Anna, and the rest of our dear Russian brothers and sisters, may we never forget the inspired reminder: “Keep in mind those in prison, as though you were imprisoned with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body.”—Hebrews 13:3."
On the morning of June 7, 2018, 10 of the wives of the 17 imprisoned Witnesses in Russia sent an open letter to Mikhail Fedotov, adviser to President Putin and chairman of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights.
"On February 25, 2019, an application for urgent measures was filed with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on behalf of Brother Sergey Loginov, one of the seven brothers who was tortured by officials in the western Siberian city of Surgut.
The other six brothers who were tortured have been released, but Brother Loginov has been in pretrial detention since his arrest and does not have access to adequate medical care for his injuries.
On February 26, just a day after the application was filed, the ECHR responded with a favorable ruling.
The Court granted the request, ordering Russia to “immediately” have Brother Loginov examined by a team of independent doctors to determine the extent of the “physical and psychological” harm he suffered and whether his health allows for continued detention.
The Russian government has until March 11, 2019, to respond.
The ECHR grants such requests only in exceptional circumstances, when an individual is at risk of imminent and irreparable harm.
It is therefore encouraging to note that the ECHR took this step and so quickly—just a day after the application was filed.
The ECHR has indicated that it will closely monitor the abuse suffered by our brothers.
Currently, 19 Witnesses are facing criminal charges in Surgut, 3 of whom are being held in pretrial detention.
As we continue to supplicate Jehovah in behalf of our brothers, may we keep firmly in mind the reassuring words of Jeremiah: “Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah, whose confidence is in Jehovah.”—Jeremiah 17:7."
"On June 6, 2019, two weeks after Brother Dennis Christensen lost his appeal, Russian authorities transferred him from his pretrial detention cell in Oryol to prison—Penal Colony No. 3 in the city of Lgov.
Lgov is approximately 200 kilometers (124 mi) away from Dennis’ family and friends back home in Oryol.
When Dennis first arrived at the prison, he was subjected to insults and efforts to break his resolve.
Yet, Dennis has relied heavily on Jehovah and has shown himself to be strong and fearless.—1 Peter 5:10.
In Finland (left to right): Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body, Irina Christensen, and Tommi Kauko from Finland
Since Dennis’ arrest and detention, the brothers have offered loving support and care for his wife, Irina.
In June, Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body and other responsible brothers were able to meet with Irina in Finland for an encouraging visit.
Dennis has been in the penal colony now for over a month.
Irina was recently given permission to speak with him, once a day, over the telephone.
Approval has also been granted for her to visit him at the prison.
Irina rereading encouraging letters from Dennis
With all that Dennis and Irina have endured over the past two years since his arrest and imprisonment, they remain steadfast and joyful.
According to Irina, the weekly letters from Dennis have been especially uplifting.
In one of her favorite letters from him, Dennis wrote: “Staying positive is a key to success and we have so many reasons to be joyful.”
He concluded: “Upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty is the reason for our existence.
I know that our journey is a long one and we have not won the victory—not yet.
But we will eventually come off victorious.
Of that I am 100 percent certain.”
On July 21, at the international convention in Denmark, Brother Lett of the Governing Body read a message from Dennis.
Which said, in part: “I wish I could be gathered with you, but this is currently not possible since I have not yet completed my present assignment.
But it will be possible in the future, and I am looking forward to it.”
While under arrest in Rome, Paul wrote: “I thank my God always when I remember you in every supplication of mine for all of you.
I offer each supplication with joy, . . . I have you in my heart, you who are sharers with me in the undeserved kindness both in my prison bonds and in the defending and legally establishing of the good news.”—Philippians 1:3, 4, 7."
"Brother Arkadya Akopyan will have his final day in court on December 21, 2018.
The brother 70-year-old retired tailor is in the Russian Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.
He has been on trial in the Prohladniy District Court for over a year, defending himself against the accusation that he distributed “extremist” literature and ‘incited religious hatred’ during a Bible discourse at a Kingdom Hall.
It is uncertain whether the judge will issue a verdict on December 21.
However, if convicted, Brother Akopyan faces a heavy fine or up to four years in prison.
Brother Akopyan is one of over 100 other Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia facing criminal charges for their faith.
Consequently, we pray that all of our brothers and sisters who are standing firm in the faith continue to have the peace that only God can give.—Ephesians 6:11-14, 23."
"Early in the morning of April 10, 2018, investigators and special police forces, some wearing masks and carrying automatic weapons, raided and searched the homes of several Witnesses in Ufa, the capital city of Bashkortostan, Russia.
Brother Anatoliy (Tolya) Vilitkevich was arrested, and the authorities are holding him in pretrial detention.
Five sisters from Ufa, including Tolya’s wife, Alyona, recount how the raids have affected them.

"On July 2, 2019, a court in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, ruled to release Brother Andrey Stupnikov from house arrest.
Although he is no longer under house arrest, his criminal case remains open.
Brother Andrey Stupnikov
On July 3, 2018, the Stupnikovs were checking in for an early morning flight at the Krasnoyarsk International Airport.
Two Federal Security Service agents approached and arrested Brother Stupnikov.
He then spent eight months in pretrial detention before being moved to house arrest at the end of February 2019.
According to Brother Stupnikov, he has learned much about himself and his relationship with Jehovah over the past year.
He states: “[Olga and I] have been Witnesses for many years, but we have never had such a close relationship with Jehovah!
In the most difficult of times, I have felt, and continue to feel, the presence and support of our Father.
It amazes me just how close he has been to me and how quickly he has answered my prayers!”
Brother Stupnikov concludes: “More than ever before, I am convinced that my Father knows and understands my feelings.
This personal experience helps me to trust in him more fully and to not worry excessively about persecution.
It is much more frightening to lose this close relationship with Jehovah.
I am convinced that with him we can overcome anything.”
The growing list of criminal cases against our brothers and sisters in Russia has reached 217 as of July 1.
In a few instances, Russian authorities have reduced the restrictions on some of our brothers.
However, we do not put our trust in human courts or officials—our trust remains in Jehovah.
We pray that Jehovah continues to strengthen and shield all of our fellow worshippers in Russia.—Psalm 28:7."
"On Thursday, July 4, 2019, the Ordzhonikidzevskiy District Court in the Russian city of Perm’ announced the conviction of Brother Aleksandr Solovyev and fined him 300,000 rubles ($4,731 U.S.).
Brother Solovyev was arrested on the evening of May 22, 2018, at a railway station, as he was arriving home from a trip abroad with his wife, Anna.
Police officers handcuffed Brother Solovyev and took him to a temporary detention center.
Sister Solovyev was also taken away by the police but in a separate vehicle from her husband.
Officers searched their apartment all night—seizing photographs, electronic devices, and a collection of Bibles.
After some questioning, Sister Solovyev was released and not charged.
However, a criminal case was initiated against Brother Solovyev, and on May 24, he was placed under house arrest until November 19, 2018.
While awaiting trial, he has been required to comply with restrictions on his activities.
Attorneys for Brother Solovyev will appeal the conviction.
They have also filed an application with the United Nations Working Group Against Arbitrary Detention.
As persecution increases in places like Russia, we are “in no way being frightened” by our opponents.
We trust that Jehovah will continue to give all of us what we need to endure until his great day of salvation comes.—Philippians 1:28"
"During the month of October 2018, local and federal police raided more than 30 homes throughout western Russia.
Six brothers and two sisters were arrested and sentenced to pretrial detention for so-called extremist activity.
Consequently, there are now 25 brothers and sisters unjustly imprisoned, and 18 others are under house arrest.
October 7, Sychyovka, Smolensk Region—Local police and masked special forces searched four homes and arrested two sisters, 43-year-old Nataliya Sorokina and 41-year-old Mariya Troshina.
Two days after their arrest, the Leninsky District Court sentenced our sisters to pretrial detention through November 19, 2018.
Then, on November 16, 2018, the Leninsky District Court extended the sisters’ pretrial detention for an additional three months, that is, until February 19, 2019.
October 9, Kirov, Kirov Region—At least 19 homes were raided.
Five congregation elders were arrested and later sentenced to pretrial detention.
Four of the brothers (Maksim Khalturin, Vladimir Korobeynikov, Andrey Suvorkov, and Evgeniy Suvorkov) are Russian nationals, and one, Andrzej Oniszczuk, is a Polish citizen.
Brother Oniszczuk is the second foreigner, after Dennis Christensen from Denmark, to be unjustly detained in Russia for his Christian beliefs.
October 18, Dyurtyuli, Republic of Bashkortostan—Police raided at least 11 homes and seized money, bank cards, photographs, personal letters, computers, SIM cards, and cell phones.
Anton Lemeshev, an elder, was arrested and then sentenced to pretrial detention for two months.
On October 31, 2018, he was released from prison and transferred to house arrest, where he remains at present.
Despite the ongoing threat of raids and unlawful seizure of their belongings, local brothers and sisters continue to pray for those imprisoned and to provide them and their families with practical help when possible.
Until the situation is resolved, our international brotherhood will supplicate Jehovah in behalf of all his faithful servants in Russia, even mentioning some by name.—Ephesians 6:18."
"On Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at the Oryol Regional Court, the hearing began for Dennis Christensen to appeal the six-year prison sentence he received for practicing his faith.
Thus far, this court has continued the pattern set by other Russian courts, refusing to consider properly what the defense lawyers feel is overwhelming evidence that Dennis is innocent.
The three-judge panel may issue their decision on the appeal by the end of this week.
On the first day of the hearing, many brothers and sisters came to the courthouse to support Dennis.
Also in attendance were diplomats from various countries, journalists, and human rights advocates.
The hearing began in a small room that could only hold 20 to 25 people, so that about 50 more were denied access.
However, the court granted a motion by Dennis’ attorneys to move the hearing into a larger room that could hold close to 80 people.
The court adjourned after only three hours.
On the second day of the proceedings, the judges denied the defense’s request to re-examine a substantial amount of evidence of Dennis’ innocence.
This is unfortunate, because Dennis’ lawyers are convinced the evidence would reveal that the original conviction was unjustified.
At the end of the day, the court announced that the hearing will resume on Thursday, May 16, when closing arguments will begin.
We continue to pray that our brothers in Russia maintain their peace and firm faith in Jehovah’s promise that ultimately he will save them from those who treat them with contempt.—Psalm 12:5."
"Several international news outlets have reported that during recent searches in the Kirov region of Russia, authorities supposedly discovered “weapons” that they say belonged to Jehovah’s Witnesses.
However, the “weapons” that the authorities found were in the home of someone who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The “weapons” were actually three rusty, inoperable relics from World War II—two grenades and one landmine.
The individual’s wife, who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, apparently was not even aware that her husband possessed these items.
The owner of the relics was once a chief of one of the well-known Russian “Poisk,” or “Search,” squads that looked for the remains of soldiers killed in WWII in order to provide them a proper burial.
This work often yielded artifacts from the war, including defunct weapons.
As Russian authorities continue to fabricate lies to discredit our reputation as peace-loving people, we recall the words of Jesus, who foretold that opposers would “lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against” his disciples.—Matthew 5:11."
"Judge Ivan Belykh of the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Khabarovsk has scheduled the verdict in the criminal case against 52-year-old Brother Valeriy Moskalenko to be announced on September 2, 2019.
Brother Moskalenko has been in pretrial detention since his arrest on the morning of August 2, 2018, when Federal Security Service (FSB) and riot police raided his home.
Agents searched Brother Moskalenko’s home for some five hours before arresting him.
Because he has remained in pretrial detention for over a year, there is concern that he will be convicted and sentenced to prison just as was the case with Dennis Christensen.
On December 18, 2018, a complaint, Moskalenko v. Russia, was filed with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
Over 50 applications have been filed with the ECHR against Russia, with 34 of them already communicated to the Russian government.
We take pride in our dear Russian brothers and sisters ‘because of their endurance and faith in all their persecutions and the hardships that they are suffering.’
Clearly, they have Jehovah’s support and blessing.
We pray he continues to give Brother Moskalenko the strength needed to endure with joy, no matter the outcome of next week’s verdict.—2 Thessalonians 1:4."
"Brother Dennis Christensen has spent over 525 days in prison for practicing his faith and has appeared in court nearly 50 times.
The Zheleznodorozhniy District Court in Oryol, Russia, which is considering Dennis’ case, has scheduled hearings through mid-December.
Although his detention has dragged on for over 18 months, Dennis has never lost his positive attitude.
No doubt this is evidence that Jehovah is sustaining him in answer to millions of prayers by our worldwide brotherhood.
Dennis has received hundreds of cards and drawings from fellow Witnesses in Russia and other countries expressing their loving support.
At his October 30 court hearing, Dennis displayed through the glass of his detention booth some of the cards and pictures that children have sent to him, so that all who came to support him could enjoy seeing them.
During a break in his court hearing on October 30, 2018, Dennis Christensen displays through the glass of his detention booth some of the letters of encouragement he has received.
In addition to our worldwide brotherhood, the international community has shown great interest in Dennis’ case.
On July 21, 2017, the Moscow-based Memorial Human Rights Centre granted Dennis political prisoner status.
On June 20, 2018, Russia’s Human Rights Council requested that the Prosecutor General’s Office verify the lawfulness of the criminal prosecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
On September 26, 2018, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom formally adopted Dennis as a “religious prisoner of conscience.”
Russia guaranteed in open court that the ban on the legal entities of Jehovah’s Witnesses would not affect the rights of individual Witnesses to practice their faith.
Local and federal law enforcement agencies have disregarded this guarantee and misapplied the law to justify arresting Dennis and many others, charging them with “extremist” activity.
This year, Russia conducted scores of raids across the Federation.
As of this posting, 25 brothers and sisters are in prison, 18 are under house arrest, and more than 40 are under a variety of other restrictions.
The outcome of Dennis’ criminal trial will therefore set a precedent for the more than 90 other Jehovah’s Witnesses, in approximately 30 regions of Russia, who are awaiting the results of their criminal investigation.
We know our international family will keep praying that Jehovah continues to strengthen and encourage our dear brothers and sisters facing criminal charges for their faith, as we eagerly look forward to the day when he will “cause justice to be done” in their behalf.—Luke 18:7."
"On April 9, 2019, the Surgut City Court ordered the release of Brothers Yevgeniy Fedin and Sergey Loginov from pretrial detention.
This denied the request by Russian authorities to extend their detention.
Although the criminal charges against both brothers are still under investigation, they were allowed to leave the detention center on April 11.
Brothers Fedin and Loginov had been detained since February 15, 2019, when they were arrested following mass home raids in the city of Surgut.
On that occasion, authorities initiated criminal cases against a total of 19 Witnesses.
Three of them, Yevgeniy and Sergey, along with Brother Artur Severinchik, were ordered to remain in pretrial detention.
Artur was released earlier on March 15.
During the February raids, law enforcement officers tortured seven of our brothers, including Brother Loginov.
A complaint regarding this abusive treatment has been filed with the European Court of Human Rights.
The complaint is still under consideration.
We are confident that Jehovah will continue to demonstrate that he is paying close attention to our prayers as he strengthens our faithful brothers and sisters in Russia.—Psalm 10:17."
"On Thursday, November 14, 2019, the Ordzhonikidzevskiy District Court of Perm’ convicted Brother Aleksey Metsger and fined him 350,000 rubles (approx. $5,460 U.S.).
He is the 12th brother in Russia to be convicted this year for so-called extremist activity for peacefully practicing or sharing his beliefs.
Brother Metsger’s lawyer will appeal the conviction.
On April 25, 2019, a criminal case was brought against Brother Metsger based on the fact that he professed to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Some of the evidence included conversations Brother Metsger had about religion with individuals who secretly recorded their discussions.
The trial began on October 14, 2019, the city prosecutor requested that Brother Metsger be sentenced to three years in prison.
Although the court did not sentence Brother Metsger to prison, we are concerned that yet another brother has been convicted and that this trend will result in many more of our brothers and sisters being prosecuted for their faith.
While the authorities keep persecuting our brothers in Russia without just cause, we know that Jehovah will continue to comfort and strengthen them.—Psalm 119:76, 161."
"The Zheleznodorozhniy District Court in Khabarovsk will announce its verdict on Friday, February 14, 2020, in the trial involving Brother Yevgeniy Aksenov.
The prosecution has requested a three-year prison sentence.
On April 21, 2018, Brother Aksenov gathered with friends and acquaintances in a hotel conference room to discuss the Bible.
On that occasion, he spoke to those assembled about how Bible principles can strengthen families.
For this reason, he was accused of a “socially dangerous crime” and charged with “organizing the activities of an extremist organization.”
The trial began on October 21, 2019.
As Brother Aksenov’s trial comes to a close, we pray that he and his family will continue to look to Jehovah for support, confident in Jehovah’s inspired promise that his loyal ones will “lack nothing.”—Psalm 34:9."
"As previously reported, on May 23, 2019, the Oryol Regional Court upheld the conviction of Dennis Christensen.
As a result, Brother Christensen’s six-year sentence remains in place.
Since he has served two years in pretrial detention, which under Russian law is considered the equivalent of three years in prison, there are three years remaining on his sentence.
On the evening of June 6, 2019, Brother Christensen was transferred to a penal colony to begin his sentence.
An application regarding Brother Christensen’s criminal conviction will be filed with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
An application contesting his pretrial detention is already pending with the ECHR.
We admire the calm endurance of Brother Christensen in the face of this ongoing injustice.
We are assured that Jehovah will continue to sustain him, as well as the more than 200 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia facing criminal charges.—Psalm 27:1.
Read the transcript of Dennis Christensen’s address to the Oryol Regional Court on May 16, 2019.

"Authorities in Omsk, Russia, sentenced a Witness couple, Sergey and Anastasia Polyakov, to pretrial detention on July 6, 2018.
This marks the first time one of our sisters has been imprisoned in Russia since the Supreme Court decision banning the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The Moscow-based SOVA Center for Information and Analysis stated concerning this recent imprisonment:
“We believe that this decision, like the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses as a whole, had no legal basis, and we consider it as a manifestation of religious discrimination.”
There are now 21 brothers and 1 sister imprisoned for their faith in Russia.
We continue to pray that they have courage, knowing that Jehovah is their ultimate Helper.—Hebrews 13:6."
"On March 7, 2019, the Appeals Court in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, overturned the decision of the Surgut City Trial Court to detain Brother Artur Severinchik.
He was subsequently released from pretrial detention on March 15.
Brother Severinchik is one of three brothers who was placed in pretrial detention on February 17, following raids in the cities of Surgut and Lyantor.
The court has denied the release of the two other brothers, Yevgeniy Fedin and Sergey Loginov.
The situation has garnered international attention.
The European Court of Human Rights ordered an independent medical examination of Brother Loginov, who was subjected to physical abuse while he was detained.
We are grateful that Brother Severinchik was released.
We continue to pray that our imprisoned brothers in Russia trust in Jehovah, remembering that with his support they “will never be shaken.”—Psalm 16:8."
"Over the past 18 months, local police and Federal Security Service (FSB) agents in Russia have raided a total of 613 homes of our brothers and sisters.
Since January 2019, authorities have raided 332 homes—already exceeding the 281 that were invaded in all of 2018.
Authorities have been especially active against our brothers and sisters in recent months.
In June there were 71 raids, and in July there were 68—a significant increase compared to the 23.4 average number of raids per month in 2018.
Russian authorities raiding a home in Nizhniy Novgorod
In a typical raid, masked and heavily armed security forces converge on a house or apartment.
Once inside the home, agents have at times pointed guns in the faces of Witnesses, including children and the elderly, as if they are hardened and dangerous criminals.
It stands to reason, then, that several experts agree with Dr. Derek H. Davis.
The former director of Baylor University’s J.M. Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies, who states:
“Russia’s aggressive persecution of a peaceful group like the Jehovah’s Witnesses is patently ‘extreme.’”
Unfortunately, as the raids have increased, so have the criminal cases against our brothers.
There are now 244 brothers and sisters facing criminal charges in Russia and Crimea.
This number has more than doubled since December 2018, when there were 110 open criminal cases.
Of the 244 brothers and sisters facing prosecution, 39 are in detention, 27 are under house arrest, and over 100 are under a variety of restrictions.
Although our brothers and sisters continue to be targeted by Russian authorities, we are ‘not shaken by these tribulations.’
Rather, we are encouraged by reports that our fellow believers are remaining loyal and enduring.
We thus praise and thank Jehovah for answering our many prayers in their behalf, and we remain ever confident that he will continue to do so.—1 Thessalonians 3:3, 7."
"One of the 19 individuals being baptized
Our brothers hosted the first Romany-language regional convention in Slovakia, from July 20 to 21, 2019, at the Winter Stadium in Michalovce.
The abbreviated program had a peak attendance of 1,276. A total of 19 were baptized.
In attendance were brothers and sisters visiting from four lands: Belgium, Czech Republic, Great Britain, and Ukraine.
A highlight for the attendees was being able to enjoy the feature film, The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad, in their mother tongue.
The convention comes just five years after the first Romany congregation was formed in Slovakia in November 2014.
Currently, there are 9 Romany congregations, 10 groups, and 14 pregroups in the Czech-Slovak branch territory.
Peter Tirpak, the Winter Stadium manager, stated:
“The cooperation from Jehovah’s Witnesses has been excellent.
You have always kept your word.
We will be happy if you come again.”
Peter Varga, who served as the convention program overseer, said: “I’ve never experienced such a convention.
For our dear Romany-speaking brothers and sisters, this was a truly historic theocratic milestone.
After the final song, they began to hug each other, although they had never met each other before.
Many had tears in their eyes.”
We rejoice with the 1,010 publishers who speak Romany in Slovakia. These conventions highlight the genuine brotherly love among Jehovah’s people.—John 13:34, 35."
"On Friday, July 19, 2019, the opening day of the “Love Never Fails”! International Convention in Madrid, Spain, Jehovah’s Witnesses released the much-anticipated revised New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Spanish.
The revised Bible is now available on jw.org® to read and download by the over 2.5 million Spanish-speaking brothers and sisters worldwide.
People that speak the language are the largest language group among Jehovah’s Witnesses. *
Brother Gerrit Lösch, a member of the Governing Body, released the Bible in a prerecorded video presented at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, the site of the international convention.
The video was simultaneously streamed to 11 other venues throughout Spain.
Shortly after the release, the video was posted on JW Broadcasting®.
Attendees react to the release of the revised Spanish Bible
At the international convention venue, special arrangements were made so that attendees could download the Bible—as an EPUB, a JWPUB, or a PDF—by navigating to a webpage on jw.org.
Brothers and sisters tied in at the other 11 venues in Spain were also able to download electronic copies of the Bible by connecting their devices to JW Box, a customized Wi-Fi hot spot created by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Over 1,200 volunteers were on hand at the international convention venue and satellite locations to help the audience download the revised Bible.
Brothers and sisters download the revised New World Translation in Spanish onto their devices
The translation of the Bible into Spanish presented a unique challenge, since there is a diverse field of Spanish-speaking Witnesses throughout the world.
Brother Pedro Gil, a member of the Spain Branch Committee, explains: “Globally, there are an estimated 577 million Spanish speakers, and from country to country individual words, as well as expressions, vary in meaning.
Additionally, the Spanish language has changed significantly in recent decades.”
A young volunteer helps a sister download an electronic copy of the released Bible
In order to assist the translation team in producing an accurate and easy-to-read text, some 100 brothers and sisters in various countries were consulted.
The entire project took about four and a half years to complete.
Brother Gil states: “The updated language used in this revised Spanish New World Translation employs a vocabulary that everyone will understand.
As a result, publishers will find it easy to use in the field service or at the meetings.
We are very happy that this revision will also help Spanish-speaking brothers and sisters draw closer to Jehovah.”
We thank Jehovah for the recent translation that honors his name.
We trust that this revised Bible will help Jehovah’s Witnesses continue preaching “to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1:8.
^ par. 2 Because of the unprecedented volume of Bibles required for this release, no printed copies were distributed at the venues.
However, Spanish congregations worldwide will receive printed copies as soon as they are available.
The Spanish revised Bible will also be available in JW Library® after Monday, July 22."
"Dates: July 19-21, 2019
Location: Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain
Program Languages: English, Spanish, Spanish Sign Language
Peak Attendance: 52,516
Total Number Baptized: 434
Number of International Delegates: 6,300
Invited Branches: Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Central America, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Hungary, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru, Slovenia, Taiwan, Turkey, United States
Local Experience: César López, the resident director of one of the hotels that delegates stayed in, stated: “We have lived through an extraordinary experience.
One of the things our staff could not stop talking about was the type of delegates who attended this event—their smiles, their good behavior and their friendliness.
I think your message [“Love Never Fails”] is one that these delegates had already learned before coming here.
It was transmitted by everyone who stayed in our hotel.
We would love to have your delegates here again.”"
"Several rounds of heavy rain caused widespread destruction in eastern Spain during the months of September and October 2019.
The most serious of these occurred on October 23 in the province of Tarragona when the Francolí River turned into a raging flood.
Sadly, five people lost their lives in this flood.
Among these were two of our brothers who were crossing a bridge on the way home from a congregation meeting when their car was suddenly swept away.
The elders are comforting the local congregation as they mourn this tragedy.
A member of the Spain Branch Committee has visited the congregation to provide additional shepherding.
We pray that Jehovah continues to comfort our brothers and sisters during this trial.—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4."
"Since January 1, 2000, the Swedish government has offered state funding to faith-based organizations under the Support for Religious Communities Act.
Funding is only given to a religious group that “contributes to maintaining and strengthening the fundamental values upon which society is based” and “is stable and plays an active role in the community.”
Although Sweden approved State grants for most religions, beginning in 2007, it repeatedly refused to give funding to Jehovah’s Witnesses, criticizing our religious beliefs on political neutrality.
Having no other recourse, our brothers brought the Swedish government to court three separate times.
Each time, the Supreme Administrative Court declared that the government’s decision to deny our organization State grants was unlawful and should be reconsidered.
Finally, on October 24, 2019, the Swedish government reversed its decision and concluded that Jehovah’s Witnesses “fulfill all legal requirements” for State grants.
The same issue was recently raised in Norway, where the government has routinely provided State grants to all religions, including Jehovah’s Witnesses.
However, in recent months the government was asked to reevaluate the basis for providing State grants to Jehovah’s Witnesses because of our political neutrality.
In response, our brothers provided the Norwegian officials with accurate information concerning our views on political neutrality.
They also supplied the government with copies of the favorable rulings by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden, as well as favorable rulings in similar issues by courts and administrative bodies in Germany and Italy.
We are pleased that on November 18, 2019, the Norwegian officials ruled that Jehovah’s Witnesses should continue to receive State grants, concluding:
“Voting in elections is a fundamental right for Norwegian citizens, but not an obligation.
Abstaining from this right seems to be part of the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, . . . [but the government] cannot see that this . . . provides a legally sustainable basis for withdrawing state grants.”
Regarding these decisions, Brother Dag-Erik Kristoffersen, from the Scandinavia branch, states:
“We are happy that we are recognized as being a positive force in the community.
It is our hope that other countries that have similar arrangements take note of this ruling.”
Above all, we give thanks to Jehovah, the Supreme Lawgiver.—Isaiah 33:22."
"On September 26, 2018, the Supreme Court of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DPR) declared the religious association of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be “extremist,” effectively banning our activities.
Neither the general prosecutor, who initiated the claim against our legal entity, nor the Court consulted with any of Jehovah’s Witnesses during the proceedings.
The banning is the latest development in an escalating pattern of religious oppression against Jehovah’s Witnesses in the region.
The situation of our brothers in certain territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in eastern Ukraine, has deteriorated since the DPR Supreme Court declared some of our publications to be “extremist” in mid-2017.
During that year, police interrogated over 170 Witnesses.
Authorities in the regions have also systematically seized Kingdom Halls.
As of August 29, 2018, a total of 16 Kingdom Halls have been confiscated.
Despite these attacks on their worship, our brothers and sisters in these territories are continuing to rely on the ‘God of salvation.’—Psalm 18:46."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine welcomed thousands of their brothers and sisters for the special convention held in Lviv, Ukraine, on July 6-8, 2018.
Over 3,300 delegates from nine countries traveled to Ukraine, primarily to benefit from the spiritual program that featured the theme “Be Courageous”!
They also enjoyed the warm hospitality extended by their Ukrainian hosts.
Preparations for the convention began in April 2017, and over the next 15 months many local Witnesses volunteered to assist in arranging for the convention activities and to care for the brothers during their visit.
Delegates experienced some of the unique aspects of Ukrainian culture that included dance and musical performances, and a taste of traditional food.
Guided tours were arranged to visit a local museum, ancient castles, and to see a part of the spectacular Carpathian mountain range.
A special highlight was the opportunity to accompany local Ukrainian Witnesses in the field ministry.
The convention program originated from a large arena in Lviv, and the peak attendance was over 25,000.
Key portions of the program were broadcast to 15 other stadiums and numerous Kingdom Halls throughout the country, with a total attendance of over 125,000 and 1,420 baptized.
Ivan Riher, a representative at the branch office in Ukraine, commented: “We greatly anticipated this special event and the chance to welcome our brothers and sisters from other countries.
We enjoyed extending Ukrainian hospitality to our visitors and felt that the unity and courage among our global family of worshippers was strengthened.”—Psalm 133:1."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine hosted special Bible exhibitions to highlight the release of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Russian Sign Language (RSL), a major milestone in our translation efforts.
The exhibitions began on October 7, 2018, in Lviv and continued through June 7, 2019. Other host cities included Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.
Prior to each event, local sign-language congregations distributed both printed and video invitations to deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the areas where the exhibition would be hosted.
Additionally, the Public Information Desk at the Ukraine branch distributed invitations to educators, the media, and State officials.
Attendees at the first event, at the Lviv City Deaf Club, were shown the various digital tools available to the deaf for Bible study, such as the JW Library Sign Language® app.
Visitors also enjoyed a historical display showcasing the various formats used for Bibles over the centuries, from scrolls to modern-day books.
A notable feature of the exhibit was an edition of the Bible from 1927.
We are happy that the RSL New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures is now available.
We are confident that it will help those who use RSL to gain accurate knowledge of the Scriptures.—Matthew 5:3."
"The construction of the Britain branch office near Chelmsford, Essex, is projected to be completed in December 2019.
Already, it is recognized by secular experts as an example of land rejuvenation.
When our brothers purchased the property in 2015, it was a vehicle scrap heap and an unregulated dump site.
Volunteers unearthed and recycled large quantities of waste material, including thousands of tires—some dating back to World War II.
Then they sifted through the contaminated soil to remove even small pieces of debris, and recycled or repurposed the debris when possible, reusing the soil on the site.
Ultimately, more than 11,000 brothers and sisters have volunteered over four million hours to help restore the 34-hectare (approx. 85 a.) property.
Left: Trained volunteers clear the site of debris in 2015; Right: A recent image of the attractive botanical garden
The finished property will include native and botanical gardens, ponds, wildflower meadows, and an orchard.
The landscape design goes beyond aesthetics.
It also provides homes for native wildlife, manages surface water sustainably, preserves mature trees and hedgerows, increases native plant numbers, and beautifies the area for local residents.
Brother Paul Rogers, a member of the Construction Project Committee (CPC), says: “The property we purchased had been neglected and abused for many years.
The transformation of the site began with an army of willing volunteers painstakingly sorting through the waste.
The cleanup phase was followed by shaping and profiling the land in harmony with the existing natural features of the site, along with the planting of hundreds of new trees, bushes, and other plants.
The beautiful end result echoes the words of Ezekiel 36:35, 36: ‘And people will say: “The desolate land has become like the garden of Eden” . . .
And the nations . . . will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have built what was torn down, and I have planted what was desolate.’”
The cover story for the March 2019 edition of Construction Manager magazine, the highest circulated construction-based publication in the United Kingdom, focused on the Chelmsford construction project.
The article highlights the diversity and spirit of the volunteer workforce.
For example, the magazine notes that more young people and women contributed to the construction in comparison to a typical construction site.
“Everybody is happy here,” the article states, observing that overseers are greeted with waves, handshakes, and hugs.
