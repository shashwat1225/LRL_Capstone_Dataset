The clear phenomena that are in front of everybody's eyes are the cause of this trust.
No, the people trust the Islamic Republic.
One proof is the election that was held two years ago in which more than 80 percent of eligible voters took part.
Where in the world is there such a thing?
Another proof is the two rallies that we hold every year on the 22nd of Bahman [marking the victory of the Islamic Revolution] and on Quds Day. These demonstrations are related to the Islamic Republic.
They are not related to any particular administration or current: they belong to the Islamic Republic. Notice what the people do on these impressive occasions - in the cold weather of the 22nd of Bahman and in the month of Ramadan while they are fasting.
By Allah's favor, you will see again on Quds Day how impressive the people are.
This is indicative of the commitment of the people and their love for the Islamic Republic.
Public trust in the Islamic Republic cannot be better and clearer than this.
This presence is highly significant.
Besides, in certain cases such as the Dey 9th demonstrations of the year 1388, as soon as the people felt the movement that had been started was related to the Islamic Republic and the Revolution, not to a particular person or administration, they carried out that great movement.
It was not just enthusiastic youth who stepped into the arena. Everybody came.
The event that happened on the 9th of Dey was extraordinary and it was due to the commitment of the people to the Islamic Republic.
This is one of the most important strengths of the country.
The country has made progress under the most severe sanctions.
In what areas has the country made progress?
All of these areas are highly sophisticated fields in the world.
We have made progress in these areas.
This was while the doors of transferring knowledge to our country were closed on us on all sides.
I read an article which quoted an American newspaper, published two, three days ago.
The article said that Iran is an exception in nuclear technology.
China, Pakistan and India achieved nuclear technology with the help of other countries. But where did Iran get this technology? The article says that Iran did not get nuclear technology from a foreign country.
These are the things that our enemies are saying.
The article was published in The Washington Post.
We also made advances in building infrastructures - and you heard the statistics in this regard. There were advances in building roads, highways, dams, silos and factories and in producing important industrial products such as steel, cement and other such things.
Creation of different infrastructures in the country and technical and engineering capabilities in different industries - these are all advances.
Today our people, especially our youth, have more self-confidence than 10, 20 years ago.
He [one of the people who spoke in the meeting] was right and I know for a fact that in scientific areas our youth are prepared to anything for which we have the necessary infrastructure in the country.
That is to say, there is nothing that our young scientists cannot do, providing we have the necessary infrastructure in the country.
Thankfully this is our situation.
A wide range of construction projects have been carried out in the country. These are all advances.
We have had a lot of advances in these areas.
The fourth strength: international prestige.
I do not agree with the idea that today our international situation is bad. Not at all.
No, today our international situation is very good.
As far as foreign policy is concerned, today the Islamic Republic has come to be recognized as a respectable, influential and prestigious country in the world.
This international dignity - which is the result of certain factors, including presence of the people, public resistance and clear revolutionary slogans shouted by our people and government officials - cannot be undermined by the words and actions of a certain government in a corner of the world.
These actions have always been there.
Some people think that if a certain arrogant government in Europe and elsewhere says makes an insulting comment about the Islamic Republic, it means the position of the Islamic Republic has been undermined in the world.
No, they have done these things whenever they could. They used to do such things even when we used to back down against them.
It is wrong to think that it was our resistance and steadfastness that made them determined in their enmity.
One day one of the European governments used to express friendship and a tendency to establish relations with Iran. The same government formed a court after the Mykonos restaurant issue and leveled accusations against high-ranking officials of the country. European governments cooperated with it and all of them withdrew their ambassadors out of Tehran.
They received such a strong slap from this Hussayniyyah that a long time later they were still looking for a cure.
They tried to give us a slap whenever they could.
Whenever we backed down and treated them a little leniently, they got more insolent. No, the resistance of the Islamic Republic and commitment to the slogans and principles of the Revolution have increased our dignity in the world.
Thankfully today our international prestige is very good.
Conversely, the US government - the bulling enemy which has been openly opposed to us - is the most hated government in Islamic countries.
Of course if the people of European nations realize that their problems are caused by America and the hegemony of the Zionist regime over their policies, America's popularity will decline far more in Europe and all these actions will be mobilized against America.
And this is something that will happen in the not so distant future.
Another positive point is that there is stability in the country in spite of all these plots and machinations.
These are our strengths. Of course there are many other strong points as well: being inspirational, creating role models, undermining the power of the enemies on the international front and making the enemy despair of subduing the Revolution.
Our enemies have despaired of subduing the Islamic Republic in spite of the fact that their methods have grown more complex and their facilities have grown in number - in spite of the Internet, in spite of various kinds of organizations that exist in the world, in spite of the network that has dominated the world. The experiences that we have accumulated in legislation and executive work - these are also brilliant points about the country.
The population of the country is 75 million.
Of course I would like to take this opportunity to declare that considering the resources we have, I believe our country can accommodate 150 million people.
I believe in population growth.
If we fail to see the weak points and if we fail to identify our weaknesses, we will definitely be harmed.
We have had our own mistakes and weaknesses. We have failed to overcome some of the challenges we have faced.
Even in the case of the threats which are directly posed by the enemy, if are harmed, it is our own fault.
About the Battle of Uhud, the Holy Quran says, "When a misfortune befell you, and you had certainly afflicted (the unbelievers) with twice as much, you began to say: where did this come from?
Say: it is from yourselves. Surely Allah has power over all things."
[The Holy Quran, 3: 165] That bitter event took place in the Battle of Uhud: the Muslims gained an early victory, but then some people forgot their missions and left their posts to collect spoils.
And the enemy managed to besiege the forces of Islam and attack them. The enemy managed to kill a number of the Muslims and defeat the Muslim army, forcing the Muslims to seek refuse in the mountains.
The holy life of the Prophet (s.w.a.) was put in danger and he was harmed.
Then the Muslims asked why such a thing happened while God had promised them victory.
Allah the Exalted says that He kept His promise and gave the Muslims a victory but that it was the Muslims themselves who ruined everything.
God says the Muslims harmed the enemy just as the enemy harmed the Muslims: "And you had certainly afflicted (the unbelievers) with twice as much." God tells them not to be surprised. After all, in a battlefield you hurt the enemy and you also get hurt.
The Holy Quran says, "Say: it is from yourselves."
The Holy Quran says that it was the Muslims themselves. It was because of their mistake. We have made mistakes in certain cases and we have failed to fulfill our responsibilities in certain cases, otherwise "Allah has power over all things".
When people like you and I make our lives aristocratic and luxurious, the people will learn from us.
Some people believe that it is necessary to avoid extravagance in life.
Government officials must not turn to a life of luxury, at least as long as they are in a position of responsibility.
Disregarding the spirit of jihad and selflessness, disregarding the enemy's cultural invasion, disregarding the fact that the enemy is lying in ambush, disregarding the enemy's infiltration into the media atmosphere of the country, neglecting our duty to preserve what belongs to the people - these are our shortcomings and weak points.
The tendency towards tribal behaviors in political and economic arenas is among our other weaknesses.
Tribal behavior means that our criticism and approval of a person's action is not affected by the nature of his action, rather it is affected by our relationship with him: a mistake by somebody from our tribe is considered easy to ignore, but the same mistake by somebody from the opposing tribe is considered actionable.
If somebody from our tribe does a good thing, his action is considered praiseworthy, but this is not true of the same action by a person from another tribe: this is tribal behavior.
This behavior is not Islamic. It is not revolutionary.
I do not want to say it is prevalent, but it exists.
Many activities have been undertaken in the economic area, but the issue of employment has not been resolved yet. The issue of inflation has not been resolved. The issue of our culture of labor has not been resolved.
The culture of labor should be changed in the country so that people consider work as worship and increase the amount of work they do in a particular period of time.
It is necessary to work.
Patience, gratitude, dhikr, benevolence, fairness, lack of persecution, willingness to render services - these things should be promoted in our society on a daily basis.
We have shortcomings in these areas.
The spread of the culture of extravagance and luxurious lifestyles in society and the failure to stop the tendency towards violence among certain people, are harmful.
These things are harmful.
A few years ago I read in an American magazine that certain reform-minded people in America had suggested that the number of Hollywood movies which contain scenes of lust and violence should be gradually decreased and that movies about family values, innocence and noble behavior should be promoted.
They are thinking of reforming their situation, and yet we are learning what they are trying to reform.
One of the plots is to corrupt our young generation.
So far we have not been successful in confronting this plot.
Ideological principles should be presented in an appropriate way - both the principles that are related to Islam and the principles that are related to the Revolution and the Islamic Republic.
As I said, strong points increase our hope and they show us our capacities. And weak points show us the priorities and what we should do. Our time is up.
I think it is almost time for adhan.
Regarding the regional issues I would briefly say that the conditions of the region are developing in the opposite direction of the policies of western powers, America and international Zionism.
They imposed sanctions on Iran, but it was they themselves who were caught in an economic crisis.
They planned - or at least, strengthened - the fitna of the year 1388 in order to overthrow the Islamic Republic, but what happened was that the systems and governments which were dependent on them started to fall one after the other.
According to their own luminaries, they attacked Iraq and Afghanistan in order to besiege Iran, but it was they themselves who were besieged. They are trapped in a quagmire.
Allah the Exalted ordained that what happens should be the opposite of what they had planned and implemented against us.
As I pointed out, the recent events in the region are extraordinary.
Currently it is not really possible to calculate the dimensions of what is happening in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and some other countries.
Putting Hosni Mubarak in a cage and trying him in a court of law are a very significant event. It is not just a matter of replacing one power and government with another. The issue is far more profound than this.
Today the usurping Zionist regime has been besieged among countries that are motivated to confront it. The events are extraordinary.
But they have not been successful so far and thanks to the awakening of nations, they will not be successful in the future either - just as the Islamic slogans which were shouted in Egypt ruined their dreams again.
Of course I am concerned about Libya.
In Libya, the policy of the west is very cruel and cunning. They took advantage of the popular uprising. It is very important for them to create a foothold in Libya to remain there.
Fist, the issue of Libyan oil is important to them.
Third, they can have control over Egypt and Tunisia: two revolutionary countries.
Libya is bordered by Egypt on the east and by Tunisia on the west. Moreover, from Libya they can have control over Sudan, Algeria and all other countries of the region.
They want to create a firm foothold in Libya.
These things have to be built again.
I am concerned about the issue of Libya.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.
Make our life and death serve the cause of Islam.
Leader's Message on the Occasion of Pakistan Flood - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The flood disaster in Pakistan which has caused great suffering for our Muslim brothers and sisters in that country is reaching greater proportions every day.
This disaster has struck a widespread area, from north of Pakistan to the south, and it has displaced millions of people.
The large scale of this destructive tragedy has made it extremely difficult to provide aid.
The Muslim Pakistani nation is facing this great tragedy at a time when occupying and invading American forces are constantly using baseless pretexts to attack this Muslim country. Honorable Muslim nations,
The extent of losses is so great that millions of our Muslim brothers and sisters are in urgent need of food, clothes and shelter. A large part of Pakistan's infrastructures has been destroyed.
Unfortunately, international organizations have not properly fulfilled their duty to render services to the grief-stricken people of Pakistan.
Muslim brothers and sisters,
Whatever the amount of our aid, it is only a small drop compared to the large ocean of the needs of the flood-stricken people of Pakistan. However, in this critical situation, we should rush to the aid of our grief-stricken brothers and sisters on the basis of Islamic brotherhood.
An important point which Islamic governments and international organizations should consider is that they should help the Pakistani government develop and carry out plans to deal with this tragedy, provide aid to the people, and to help cope with the immediate and long-term consequences of this tragedy.
This is the case in as much as providing such large-scale relief operations is problematic for any country facing such an emergency situation.

Leader's Speech to Participants of 20th International Quran Competitions - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on July 5, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to participants of the 28th International Quran Competitions in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah and greetings be upon Muhammad and his immaculate household.
I am very happy that Allah the Exalted let me live one more year and gave me another opportunity to attend this pleasant and enjoyable Quranic recitation.
I enjoyed the way the dear brothers recited the Holy Quran.
I ask Allah the Exalted to associate all these dear people and all of us with the Holy Quran in the hereafter.
This is our wish. These international competitions show everybody that the Holy Quran is a unifying factor, the source of unity.
One of these factors, and perhaps the most important factor, is the Holy Quran.
All Muslim nations are humble before the Holy Quran. They want to learn lessons from the Holy Quran.
This is a very important opportunity.
The enemies of Islam and the Holy Quran have tried to create a rift among Muslim nations. They have tried to divide them.
This is the result of lack of attention to the Holy Quran.
Considering the fact that all Muslim nations accept this heavenly Book - this heavenly Message, this great divine gift - is there any other means of unity which is better than the Holy Quran?
All of us should benefit from this spiritual blessing. All of us should make use of this source of divine and Islamic dignity and power.
There are two things that we have ignored. One is the fact that the Holy Quran is the means of Muslim unity.
The second is faith in Quranic concepts and the promises that have been made in the Holy Quran.
We should have faith in divine promises. If we have faith in God's promises, then the path to dignity, unity and power will be opened up before the Islamic Ummah.
One example is the verses which were recited in this meeting by the honorable Egyptian qari: "If Allah assists you, then there is none that can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there then that can assist you after Him?"
[The Holy Quran, 3: 160] If God does not assist you, who will? These are brilliant verses.
Muslim nations should wave them as a flag and put them up in front of their eyes.
If Allah assists you, then there is none that can overcome you.
What should we do to make God assist us?
This is one issue.
What should we do to benefit from God's assistance?
The Holy Quran tells us how to do this. "O you who believe, if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and make firm your feet."
[The Holy Quran, 22: 40] If you help God and His religion and if you rise up for the sake of God, He will assist you.
We have practical experience in this regard.
Surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition.
[The Holy Quran, 13: 11] The Iranian nation tested this verse in action.
We made some change and Allah the Exalted changed our situation.
What is surprising is that if we take one step forward, God will take ten steps for us.
We changed ourselves a little and God helped us a lot and changed our situation.
Today we see the same thing in the world.
America did not want these things to happen in Egypt.
The evil Zionist front, which has influence over all western powers, did not want this to happen.
But it happened.
Why?
Because "If Allah assists you, then there is none that can overcome you."
If God helps, all material powers will be ineffective.
This is how nations should restore their dignity.
And to Allah belongs the might and to His Messenger and to the believers.
[The Holy Quran, 63: 8] Dignity belongs to God.
You exalt whoever You please and abase whoever You please. [The Holy Quran, 3: 26] He is the One who bestows dignity on people.
You should seek dignity from God.
It is necessary to become familiar with the Holy Quran.
It is necessary to have faith in the Holy Quran with all your heart. Superficial faith is not enough.
Today developing this faith is easier than it used to be.
Today there are so many divine signs that faith has become easier because one can see the same thing that Prophet Ibrahim saw. "That my heart may be at ease." [The Holy Quran, 2: 260] One can easily develop this confidence.
This is because the truth is in front of our eyes.
These things are right in front of our eyes.
This is the miracle of the Quranic call and the awareness that the Holy Quran has given us.
We should preserve these things.
Of course memorizing the Holy Quran is just a means.
The youth should utilize their talent and their memory. Encourage your children and youth to memorize the Holy Quran.
We have made a lot of progress, but this level of progress is not enough.
When the Holy Quran is memorized, there will be more of an opportunity to reflect on it, and this reflection is the key.
In any case I would like to welcome all those who have attended these competitions. I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow His blessings on all of you out of respect for the Holy Quran, and I hope He will associate us with the Holy Quran in this world and in the hereafter.
Leader's Message to 19th National Prayer Conference - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The creation of an entity called "mosque" - first in Quba and then in Medina - is among the most exquisite and meaningful innovations of Islam at the beginning of the formation of an Islamic community: The house of God and the house of people, the solitude of a close relationship with God and the companionship provided through socializing with people, the center for remembrance of God and spiritual ascension, the center for science, jihad and management of material affairs, the place for worshipping and a center for politics.
These are all interrelated pairs which portray the image of the Islamic mosque and illustrate the gap that exists between the Islamic mosque and worship centers of other religions.
In the Islamic mosque, the enthusiasm and joy of pure worship is mixed with the enthusiasm of a healthy, pure and rational life and brings society closer to its Islamic standard.
The mosque is the manifestation of the union of the world and the hereafter and the union of individuals and society in Islamic ideology.
Based on this view our hearts beat for mosques and are filled with enthusiasm and sense of responsibility.
Today we are not short of individuals - in our mosques - who can present a view of this glorious and impressive image.
The presence of our pure-hearted youth and conscious and sympathetic teachers and clergy has truly made mosques the center for remembrance of God, worshipping, thought and knowledge and has evoked beloved and precious memories in our hearts.
However, before this duty is fulfilled in a perfect manner, none of us can ignore the danger which threatens society, youth, families and future generations as a result of shortage of mosques or the shortcomings which exist in mosques. Nor can we deprive ourselves of the great blessings which Islamic mosques present to society and the Islamic Republic.
Construction of mosques and the presence of qualified clergy in them is the most important point.
Currently, despite the existence of thousands of mosques across the country, there is room for thousands more in villages, cities, satellite towns and residential complexes.
Easy access to mosques is an urgent need for our faithful people, youth and teenagers.
A pious, intellectual, expert and sympathetic cleric in a mosque is the spirit of the mosque - just as doctors and nurses are the spirit of a hospital.
Prayer leaders should prepare themselves to provide moral remedies and consider this an essential duty. And the centers in charge of dealing with the affairs of mosques and Islamic seminaries should provide aid to prayer leaders in all situations.
Mosques should be a place for teaching Quranic exegesis and hadith, a pulpit for promoting social and political principles and a center for preaching and promotion of ethics.
Through their kindness, the custodians, managers and trustees of mosques should attract the pure hearts of the youth and instill enthusiasm into them.
There should be well-defined and appropriate cooperation between mosques and educational centers in all areas.
It would be very appropriate if prayer leaders commended prominent students of every area in mosques and in front of the people.
Mosques should preserve a strong and continuing relationship with the youth who get married, with people who make scientific, social, artistic and sports achievements, with benevolent people who make efforts to provide aid to other people, with grief-stricken people who are in need of sympathy and even with newly-born infants.
Producing irritating sounds during night time and when people are resting is an inappropriate act which is at times against the laws of sharia.
The only sound which should be produced by mosques is the sound of adhan [call to prayer] recited in a pleasant voice.
And everybody should fulfill their duty in this regard as much as they can. The people, municipalities and government organizations should all play their role in this regard. Wise, responsible and pious clergy can and must act as the axis of this holy effort.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow success on everyone. I also pray to God to bestow a long life, continued enthusiasm and increasing success on Hojjatoleslam wal Muslemeen Aghaye Qara'ati who is a mujahid and devoted cleric.

Leader’s Speech to Students and Youth of Qom - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered in Qom by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on October 26, 2010 to a group of university students and youth of Qom.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all sentient beings, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Greetings be upon you Fatima Masoumeh, the daughter of Musa ibn Ja'far, and your immaculate, select and infallible ancestors.
Meeting with you dear youth in the last few days of the long trip is like a refreshing start.
One of the reasons why the general atmosphere of the country is full of determination, enthusiasm and rationality is that the youth make up a major portion of the population of our country.
And this meeting is truly a meeting for the youth. I have memories about the youth of Qom.
Although there are a number of youth among the students of Qom who come from other cities, the majority of the students who have attended this meeting are from Qom.
Before the political activities of the years 1341 and 1342 were in full swing, I had observed signs of vigilance and cleverness among the youth of Qom.
I will never forget that at the beginning of Haram Alley or on the other side of the street - Arg Alley - there was a newspaper stand. They used to put the newspapers there for the people to see.
When we were returning from school, we used to stop there and look at the headlines of the newspapers.
When the taghuti regime was forced to retreat in the case of the bill related to election regulations [the elimination of Islam from the list of preconditions required of the candidates and the vetting body] and decided to revoke it, the youth who lived around Haram Alley and Eram Street came to me and offered their congratulations on the success of the clergy against the taghuti regime.
The youth of Qom who appeared to be detached from political issues came to seminarians like me and offered their congratulations although we did not know each other at all. I wondered what kind of spirit made the youth of Qom so sensitive to the issue of political activities, the political movement and the fight between the clergy and the taghuti regime. There were no university students living in Qom at that time.
Afterwards, when the events of the year 1356 took place, Qom revealed its true capacities.
Qom started leading the public movement in the streets, presence in different arenas and resistance against the cruel iron fists of the regime.
The Ali ibn Abi Talib Army was one of the successful armies during the Sacred Defense Era, and it was a pioneer.
The people of Qom were successful in all great trials, and their youth were in the vanguard.
The people of Qom played a role in the Revolution.
They played a role in the Sacred Defense. After the war, especially after our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) passed away, the youth of Qom played even a more prominent role.
This is an important point. Pay attention to the fact that ever since the latter part of the first decade of the Revolution the enemies of the Revolution and the camp of the enemy formulated a policy with the help of Iranian experts.
Qom Seminary is geographically located in Qom, but its seminarians are essentially spread out in the entire country.
The seminarian who lives in Qom is influential in the city or village he comes from.
Seminarians have gathered here from different parts of the country.
When the members of Qom Seminary go on vacation or return home to do something, Qom Seminary is in fact spread out in the entire country.
Foreigners do not understand this. The Americans could not have inferred this truth. Only an insider - an Iranian, somebody who was familiar with the nature of the clergy - could have understood this truth.
They taught this to foreigners. Thus, they tried to prepare the ground for a fitna in Qom.
Because I do not want to mention names, I will just continue without mentioning any names. In the years 1358 and 1359, both the people of Qom and the people of Tabriz gave rise to an epic.
After the Imam (r.a.) passed away, the same event happened in another form in Qom.
If the people of Qom had not been vigilant, if the youth of Qom had been incapable of appropriate analysis, if they had not been clever enough, we would have faced far more problems than we currently do.
This is the truth.
People like me will be among you for a short time.
Our time and share of work is over.
It is you who should manage this country. You should help this national power and dignity - which has been obtained through different achievements - reach perfection. This is a duty in the history of our country that lies on your shoulders.
Therefore, you are the ones I am addressing.
If we accept that the camp of the enemy has prepared long-term plans for our country and our Revolution, then we must prepare long-term plans as well.
We cannot accept that the camp of the enemies of Islam and the Revolution - which has been seriously threatened by Islamic Awakening - lacks long-term plans. Nobody can believe this unless they are extremely naïve and unaware. The enemies definitely have long-term plans.
There are events that take place in the country from time to time in which foreigners clearly have a hand. These events do not just happen without anybody being involved. They happen as a result of their medium-term and long-term plans.
No, I showed some proof and evidence to some of the friends regarding the fitna of the year 1388 - they had prepared plans since at least 10-15 years earlier.
They had prepared plans since after the demise of the Imam (r.a.). The effect of those plans revealed itself in the year 1378, including the events that happened at the Tehran University dormitory and the other events that most of you remember.
Some people may not remember those events clearly.
The events that happened last year revived those plans.
Thankfully they were defeated, and they must have been defeated.
Therefore, the camp of the enemy has long-term plans.
They will not give up just because they were defeated on a certain occasion. No, they will design plans for the next 10 years, the next 20 years, the next 40 years.
You should be prepared.
Of course such meetings are not appropriate for proposing long-term plans.
I deem it necessary to briefly speak about the issue of acquiring insight. During the recent years I have spoken a lot about the issue of acquiring insight.
I would like to re-emphasize the issue of insight.
I emphasize insight in order to encourage you - as the ones who are in the arena and are responsible for taking action - to go after the measures and plans that are related to acquiring insight and fulfill this important need. Insight is a beacon of guidance.
Therefore, insight is a compass and a beacon of guidance.
Insight can provide you with light in a dark place.
It can show you the way.
Of course for ultimate success, insight is a necessary condition, but it is not sufficient.
There are other requirements for success. Hopefully, I will briefly speak about this in the end if there is time and my memory does not fail me.
However, insight is a necessary condition.
Even if all the other conditions are met, it will be very difficult to achieve success and reach your goal in the absence of insight.
In selecting a world view and developing an essential understanding of monotheistic concepts, one acquires a kind of insight through a monotheistic view of nature.
The difference between a monotheistic view and a materialistic view is that this world is considered systematic, orderly and purposeful from a monotheistic perspective. And we are part of this nature, and our existence and life are purposeful. We did not come to this world without a purpose.
This is the meaning of faith in the existence of the All-Powerful and All-Knowing God.
When we realize there is a purpose behind our existence, then we start to search for that purpose.
And after we realize what the purpose is, we start making efforts in order to achieve that purpose.
On the other hand, we know that from a monotheistic perspective any kind of goal-oriented effort will definitely help one achieve results.
From this perspective, despair, disappointment and frustration will be meaningless in one's life.
When you know that there is a purpose behind your existence, your creation, your life and your breathing, you go after that purpose and make efforts in order to achieve that purpose.
[The Holy Quran, 9: 52] Two of the best things are awaiting us. We will either be martyred on this path, which is the best, or we will remove the enemy from our path and achieve the goal, which is also the best.
Therefore, there is no loss on this path.
The materialistic view is the exact opposite of this. According to the materialistic view, there is no purpose behind the existence of man. A materialist has no idea why he came into being.
However, none of these are natural goals of life that accompany his existence. When there is no faith in God, ethics and justice become meaningless.
Nothing but pleasure and personal gains becomes meaningful. If a materialist faces a problem on the way to personal gains, he considers it a loss.
If he fails to achieve personal gains and if he cannot continue his efforts, then he become disappointed and hopeless and starts to think of suicide and other irrational things.
This is the difference between the monotheistic view and materialistic view, between divine knowledge and material knowledge. This is one of the most essential foundations of insight.
From a monotheistic point of view, when you engage in a fight, the fight is a holy struggle.
Basically, fighting is not based on suspicion or malevolence.
Rather, the purpose of this fight is to help humanity achieve goodness, perfection, welfare and growth.
From this perspective, life is beautiful, and moving on in this vast arena is enjoyable.
Your tiredness is relieved through remembrance of Allah the Exalted and keeping the goal in mind.
Insight is in fact the basis of all human efforts and struggles in society.
This is one level of insight.
One may suffer from lack of insight in different events.
It is necessary to gain insight.
What does gaining insight mean? In what ways can one gain insight? The kind of insight which is necessary in different events and which has been emphasized in Islamic narrations and in the statements of the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) means that one should reflect on the events that happen or will happen around one.
That is to say, one should evaluate issues in a reflective manner and gain insight out of this evaluation.
One should consider events in an appropriate manner. Appropriate evaluation and reflecting on the evaluation help create insight in human beings. That is to say, evaluation and reflection open one's eyes to the truth.
Elsewhere in Nahjul Balaghah, the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) says, "An insightful person is one who listens and then thinks, one who looks and then perceives." An insightful person is one who does not shut his ears to different voices, and when he has listened, he should think. One cannot accept or reject something just because one has listened to it.
An insightful person is one who listens and then thinks, one who looks and then perceives.
The problem with many of the people who slipped and fell into the pitfalls of lack of insight was that they did not look and they closed their eyes to a clear truth.
It is necessary to look first, and then one will be able to see.
Sometimes we are not even prepared to look at certain things.
We have seen some twisted people who are not even prepared to look.
I am not speaking about spiteful enemies. I will speak about these enemies later on: "And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them."
[The Holy Quran, 27: 14] There are some people who have ulterior motives and step in with their grudges. After all, an enemy is an enemy, and it is a different matter.
If we want to gain insight, we have to open up our eyes. We have to look.
There are certain things that can be seen.
If we pass over them in a superficial and careless way, if we fail to see them, we will naturally make mistakes.
I would like to provide an example from history.
In the Battle of Siffin, Muawiyah's army came very close to being defeated. His army was very close to being crushed.
The trick that they thought up to save themselves was that they put copies of the Holy Quran on spearheads and marched to the battlefield.
They said, "Let us do as the Quran says."
It was a good trick that had mass appeal.
A number of people in Imam Ali's army - who later on formed a group called Khawarij and drew their swords to fight the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) - started to think the enemy was making a good suggestion.
They thought, "What these people are saying is not bad. They are just saying that we should let the Quran be the judge."
You see, this was where they were deceived.
If they wanted to know the truth, it was right in front of their eyes.
How can such a person have faith in the Holy Quran?
We believe the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.), had been appointed by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), but even those who did not accept this agreed that the people had pledged allegiance to him after the third caliph and accepted his caliphate. He became the leader.
It was the duty of all Muslims to confront anybody who drew his sword to fight him.
If the person who put pages of the Holy Quran on spears really believed in the Book, the Holy Quran asks, "Why are you fighting Imam Ali (a.s.)?"
If he really believed in the Holy Quran, he should have put his hands up and said, "I am not fighting this war." He should have dropped his sword.
This lack of insight is the result of lack of care. It is the result of failing to watch out. It is the result of closing one's eyes to a clear truth.
During the events that resulted from the recent fitna, a number of people made a mistake, which was because of their lack of insight.
Claims were made that a great and impressive election had been rigged. There is an obvious way to settle this issue. If somebody believes that an electoral fraud has taken place, he should first present reasons.
He can complain legally. It is necessary to investigate and review the issue. Impartial individuals should investigate and see if there has been a fraud or not.
I helped them a lot. I personally extended the legal period for complaining. I even suggested that they themselves come and recount the votes in front of TV cameras.
[Audience shouting slogans] Please listen. My purpose is not to express my opinion about past events.
Therefore, acquiring insight is not something difficult.
If you see that there is a logical legal channel. But when somebody defies that logical legal channel and does something that harms the country and works against national interests, it is clear that he should be condemned from a fair, conventional and impartial perspective.
This is something obvious, an obvious judgment call.
It is not difficult to acquire insight.
Acquiring insight only requires that one avoid different pitfalls, including friendships, enmities, passions and prejudgments.
The demand to have insight is just limited to this level of reflection. It just requires a look, nothing more.
Thus, one can conclude that acquiring insight is something that anybody can do.
Of course some people are just careless sometimes, and their lack of insight is not rooted in spite or malevolence.
In spite of the fact that people really love their lives, sometimes they may doze off or fail to pay attention for a moment when driving, and a tragic event may happen as a result.
Such mistakes cannot be considered as sins. But if they keep happening, it is lack of insight and is no longer acceptable.
Today the main efforts of the enemy in its soft war are focused on creating confusion in the political atmosphere of the country. Pay attention to this point.
This is the most important thing that the enemy is doing today.
Those who know about political work and issues are aware that today the power of the superpowers is mainly based on the power of their propaganda rather than their atomic bombs and the wealth accumulated in their banks.
And they know methods of propaganda really well.
In all fairness, they have achieved good advances in propaganda work.
Today westerners - both in America and in Europe - have learnt modern and highly advanced methods of propaganda. We are behind in this regard.
One of the most essential things that they know is how to broadcast propaganda.
Through these methods of propaganda, through creation of uproar and through promoting a multitude of false ideas, they try to influence the atmosphere of different societies and transform them.
Today our youth have to shoulder a heavy duty in this regard.
Not only should you indentify the truth, but you should also promote insight in the environment in which you live and clarify things to the people around you.
One essential point is that falsity does not always appear in a bare form in front of your eyes, and it is not easy to identify it as falsity. Falsities often enter the arena disguised as truths or half-truths.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said that if the truth and falsity entered the arena in a bare form, there would be no disagreements.
If falsity had been pure and unmixed, it would not be hidden from those who are in search of it. And if the truth had been pure without a mixture of falsity, those who bear hatred towards it would have been silenced."
However what is done is that something is taken from here and something from there and the two are mixed, making the truth doubtful to those who seek it.
They mix up the truth with falsity and do not let falsity be bare and pure. Thus, they mislead their audience. It is necessary to be extremely vigilant in this regard.
In global propaganda, today all efforts are focused on complete distortion of the realities of your society and your Islamic government. And they have many propaganda facilities to do this.
Of course there are some people who - knowingly or unknowingly - repeat and reflect their statements inside the country.
There are other factors involved. One is the issue of lack of determination.
Some people know the realities, but they fail to make a decision and take action. They do not make up their mind to express what they know. They do not make up their mind to adopt the righteous position and defend the truth.
Sometimes just because one has made a certain comment, one may want to repeat the same thing persistently and may feel ashamed of taking back one's comment. "May Allah curse obstinate people." There are some people who know the truth, yet they contribute to the enemies' positions.
Many of the people who got cold feet and gave up used to be extremist revolutionaries one day. But you see now that they are standing for exactly the opposite of what they used to stand for and are serving the anti-revolutionaries.
And the main factor is failing to remember God, neglecting one's duties and ignoring death and the Day of Judgment.
Of course some people may make a mistake. It is not right to consider everybody a culprit. I saw some people giving them money as a gift, as a sign of respect.
The things that happen in the real world are similar to one another, but it is important to realize whether or not something is a bribe.
When you are in a position of power and can do something the way a person wants, that person may naturally come and kiss your hand or offer you money.
Well, this is called bribing, which is haraam.
They did not realize that they were involved in the kind of fitna about which the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said, "Through them Satan's emblems got flying and his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their hoofs, and treaded upon them with their feet." Fitna crushes and annihilates those who are in its way.
Somebody said something, and they repeated it.
Therefore, it is not right to hand out the same punishment to everybody.
The punishment of a warring enemy is different from the punishment of an unaware person.
Of course unaware people should be awakened.
What I want to tell you dear youth is that you should be vigilant, be present on the scene and base your actions on insight in order to be able to build Islamic Iran, fulfill your duties towards Islam and make your nation, your dear homeland and your history glorious. Today if somebody makes efforts for the glory of Islamic Iran, he has served his homeland, his nation, his history and dear Islam which is a source of salvation for humanity.
Take care not to suffer from lack of insight.
Try to identify the enemy.
Do not let the appearance of the enemy deceive you.
Materialism, materialistic tendencies, materialistic thought and materialistic civilization are your enemies and the enemies of humanity.
The western world achieved superior knowledge and technology two to three centuries ago, and it found a way to accumulate wealth. Different social schools were created.
Different philosophical and social thoughts came into being - liberalism which was based on humanistic thought, democracy and similar other things.
Yesterday I read in a newspaper that according to American sources the US carried out 80 coups in the world from 1940s to 1990s - that is to say, within fifty years.
You see the brutality of those who have achieved the peaks of wealth, technology, weapons, manufacture of military equipment and different other things.
Murder is something ordinary for them. They kill "in cold blood" - this phrase is in western literature.
This is a sign of complete cruelty.
This is the case not only in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places they have occupied, but also in their own country.
Go to their literature, which shows the realities of their life.
Their art and literature shows what is happening in their lives.
Murder is extremely easy for them.
On the other hand, in their communities and among their youth, one can see depression, disappointment with life and revolt against social norms.
These are what have been experienced by western systems and schools of thought. And these are all caused by the fact that they have drifted away from religion, spirituality and God.
Therefore, their behavior is the enemy of humanity.
Today you are moving in the opposite direction.
You want to achieve knowledge through divine thought. You want to make use of natural and human facilities in order to bring about material and spiritual benefits for your nation, other nations and humanity.
This movement will achieve success. It will continue. This movement is the opposite of the wrong and misguided two- or three-century-long movement started by the west.
This movement is an auspicious movement, and it will continue.
They should ask God for assistance. They should move forward with insight. Then they will gain the appropriate means to confront the wrong methods that are prevalent in the world, and by Allah's favor, they will achieve all the ideals and wishes delineated by Islam and the Revolution.
Leader's sermons at Eid ul-Fitr prayers - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the sermons delivered on July 18, 2015 by Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, at the Eid ul-Fitr prayers in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
Dear God, accept what the people of Iran have done with Your mercy and kindness.
Dear God, shower Your grace, mercy and infinite blessings on our people.
Dear God, bestow Your mercy and forgiveness on our dear martyrs, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and all those people who helped and supported the people on this path.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, I swear by the time, 0.527054 11.txt 2102-Leader-s-sermons-at-Eid-ul-Fitr-prayers.txt Lalle ne mutum yana a cikin hasara. Most surely man is in loss, 0.436436 11.txt 2102-Leader-s-sermons-at-Eid-ul-Fitr-prayers.txt Face wadanda suka yi imani, kuma suka aikata ayyukan kwarai, kuma suka yi wa juna wasiyya da bin gaskiya, kuma suka yi wa juna wasiyya da yin hakuri. Except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other truth, and enjoin on each other patience [The Holy Quran, 103].
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household.
And greetings be upon the Imams of Muslims and supporters of the oppressed, especially upon the Commander of the Faithful, the Mistress of all women, Hassan and Hussein - the children of mercy and the Imams of the guided - Ali ibn al-Hussein Zayn al-Abidin, Muhammad ibn Ali, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, Musa ibn Ja'far, Ali ibn Musa, Muhammad ibn Ali, Ali ibn Muhammad, Hassan ibn Ali and Hujjat al-Qaem al-Mahdi, Your representative among Your servants and trustworthy ones in Your land.
The first thing that I would like to say in the second sermon is to greet and congratulate all the brothers and sisters who say prayers and to advise them to observe piety.
The events that occurred in our region during the month of Ramadan and before that, were and still are bitter events.
Unfortunately, some vicious hands made the blessed month of Ramadan bitter for the regional peoples.
Many Muslim peoples in Yemen, Palestine and Syria experienced difficult days and fasts because of the evil plots of the enemies.
All these events are important to our people.
Another issue is a domestic one: the issue of the nuclear negotiations.
I deem it necessary to raise a few points in this regard.
The first point is a word of thanks to officials in charge of these long and arduous negotiations - the honorable President and particularly the negotiation team who really made great efforts and worked hard.
They will certainly be divinely rewarded whether the document that has been prepared will- through its determined legal procedures- be ratified or not.
Of course in order to ratify this document, there is a clear legal procedure that, by Allah's favor, has to be taken.
The next point is that by Allah's favor and grace, no one will be allowed to take advantage of this document in any way and to undermine the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic whether this document is ratified or not.
The defense capabilities and the security area of the country will- by God's grace- be protected although we know that the enemies have placed great emphasis on these areas.
The Islamic Republic will never give in to the enemy's greed in the area of protecting its defense capabilities and security- particularly in this environment filled with the enemies' threats.
The next point is that whether this document is ratified or not, we will not abandon our regional friends: the oppressed people of Palestine, the oppressed people of Yemen, the people and government of Syria, the people and government of Iraq, the oppressed people of Bahrain and the sincere mujahids of the Resistance in Lebanon and Palestine. These people will always enjoy our support.
The next point is that our policy towards the arrogant government of America will not change in any way despite these negotiations and the document that has been prepared.
As we have said many times, we have no negotiations with America on different global and regional issues. We have no bilateral negotiations with America. Sometimes, we have negotiated with them in exceptional cases such as the nuclear issue and we have done so because of our interests.
The nuclear issue was not the only case. There were other cases as well which I have referred to in my previous public speeches.
The American policies in the region are 180 degrees the opposite of the policies of the Islamic Republic.
The Americans accuse Hezbollah and the Lebanese Resistance - who are the most self-sacrificing forces in their country in the area of national defense - of terrorism.
This is while they support the terrorist child-killing government of Zionism.
How can one do business, negotiate and reach an agreement with such a policy?
There are other cases as well and I will expand on them in other speeches. American dreams
Another point is about the Americans' blustering in recent days.
Each of them is blustering in a different way.
Of course, this is alright with us. Their domestic problems force them into blustering. They claim that they have dragged Iran towards the negotiating table, that they have made Iran surrender, that they have obtained such and such concessions from our country and other such claims.
However, the truth is something else. They say that they have prevented Iran from building nuclear weapons, but this has nothing to do with our negotiations with America and other countries.
They themselves know this and sometimes they have spoken about the importance of the fatwa that bans nuclear weapons.
According to the commands of the Holy Quran and Islamic sharia, we consider building, keeping and using nuclear weapons as haraam and therefore, we will not do so.
This has nothing to do with them and with these negotiations.
They themselves know that this is the truth.
They know that what prevents the Islamic Republic from building nuclear weapons is not their threats and intimidating behavior. There is a religious barrier behind this and they know the significance of this fatwa, but they still claim that it was they who prevented Iran.
They are not honest with their own people and they do not tell them the truth.
On various other matters, they say that they have adopted such and such a measure about Iran's nuclear industry and that they have forced Iran to surrender, but they can only see Iran's surrender in their dreams.
From the beginning of the Revolution until today, five other U.S. presidents died or were lost in history dreaming that they would force the Islamic Republic to surrender.
You too will never achieve the dream of forcing the Islamic Republic to surrender.
There was one point in the statements that the American president made in recent days: he admitted to America's past mistakes.
He admitted that the Americans made a mistake in Iran on the 28th of Mordad. He admitted that the Americans made a mistake in helping Saddam Hussein.
He admitted to two, three mistakes, but he did not mention tens of others.
He did not speak about the 25-year oppressive and treacherous rule of the second Pahlavi monarch.
He did not speak about the many instances of torture, looting, massacre, disaster and calamity that were caused by America.
He did not speak about the destruction of the Iranian peoples' dignity and America's efforts to trample upon their domestic and foreign interests.
He did not speak about the Zionists' domination, the killing of Iranian passengers on a passenger plane and many other things.
Nonetheless, he mentioned a number of mistakes.
I would like to offer a friendly word of advice to these excellencies: today - after the passage of many years from the 28th of Mordad, the eight-year war and the defense that the Islamic Republic put up there - you acknowledge that you have made certain mistakes.
I would like to say to you that you are making a mistake in the present time as well.
In the present time too, you are busy making mistakes in different places in the region and particularly towards the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran.
In a few years, someone else will turn up and show you your mistakes, just as today you are admitting to the mistakes that your predecessors made.
You are making mistakes as well. Therefore, you should awaken, correct your mistakes and understand the truth.
You are making grave mistakes in the region.
What I want to say to the people of Iran is that by Allah's favor and grace, the Islamic Republic has become powerful and strong. It has become stronger on a daily basis.
It is 10, 12 years now that six great global powers - which are among powerful countries in the world in terms of economic wealth - have been sitting in front of Iran, trying to prevent it from pursuing its nuclear industry. They have said this openly.
Their real goal is to open the nuts and bolts of the nuclear industry.
They have said this to our officials many years ago.
The result of a 10, 12-year struggle with the Islamic Republic is that they have been forced to tolerate the operation of several thousand centrifuges in the country.
They have been forced to tolerate the continuation of this industry in our country.
They have been forced to tolerate the development of this industry and the continuation of research on it.
This is what they have been trying to prevent for many years, but today they have signed on paper that they have no problem with our nuclear industry.
Apart from the power of the Iranian people, what other meaning does this have?
God's mercy be upon the likes of Shahriari, Rezainejad, Ahmadi Roshan and Ali Muhammadi.
God's mercy be upon their families. God's mercy be upon a people who stand by their truthful claims and rights.
I would like to raise another point which is the last one.
Our predecessors used to call such statements, "boasting among strangers" [audience laughs].
I do not want to say anything more in this regard.
If those who will hear this statement want to know the truth and if they are willing to use their experiences correctly, they should know that should any war break out - of course we do not welcome and begin any war - he who will emerge humiliated [literally: "head-cracked"] out of it, will be transgressing and criminal America.

Leader’s Speech to Librarians and Library Officials - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on July 20, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Republic in a meeting with librarians in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Dear book-loving brothers and sisters, welcome. This meeting is a purely cultural meeting.
The main purpose for which I arranged this meeting with you dear brothers and sisters was to thank our librarians and library officials across the country for their efforts and for the great and important responsibility that they are shouldering.
The other purpose was to show respect for books and reading books and to underline the importance of books in society.
The more we move ahead, the more we will need books.
It is wrong to think that books will be sidelined after the emergence of new communication equipment.
One point is that if we are after increasing cooperation among our people in terms of thought, experience and artistic talent, we should increase our contact with books.
A book is a collection of intellectual and artistic products, a collection of the knowledge of one or several people.
We should truly appreciate the opportunity to use the intellectual products by different people and this is what books can give us.
Therefore, books are a valuable phenomenon and a precious entity.
This has always been the case and the future will be no different.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay serious attention to books, particularly to reading books.
This is the benefit of teaching literacy.
The effect of the movement that is carried out in different countries in order to root out illiteracy is to enable people to make use of the collection of other people's thoughts and artistic talents. This is not possible without reading books.
I believe one of the worst and most harmful kinds of laziness is the lack of energy to read books.
And if you do not do anything about this laziness, it will increase.
Reading books should be promoted in society and this is a duty that should be shouldered by all the organizations which are responsible in this regard, ranging from primary schools to mass media, the IRIB and public relations systems. There should be certain programs to make our children used to close and careful reading since early childhood.
One of the great and important things that could be done in society is to promote reading books and make it a prevalent reality.
We see today that owners of unimportant products, which have little effect on the lives of people, use various forms of advertisement to promote their products.
I would say I am not satisfied with the situation of our society in this regard.
Yes, today the number of books that are published is a lot more than the past.
They should buy books to read, not to decorate their bookshelves and show them off to different people.
Therefore, one point is the issue of reading books in society.
The issue related to libraries is another issue.
Since my youth, I have noticed the role of librarians whenever I went to libraries.
I used to go to the library at Imam Ridha's (a.s.) shrine and I used to see what important role the librarians played there.
One of the important things is that we should make our minds used to disciplined studying.
Sometimes referring to a book at the right time is far more effective than referring to the same book without having read related books. That is to say, if a book is read after similar books have been studied, the reading will be far more effective. Well, this requires guidance.
Certain people are used to reading books, but books that do not require thinking. Nothing is wrong with this.
After all, this is a kind of reading. I would not deny this. But it is better to combine recreational reading - like reading novels, autobiographies and easy historical books - with reading serious books, books that require thinking and careful studying.
One of the things that we need today is a list of books for people from different social backgrounds.
Often when I encourage our youth to read books, they come to me and ask which books they should read.
There is no fixed answer to this question. Probably there are many different answers.
Those who are responsible - both in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance and in our libraries - should work seriously on this issue. In different areas and for people from various social backgrounds, they should recommend a series of books with acceptable variety.
They should tell people which books to read before others. When a youth or somebody who is not used to reading books is encouraged to start studying and to move ahead, he or she will often find a way that is appropriate for him or her.
This is another point.
A book is the outcome of the thought, experience or art of the people who have prepared and produced that book.
Not every book is beneficial. Not every book is harmless.
Certain books are harmful.
Just as health officials warn people and do not allow poisonous drugs, dangerous drugs and habit-forming drugs to be available to everybody, so those who are responsible for the affairs related to books should not argue that people are free to choose which book to read and let every harmful book be read. Books are spiritual food. If they are corrupt, poisoned and harmful, publishers, librarians, library officials, those in charge of distribution and others do not have the right to make them available to unsuspecting people.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful.
It is necessary to make good and wholesome books available.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point besides providing a list of books to read.
As Iranians and a Muslim nation, we have had a fundamental, deep and long-lasting relationship with books.
Big libraries, scholarly communities and valuable writings have a long history in our country, especially after the spread of Islam.
We have a long historical background as far as books are concerned. We have been familiar with books for many centuries.
Of course those days it was not easy to have access to books.
Copying books was difficult, but people who loved and needed books made a lot of efforts in this regard.
We have read or heard many stories about people who owned a particular book and were not prepared to lend it to other people. The people who needed the book had to beg the owner to lend it to them for a couple of days and then they had to stay up day and night to hand-copy the book without resting so that they could have a copy of the book.
There are many such stories.
Today these obstacles have been removed.
Today we should take this long historical background into consideration and try to improve our position in publishing and reading books.
Those who produce books should also pay attention to this point. When producing books - in the sense of producing copies of books, translating them or making them available to people - it is necessary to pay attention to the needs and shortcomings in society.
We see that they sometimes provide misleading advice in the book market. In particular, they go after issues that are harmful to the country's mentality in moral, religious, ideological or political matters. One can clearly see that there are certain hands in the book market that try to promote certain ideas and have certain things translated with ulterior political motives.
I would say that as far as cultural matters are concerned many of the activities that are promoted in our country by foreigners and by the enemies of Islam and the Islamic Republic appear to be cultural, but they are political in nature. One can see these things.
Those who are in charge of the affairs related to books - including librarians, library managers, officials working for the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance and publishers - should pay attention to the point that they should promote healthy, beneficial and nutritious spiritual nourishment in society.
Fortunately literacy has been widely promoted in our society and it is possible for people to make use of books. We should make use of this opportunity.
I would like to take this opportunity to ask our government officials to review the matters related to books, reading books and good and beneficial books. I would like to ask them to start a movement in the country. A new perspective should be adopted by those who make plans, those who produce books, those who are in charge of advertisement and those who read books - including our youth and others.
Printing 1000-3000 copies is not good for a country with 75 million people and with so many highly motivated youth. We should be able to print a lot more copies. Fortunately certain books are published many times, but in general the situation is not satisfactory.
In any case I would like to thank the officials in charge of the affairs related to books.
This average amount of time should be far more than this. The need for books will never be eliminated. People need books from early adolescence and from early years of learning literacy to the end of their life.
I am grateful to you for your efforts.
I am happy about what has been done so far and I expect you to intensify your efforts.
By Allah's favor, you will benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei on February 21, 2011 in a meeting with a group of government officials.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to congratulate you dear audience, the entire Iranian nation, the great Islamic Ummah and all the people who fight for freedom and justice throughout the world on the auspicious birthday anniversaries of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), Muhammad ibn Abdullah, and his honorable descendant, Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq (a.s.).
The birth of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was the beginning of a brilliant dawn in the life of humanity.
His birth made the people of his time see the divine warnings with their own eyes. The castles of oppressive kings collapsed.
The birth of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was a prelude to his be'that [being appointed as prophet].
The advances made by humanity, the scientific advances, the different areas of knowledge and the great discoveries that have been made in the world are all because of the emergence of the light of Islam in that amazing historical era.
And this blessing was made available to people.
If humanity had more knowledge, if humanity enjoyed a deeper understanding, if humanity knew the Prophet (s.w.a.), if humanity was familiar with Islam, if humanity knew the message of Islam, today the scene of history would be a different scene. The ignorance of human beings and their short-sightedness have made them fall behind.
And today we can see the signs.
Today the world is frustrated at the heavy impositions of materialistic civilization, and it is looking for a way out.
Today the wave of Islamic Awakening that you see in certain Islamic countries, such as Egypt and Tunisia, is a sign that humanity is frustrated.
When demons dominate the life of people - human demons are more dangerous than jinn demons - and when the arrogant powers of the world mislead the people of the world by interfering in the personal life of people, their economy, their understanding and their ideologies, life enters a dark void. This darkness goes against the nature of human beings, and it awakens the human nature of people.
This is what is happening in the world.
The western world, which is enslaved by the hegemony of material power, is frustrated today.
If we Muslims could present Islam appropriately and if we could adjust our behavior according to Islam, the entire world would definitely turn to Islam. The problem is with us.
We are the first people addressed by the Holy Quran and the message of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
We should reform ourselves.
We should improve ourselves. Thanks to Islam, nations have awakened today.
The first effect of this awakening is the expression of hatred toward the presence of the arrogant powers in the region.
The Americans are trying to keep away from the great popular movement which can be seen today in certain Islamic countries. But this is not possible.
It is the hegemony of the arrogant powers that has humiliated the nations of the region.
It is the machinations and interference of the arrogant powers in the region that have prevented Muslim nations from extending a hand of brotherhood towards each other, from understanding each other, from pooling their resources, from establishing a genuine Islamic Ummah. It is necessary to put an end to this state of affairs.
Nations should get rid of the interference and hegemony of the arrogant powers.
This is the key to resolving the problems of the region.
The problems of the regional peoples and movements - governments which have moved away from their people - are due to the presence of the arrogant powers, especially America, in the region.
The solution to the problems of the region is that the peoples and governments should wake up to the reality and prevent the great Satan from dominating and interfering in the destiny of their nations.
America's Middle Eastern policies have turned the peoples of the region against their governments. These policies have created a chasm between the peoples and governments of the region. If the people of a country join their government, no foreign power will be able to dominate that country.
What we see today in certain Islamic countries is the presence of the people on the scene.
When the people are present on the scene, the sword of the superpowers becomes blunt.
Then the superpowers cannot bully the people. The superpowers help their friends and mercenaries dominate the people - bully the people. When the people step into the arena, their governments receive support, providing that their governments join their people.
This is the solution to the problems of this region.
Today the fake Zionist regime is like a cancerous tumor in the region, a tumor that has plagued the region.
The arrogant powers have focused all their efforts on safeguarding this cancerous tumor in the region.
The existence of this cancerous tumor in the region has caused war, discord and wrong policies in the region.
They are doing everything in their power in order to safeguard this tumor and preserve their stronghold in the region. Today we are witness to the signs and consequences of these efforts: the reaction of the peoples of the region. When the people awaken, they do not tolerate such conditions.
I believe that the movements which we see today in certain Islamic countries are the reaction of the peoples to the long-standing humiliation that the arrogant powers have imposed on them.
Today they have found an opportunity, and they have stepped into the arena.
Religious scholars and political, scientific and academic figures have a very heavy responsibility to shoulder.
Today the people of these countries are in need of the guidance of these prominent figures - political figures, scientific figures, academic figures, religious figures.
They have a heavy responsibility.
They must not let the system of arrogance use the different tools they enjoy and hijack this great popular movement.
They must be vigilant.
They should guide people towards the goals and ideals which are lofty for all countries.
If this happens, the region will have a bright future - the future of the Islamic Ummah will be bright.
In terms of our strategic position and our natural resources, we Muslims enjoy a very sensitive position in the world.
But it is others who are ruling us. It is others who determine our destiny. They make decisions about our oil and our governments.
This state of affairs must be transformed, and there is no doubt that it will be so.
Islam tells its followers: "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves. You will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from Allah and pleasure.
Their marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration." [The Holy Quran, 48: 29] These are the characteristics of the Islamic Ummah.
Reliance on God, remembrance of God, engaging in dhikr, humility before God - these are the signs of the spirituality that members of the Islamic Ummah enjoy.
0.273482
[The Holy Quran, 48: 29] These are the developmental stages of the Islamic Ummah.
It is the hand of divine power that helps human beings grow like this.
That He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them.
We should reform ourselves.
We should adjust our life according to the Holy Quran.
We should adjust our behavior towards friends, enemies and arrogant powers according to the Quranic plan.
Allah the Exalted has promised that He will reward those who act like this, and this reward will be offered both in this world and in the hereafter.
And paradise is the reward in the hereafter.
This is the path that you dear people of Iran are treading. By Allah's favor, you will continue treading this path.
Fortunately we see that today Muslim nations from different parts of the world of Islam are gradually moving towards this path.
Allah the Exalted says: "And the end is for the God-fearing." [The Holy Quran, 7: 128] If we practice fear of God as a principle in our actions, there is no doubt that ultimate victory will belong to the Islamic Ummah.
I hope Allah the Exalted will enable all Muslim nations and the Islamic Ummah - particularly the elites and influential figures of the Islamic Ummah - to benefit most from the teachings of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the Holy Quran.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow His bountiful blessings on our magnanimous Imam who opened up this path in front of us and on our dear martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this path.
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution issued a message praising the Iranian nation for their massive presence in the Bahman 22nd rallies.
The following is an excerpt of the message:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I wholeheartedly thank God who manifested His hand of power through your faith, determination, and insight and proved the power and dynamism of the Islamic Republic - which is rooted in the faith and confidence of this ancient nation - to its enemies more than ever before on the 31st anniversary of the Revolution.
Is thirty years of trial and error not enough to awaken the arrogant and bullying powers and prove to them the futility of their efforts to dominate Islamic Iran?
Is the presence of millions of enthusiastic and insightful people in the ceremonies marking the 31st anniversary of the Revolution not enough to awaken the ill-wishers and deceived people inside the country who sometimes hypocritically claim to support the people? Is this not enough to show them the wish and path of the nation which is the path of pure Islam and our magnanimous Imam?
The friends and enemies of the Iranian nation should know that this nation has found its path and will remove all obstacles on its way to reach the peaks of success and prosperity by relying on God and their God-given power.
May God bestow His assistance and success on this nation, and I hope this nation will benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for him).
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Leader’s Norouz Message - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the message issued on March 20, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on the occasion of Norouz.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
O Conqueror of hearts and sight, O Planner of night and day,
Dear God, Your greetings be upon Your beloved, the mistress of all women in the world, Fatima bint Muhammad, Allah's greetings be upon him and his household.
Dear God, Your blessings be upon her, her father, her husband and her children.
Dear God, bestow on him, on his descendents, on his followers, on his people, on his special ones, on all those who obey him, on his enemies and on all people of the world what You brighten up his eyes with and what You make his heart happy with.
I would like to offer my congratulations to all my esteemed fellow countrymen throughout Iran, to all Iranians who are in different parts of the world and to all nations that celebrate Norouz, particularly our honorable war veterans, the families of our martyrs, our disabled war veterans and their families and all those who are making efforts to serve the Islamic system and our dear country.
I hope that Allah the Exalted makes this day and this new year's day a source of happiness, prosperity and joy for our nation and for all Muslims in the world. I hope that Allah the Exalted makes us successful in carrying out our responsibilities.
My honorable fellow countrymen should pay attention that the days for commemorating the martyrdom of Hazrat Fatima are in the middle of the Norouz holidays and it is necessary for all of us to value and respect these days.
The moment a new year starts is in fact the interval between an end and a beginning: the end of one year and the beginning of a new year.
Of course, we should mainly focus on what lies ahead.
We should look at the new year and we should make plans and prepare ourselves for it.
However, looking back on the path that we have followed will also be beneficial for us so that we see what we have done, how we have moved forward and what results our work has produced, and we should learn lessons from it and gain experience.
Life is full of twists and turns, full of ups and downs. What is important is that we should climb out of the depths and try to reach the peaks.
As far as our confrontation with the arrogant powers of the world is concerned, what was obvious about the year 1391 was the harshness of the enemies towards the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic.
Of course, on the surface of the issue, the enemies were harsh, but below the surface was the experience of the Iranian nation and its victory in different arenas.
Our enemies had targeted different areas, mainly economic and political.
On the economic front, they announced and reiterated that they wanted to cripple the Iranian nation through sanctions.
However, they failed to cripple the Iranian nation and by Allah's favor and grace, we achieved a lot of progress in different areas, which has been or will be explained to our dear people in detail. And God willing, I will also briefly discuss certain things in my speech on the first day of Farvardin.
In particular, there were certain flaws inside the country. There were certain cases of negligence and laxity which aided the enemy in his plans. But on the whole, the general movement of the Islamic system and the people was a progressive movement and by Allah's favor, we will see the outcomes of this national experience in the future.
On the political front, on the one hand they tried to isolate the Iranian nation and on the other hand they tried to throw the Iranian nation into indecision and uncertainty.
What happened in reality was the exact opposite. Regarding their efforts to isolate the Iranian nation, not only did they fail to restrain our rational international policies, but also events such as the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement were held in Tehran and a large number of leaders and government officials from different countries throughout the world attended the summit.
This led to the opposite of what our enemies wanted and showed that not only is the Islamic Republic not isolated but that people of the world hold the Islamic Republic, Islamic Iran and the honorable Iranian nation in high regard.
Regarding domestic issues, whenever our dear people had the opportunity to express their feelings - mainly on the 22nd of Bahman of 1391 - they exhibited whatever enthusiasm and epic presence that was necessary and they were present on the scene in larger numbers and with more enthusiasm than the previous years.
Another example was the presence of the people of North Khorasan in the thick of the sanctions, which was an example that showed the conditions and spirits of the Iranian people and their attitude towards the Islamic system and the officials who are serving them.
Thankfully, great things were done throughout the year, including scientific endeavors, the work relating to infrastructure and the strenuous efforts by the people and government officials.
The ground has been prepared for progressive movement and for - God willing - explosive progress, in economic and political areas as well as in other crucial areas.
According to the outlook that has been delineated for us by Allah's favor and thanks to the determination our faithful people, the year 1392 will be the year of progress, dynamism and experience for the Iranian nation, not in the sense that the enmity of the enemies will decrease, rather in the sense that the Iranian people will be more prepared and their presence will be more effective.
Of course, what lies ahead for us in the year 1392 will be in the two important areas of politics and economics.
On the economic front, it is necessary to pay attention to domestic production, just as had been stressed in last year's slogan.
Of course, certain things were done, but promoting domestic production and supporting Iranian labor and capital is a long-term issue: it cannot reach the desired outcome in one year.
Fortunately, in the second half of the year 1391, the policies for domestic production were ratified and announced for implementation. That is to say, the ground work was laid for this work. And on the basis of these policies, the Majlis and the executive branch can make plans, start a good movement and hopefully move forward with firm determination and continued efforts.
Regarding political issues, the great event of the year 1392 is the presidential elections, which will in fact determine the executive and political destiny of the country - and in a sense, the general destiny of the country - for the next four years.
God willing, the people will manage to build a good future for themselves and their country through their presence in this arena.
Of course, it is necessary for the people to have a jihad-like presence both in the economic arena and in the political arena.
It is necessary to step into the arenas with a heart full of hope and enthusiasm and to try to reach the goals with epic moves.
With this outlook, I name the year 1392 "The Year of Political and Economic Valor" and I hope that by Allah's grace, our dear people and our caring government officials will give rise to an economic as well as a political epic.
With the hope of receiving divine attentions and benefiting from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake), and saluting the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam and the souls of our honorable martyrs,
Leader’s Speech to Foreign Seminarians in Qom - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei on October 25, 2010 to foreign seminarians in Qom.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Greetings be upon you Fatima Masoumeh, the daughter of Musa ibn Ja'far, and your immaculate, chosen and infallible ancestors.
You dear foreign seminarians and scholars should know that you are not strangers in Islamic Iran.
You are my dear children.
We appreciate the presence of the eager instructors and seminarians who have traveled to our country with the enthusiasm to learn pure Islamic teachings.
We consider it our responsibility to help you dear people as much as we can to benefit from pure Islamic teachings and the teachings of Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
The first lesson that the Islamic Revolution and the auspicious Islamic Republic taught us was that we should think beyond our borders and turn our attention to the vast arena of the Islamic Ummah.
Our magnanimous Imam taught us that our attention should be focused on the great Islamic Ummah.
Iran was extremely frustrated under the pressure of tyranny and colonialism during the rule of taghut. It was being crushed by the pressure, and it needed to be saved.
For several centuries, the great Islamic Ummah, which has been in one of the most strategic locations in the world, was suffering from weakness, defeat, backwardness, colonialism and material and scientific poverty due to the interference of superpowers, greed of powerful governments and belligerence of the arrogant powers. The attention of the Islamic Revolution was focused on the world of Islam. Its attention was focused on helping the Islamic Ummah get rid of the arrogant powers' hand of oppression and aggression.
Therefore, when the Islamic Revolution achieved victory in Iran, Muslim nations in the west and east of the world felt that a new breeze was blowing over their life and that the atmosphere was changing. They felt that new hopes were emerging.
Therefore, in Africa, in Asia and in any part of the world populated by Muslims, they felt that the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic had offered them new possibilities.
We learned this from our Imam, and this has been the clear path of the Islamic Republic up until now.
Part of the great work is what you are doing.
You have gathered here from nearly one hundred countries in order to become familiar with the pure teachings of Islam.
It is not our goal to export the Revolution to this and that country - not in the conventional political sense of the word "export". The Revolution is not something that can be exported through political means or advanced through military and security tools.
We closed this path since the very beginning.
The aim of the Islamic Republic is to reproduce lofty Islamic teachings so that Muslims feel they have an Islamic identity, so that they become familiar with Islamic teachings which can save humanity, so that they know what Allah the Exalted means when He says He sent a Messenger to remove "from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them".
[The Holy Quran, 7: 157] Due to lack of vigilance, the Islamic Ummah had long forgotten this truth.
The Islamic Ummah can be free, advanced, knowledgeable, glorious and powerful. These things are achievable thanks to Islamic teachings.
For 200 years, the arrogant powers and colonial organizations tried to make Muslims erase this concept from their memory.
The Revolution helped the Islamic Ummah remember these things.
Today you have this great opportunity to become familiar with these teachings in the Islamic Republic, in the scientific center of Qom, in the auspicious society of "al-Mustafa". "Why should not then a company from every party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion , and that they may warn their people when they come back to them that they may be cautious?"
Of course you are living in a foreign country now. Although you should feel at home here, you are away from your relatives, friends and family.
You have to deal with certain hardships and problems. Your wife and your family have to deal with certain problems, but be patient.
During the early years of his prophethood, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was given a few essential guidelines by Allah the Exalted so that he could shoulder that heavy and unique responsibility. Patience was one of these guidelines:
[The Holy Quran, 74: 1-7]
It is necessary to be patient.
Patience means being steadfast.
We all face different problems on our path. The important point is that we should not be overwhelmed. And this was a lesson that our magnanimous Imam taught us through his actions.
He was patient.
He was alone. The Imam was alone in his own homeland and hometown, but he resisted with patience.
They put that great man under different kinds of pressure - both spiritual and material - but he resisted with patience.
A believer is like a firm mountain that cannot be shaken by windstorms. None of these windstorms could shake his steely and firm determination.
He resisted. He exuded patience, and others learned patience from him.
Thus, other people started to exercise patience.
And the Iranian nation managed to foil all these machinations through patience.
You know how many machinations have been designed and how many poisoned daggers have been secretly used against our nation and our government since the victory of the Islamic Republic of Iran up until today.
The eight-year imposed war was one of the machinations that were designed against us.
They imposed an eight-year-long war on us.
Today they are creating uproar about sanctions. But sanctions are not new. The Islamic Republic has been under economic sanctions for 30 years.
The patience and resistance of this nation overcame all those spiteful and hostile actions and all that obstructionism.
Today, by Allah's grace, the Islamic Republic is at the peak of its political and security power. Do not forget patience, steadfastness and resistance.
This is an important factor that should be taken into consideration by anybody who has plans to achieve lofty goals.
You are great assets for Islam. Study hard and learn well.
Live in the atmosphere created by the Revolution and the Islamic Republic, and return to your country at an appropriate time to transfer these realities to your people through the means of knowledge, patience, ethics, humility and love. Your presence in this country does not have a political purpose.
There is a demand for knowledge everywhere.
There is a demand for benevolent words and clear knowledge everywhere.
Imam Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha (a.s.) told one of his companions, "May God bestow His grace on those who revive our command."
The man asked, "How can your command be revived?"
He answered, "By learning our knowledge and teaching it to people."
Then he said, "If people know the virtues of our words, they will obey us."
There is no need to become angry and complain about this and that. It is enough to learn the teachings of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household appropriately and transfer them to other people. These monotheistic teachings, these teachings about the nature of man, these teachings that encompass different issues of human life are by themselves attractive.
There is a great opportunity for you here.
You have gathered here from different countries.
Here each of you has the opportunity to become familiar with your Muslim brothers and their indigenous culture.
Those from Europe can communicate with people from East Asia.
Those from Africa can communicate with people from Middle Eastern countries.
Get to know each other.
Try to become familiar with each other's culture, wishes and ideals.
This is a very great opportunity, which you cannot find somewhere else.
An international center has been formed here for Islamic scholarship.
When you gather in a place and become familiar with each other, an international society is formed for Islamic scholarship.
Make the best of this opportunity.
You are young.
The greatest asset that a youth has is his pure and enlightened heart.
My dear ones, make the best of this enlightened heart.
Strengthen your relationship with Allah the Exalted.
If a youth who is prepared can bring his heart closer to Allah the Exalted through humility, dhikr, solemn prayer and reliance on God, the situation will be the best of the best.
The light of divine knowledge will shine on your hearts.
Avoiding sins, developing a close relationship with God and appreciating daily prayers are among the priorities.
Daily prayers are one of the greatest blessings of God.
They give us the opportunity every day to ask Him for help, to say that we need Him and to strengthen our devotion through supplication and expressing our dependence on Him.
Religious luminaries have always attached a lot of importance to daily prayers.
No, daily prayers provide us with a great opportunity, and it is necessary to make use of them.
According to a narration, daily prayers are like a spring in your home in which you bathe five times a day.
This bathing can have permanent effects on young hearts.
It is through purity and piety that we can receive effective and incisive language from Allah the Exalted as a gift.
Our magnanimous Imam's spirituality, his pure nature, his relationship with God and the tears he shed in prayer in the middle of the night were one reason why a single word by our Imam had amazing effects on the general atmosphere of the country in difficult times and in all conditions.
When the Imam was alive, his son - the Late Hajj Sayyid Ahmad - told me, "When the Imam gets up [to pray] in the middle of the night, he cries so much that ordinary tissues cannot wipe his tears. He has to wipe his tears with a towel."
That man of steel was not shaken by the flood of harms and events that were enough to shake a nation. The power and awe of global powers were hollow to that man. But before the greatness of God, he used to shed tears like that when praying and asking God for help.
I would like to reiterate that I am very satisfied to have met you dear people.
I deem it necessary to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. A'rafi, the officials in charge of "Jame'at al-Mustafa", the instructors and all those who played a role in this great movement.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow His grace and blessings on all of them, all of you and all those who made a contribution.
Leader’s Speech to Students - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 10, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Republic in a meeting with university students in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted from the bottom of my heart who gave me another opportunity in the month of Ramadan to be in the company of you dear, motivated and dynamic youth and to listen to your comments for a few hours.
The points which were raised in this meeting by my dear brothers, sisters and children were exactly the same things that I expected to hear from you dear youth.
That is to say, I may not agree with certain opinions expressed in such meetings, but the spirit of thinking, making choices and expressing opinions with motivation is the same thing that I wish to see among our youth.
I want you to think, choose on the basis of your thought and have the courage to express your opinion on the basis of your choice.
But the spirit of thinking, making choices and dynamism are what our youth need today.
I would like to start a discussion about something, but before that, I would like to make a few points about the comments that our friends made in this meeting. I would say the friends spoke very well.
I have written down the main topics that the ladies and gentlemen spoke about.
I have a few things to say about the election, but I will say these things in the future.
One of the friends reported that a student organization has been formed in order to research economy of resistance.
Such profound actions are exactly what the country needs.
You should think, study and do research.
Your research will definitely benefit yourselves even if it is not good or favorable for the organizations in charge.
This is a very interesting thing to do.
Moreover, another friend reported that a research center has been established in Sharif University of Technology and that it is working on such areas.
These are very important things to do.
The motivation of our young and thinking students is very important for the country.
Of course some of the solutions which were discussed were completely right.
Anyway, it is not the case that our government officials are not concerned about economic issues.
Criticisms were made of certain governmental organizations. There is no doubt that some of these criticisms are valid. I would accept some of the criticisms, but many things that seem possible on an intellectual level are things that are not easy in practice.
Obstacles should be eliminated, but it is not easy to clear all obstacles: sometimes it takes time to do so. It is necessary to pay attention to this point.
For example, regarding the regional issues one of the friends said that there has not been enough action.
I would tell you that in general this is not the case.
The general atmosphere inside the country was also good in this regard.
The presence of our students in different areas, opinions that are expressed regarding the regional issues - all of these things are helpful.
These efforts are being continued and by Allah's favor, their scope will grow and improve on a daily basis.
No, certain things are being done and the measures that are being taken are good measures.
First of all, what she said was absolutely well-thought-out and accurate.
These are tried and true facts. This is why I am so sensitive about the issue of humanities. I never said we should not learn the knowledge of westerners who have made a lot of progress over several centuries.
This is completely clear to anybody who has read the history of the Renaissance and anybody who has become familiar with the people of that era.
There is nothing wrong with benefiting from the kind of psychology, sociology, philosophy, communication sciences and other fields of humanities that have been established or promoted by the west.
I have repeatedly said that we do not at all feel ashamed of learning.
We need to learn: both from the west and from the east.
We work under a master in order to become a master. Westerners do not want this. This has been the colonial policy of the west since old times.
History is one of the branches of humanities.
Once again I would like to advise you to read history.
Read the history of the era of colonialism in order to see what great violence westerns caused in spite of misleading appearance and their claims of support for human rights.
This is not to say they only killed people. They also made a lot of efforts to keep their colonies backward and to deny them the opportunity to make progress in different areas.
What I am trying to say is that we should learn humanities so that we can produce an indigenous form of humanities and export it to the world.
Yes, when this happens, then every single person who goes out of our borders will be a source of hope and confidence for us.
This is why I say we must not imitate westerners in humanities. This is what I want to say as far as humanities are concerned. One of the friends pointed out that in his letter to Malek al-Ashtar the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) had told Malek to publicly punish wrong-doers.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) did not tell Malek al-Ashtar to disgrace people before their offences had been proven.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) never said such a thing and definitely such a recommendation is not Islamic.
How can we publicly identify a person by name simply because an accusation has been leveled against him, an accusation that has not been proven?
We have no right to publicly identify the accused by name.
In a meeting with judiciary officials, I went further than this and said that even if a crime has been proven, public identification of the convict should not be the primary course of action.
After all, somebody might slip and do something wrong, for which he gets punished, but his family, his children and his parents have not done anything wrong to be disgraced. There is no reason to disgrace their family unless this is done out of concern for the greater good.
Yes, sometimes there is a wisdom to publicly identifying a convicted criminal by name, in which case nothing is wrong with doing so.
This is our logic and there is no narration from the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) or any other infallible Imam (a.s.) that goes against this logic.
We do not have any right to publicly identify people by name in websites, newspapers or other places simply because they have been accused of something. This is not at all lawful.
It is necessary to preserve the dignity of people. I was asked to express my opinion regarding the extent to which the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution have been implemented.
Well, I cannot speak in detail in this regard.
No, there are shortcomings, but certain things have already been done.
As far as reforming the High Council of Cultural Revolution is concerned, I would say we have done what we were supposed to.
It is true that there are special procedures for the High Council of Cultural Revolution.
One of the dear youth said that if the young generation wants to take on responsibilities, it should step into the arena. I confirm this.
There are some people who have been involved in theoretical work and are scholarly, but they are not prepared to enter the arena of action and deal with operational problems.
If you do not want other people to walk into you or if you do not want to walk into other people, then you must stay home.
Of course it is possible to stay home or retreat from public life and still do something positive.
But who do you think the people you are criticizing are?
They are yesterday's good youth who worked hard and selflessly and now they are holding a position and doing their responsibilities.
They may make certain mistakes and your criticisms may be fair. But this is the nature of managerial work.
When you enter the arena of management, the same things will happen to you.
A young man or lady will come and criticize you.
Currently you complain why the manager is old and his consultant is young.
This is while the young consultant is a young student, a young MA or Ph.D. student or a young man who has graduated recently.
And he has not made a mistake, yet he becomes the target of criticisms. If a person is prepared for such things and has such qualifications before entering the arena of action, he or she will definitely get a position of responsibility.
One of the dear brothers who spoke very well in this meeting said in the beginning of his statements that we are working like this so that they realize there are still people who want to work.
Do not use the word "still".
No, there was no such expectation.
As far as the Revolution is concerned, our expectations are far beyond these things.
Do not say "there are still people...."
I will start a discussion later on which is partially related to this issue.
It is a very good movement. These were the points I wanted to discuss. I have written down a summary of the comments made by the friends so that I do not forget them later on.
They will be investigated and followed up.
It is wrong to think that these comments will be forgotten.
No, your comments will either be the focus of special attention and work, or they will at least be used to add to our collective knowledge and experience.
That is to say, none of these statements and opinions will be ignored.
The next point that I want to raise is in fact the beginning of a discussion. By Allah's favor, you dear youth will follow up this discussion in your meetings.
Over the past 6, 7 months, I referred to the stability of the Islamic Republic and the Revolution in several speeches.
Of course what happens is the result of certain conditions in which the revolutionary generation lives, conditions that did not exist for previous generations. The Islamic Revolution is a case in point.
They come to suffer from stagnation and deviation, in which case the transformation fails to benefit the people the way it should, but the damage that has been caused by the transformation remains for the people and it is not possible to make up for the damage.
I carefully studied the developments that have happened over the past 2 or 3 centuries - during which great revolutions have taken place - but I did not find a single case like the Islamic Revolution. I advise you to study the history of the same era: you may find a similar case.
They either did not continue at all, like the Russian Revolution, or they continued but with a considerable time lapse and with many hardships, like the French Revolution or the movement that led to America's independence, which might or might not be called a revolution.
The initial goals were finally reached in one way or another, but with a lot of efforts and with a considerable time lapse.
For example, the Great French Revolution has been called "great" because after this revolution two or three other revolutions happened in France over the next 50, 60 years, but the initial revolution was more important and more significant which was carried out in the year 1789 against the French monarchy, the same thing that happened in Iran.
Of course the royal family that was ruling France at that time was far more established and powerful than the pathetic Pahlavi family. They were the Bourbons.
They had ruled France for several hundred years and there were very powerful rulers among them.
As I said the French Revolution happened in the year 1789.
The French Revolution was a popular revolution in the real sense of the word. That is to say, the people were present in it, just like our own Revolution. The leaders were also purely populist leaders with new ideas and they were after establishing a society pivoted on the role of the people.
Of course what they had in mind was not ideological, but they wanted to have a populist government. They wanted to have a democratic government.
The revolution took place in the year 1789.
In only 3, 4 years, the first group that had carried out the revolution was sidelined by an extremist group. Some of the revolutionaries were executed and the extremist group rose to power.
Then the people reacted and remove them from power because of the radical way in which they treated the people.
Some of them were executed and a third group came to power.
That is to say, three different groups of people came to power in 11, 12 years and each new group eliminated members of the previous group.
Over the first 10, 11 years, famous political figures from different revolutionary groups were executed.
Later on the chaos that resulted from these events - it is obvious that chaos would be created in such a country - exhausted the people's patience. In the end, a group with three members was formed and Napoleon was one of the members. He was a young army officer who had made certain achievements in Egypt.
The country that had suffered all those losses in order to remove a king from power, the country that had executed King Louis XVI and his wife turned back into a monarchy after Napoleon.
Of course Napoleon was an active and powerful military leader and he did great things for France.
He had non-military achievements as well, but his achievements were mostly military achievements.
He annexed several European countries to France. He annexed Italy, Spain and Switzerland to France.
He conquered several European countries and annexed them to France.
After Napoleon's exile and death, monarchy remained the system of government in France for around 50 years - that is to say, until around the year 1815. Of course there were very difficult and bitter upheavals. If you read 19th century French novels, including the books of Victor Hugo, Balzac and others, you will clearly see the signs of the upheavals and the hardships and bitterness that the people of France went through.
A republican government came to power. Later on the republic changed as well. There was the French First Republic, the Second Republic, the Third Republic and so on until the country turned into what is known today as France, which is a democracy.
The French Revolution had to face all those hardships.
The same things happened in America. The American Revolution - namely, America's liberation from the British government - took place 5, 6 years before the French Revolution, around 1782.
Of course America's population was not more than 4, 5 million at that time.
Certain figures - such as the famous George Washington and others - came to power, but the same things that happened to the French Revolution happened to the American Revolution as well.
After the initial movement had been carried out, the American nation went through a lot of hardships.
Of course accurate statistics did not exist at that time. The statistic is based on the estimates of those who have spoken or written in this regard. Finally after the passage of around 100 years since America's independence, the American government gradually became established and managed to continue its movement on the original path.
Of course the crimes that were committed and the tragedies that were caused by the rulers and their armies are a long sad story: attacking the neighboring countries and massacre of Native Americans.
I am sorry that our youth do not know about these events.
When a person knows that the civilization, progress and wealth of certain countries is the result of a large amount of vandalism, misconduct, brutality and injustice in the past, he will gain a new perspective on what he has to do and on the duties he must fulfill.
The same things happened in the Soviet Union in another form.
The goals that had been specified in the Soviet Union were not fulfilled. The goals were ideological in nature.
It had been claimed that the Soviet government was a populist government - a socialist government, a government founded on the people and committed to fulfilling their needs. These principles were violated from the early years.
After the Russian Revolution took place in the year 1917, the path of the revolution changed in 5, 6 years. The people were eliminated from government calculations in the real sense of the word. A communist party with millions of members came to power, and within the party power belonged to the few individuals who were at the highest levels of the party.
During certain eras such as the Stalin era, power was in the hands of only one person. However, later on the central board of the communist party had control over everything in the country.
Some of these writings used to be translated into Farsi and I used to read them.
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union many of these bitter and unpleasant dimensions were kept hidden.
That is to say, the revolution was totally derailed from the beginning.
Of course there were also certain pseudo-revolutions in the Middle East region and mostly in North Africa and Latin America, which were not genuine revolutions.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s a leftist revolutionary movement was started in North African countries - namely, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tunisia.
All these countries became revolutionary.
One of these people was Tunisia's Bourguiba.
Similarly, in Egypt, Anwar Sadat was one of the supporters of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was among the people who had carried out the coup or what they called "Free Officers Movement". Basically, during the time of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Free Officers Movement had been started with the goal of liberating Palestine.
Finally, a few years ago, they even cooperated with the Zionists to put a siege on Gaza and to eliminate the people of Palestine.
That is to say, the original movement made a complete U-turn.
The same thing happened in Sudan.
I do not think you remember Nimeiry.
I remember the time when he obtained his first official position. He was a revolutionary officer who actually saved Sudan from the clutches of the west.
Jaafar Nimeiry gradually changed from an anti-west element who had carried out a coup against his pro-western government to a western puppet and mercenary.
The same is true of the others.
I remember that during the 1340s when Gamal Abdel Nasser was in office, we used to tune in to the Egyptian radio station "Sawt al-Arab" in the city of Mashhad.
Gamal Abdel Nasser had travelled to Libya and he delivered a speech on Sawt al-Arab along with Jaafar Nimeiry and Muammar Gaddafi - who was a young man in his late twenties and had just carried out a coup.
They used to get together and make radical revolutionary statements.
Even Gaddafi used to invent slogans that filled us with excitement at that time. We were engaged in revolutionary activities and it was illegal to listen to the Egyptian radio station.
We used to gather in a house at night: one of my friends had a radio and we used to use it to listen to Sawt al-Arab.
This was what the movements were like. That is to say, due to different reasons, revolutions deviated from the original path at the beginning or later on.
In certain cases this deviation lasted more than several decades.
In a country like France the deviation lasted for more than 70 years before they gradually managed to realize some of the original goals - and not all of the goals, but a portion of them.
The Islamic Revolution is an exception.
The Islamic Revolution was a movement that was carried out with specific goals in mind. The goals that had been specified were general in certain cases and they were gradually broken down and made more specific later on, but the Revolution had clear goals.
Demanding islam, fighting the arrogant powers, demanding independence for the country, bringing about dignity for humanity, defending the oppressed, bringing about scientific, technological and economic progress for the country - these were the goals of the Revolution.
A look at the statements of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the main documents of the Revolution would reveal that the goals were rooted in Islamic texts.
Being popular and relying on the faith, beliefs, motivation and passion of the people were among the essential pillars of the Revolution.
This is a very important point considering the fact that thirty three years have passed since the Revolution. This is what I mean when I say the Revolution is stable and established.
Those who say our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way. [The Holy Quran, 41: 30] The Iranian people said "our Lord is Allah" and they stood firm. This spirit was passed on to later generations.
The statements that are made are the kind of statements that would have been made at that time. I used to go to University of Tehran once a week and I used to arrange meetings with students.
And this continued for a long time.
The statements that students used to make at that time were the same statements that you make today. Of course today the comments are more calculated and well-informed.
What next? What I want to say is that from now on the responsibility of our young generation - who are mostly students - is to pursue this path with the same orientation and to move towards further development.
This specifies our responsibilities in academic environments. You are the ones who should do the work.
In the future you will have to shoulder the responsibilities in the country. You will be the ones who will make plans and decisions for the country.
Of course such a decision will not be made. I have no doubts in this regard. Our young generation will continue this path because the movement enjoys religious roots and strong ideological foundations.
For the first time in the history of revolutions in the world, a Revolution has been carried out that will present itself to the world and will pursue its original principles with all its power. And by Allah's favor, the Revolution will achieve its ultimate goals.
You should know that this auspicious movement which is based on these values depends on your motivation, determination, courage, power of thinking and strong willpower.
Thankfully the Revolution has made good progress so far. As I said, we have not strayed away from our goals.
The Revolution managed to preserve its essence by relying on its principles and it has also moved ahead on the path of perfection.
The Revolution has pushed the country forward.
The advances that we see in different areas have been unprecedented in the country over the past few centuries. A few days ago I briefly mentioned some of these advances in a meeting with our government officials.
Of course we had similar achievements in the old times, but the advances that have been made are unprecedented in recent centuries.
The country should move forward.
We are still taking the first steps. We are still at the beginning of our path.
As I said, one of the most important characteristics of the Revolution is that it creates role models.
This is possible. Naturally student organizations have a role in this regard.
When you look at the enemies - namely, the arrogant powers, the camp of oppression, the camp of big international capitalists, cartels and trusts and other such camps - you should see them as a unified front. This is my first recommendation to the student organizations that think about different issues related to students, the country, the Revolution and different other things.
There is a unified front that is opposed to the Islamic Revolution, which is a spiritual, religious, cultural and ideological Revolution.
When you consider them a unified front, many of their actions will reveal their real significance.
This issue clarifies the responsibility of students and student organizations.
Well, this is an act of terror.
It makes you sad that the enemy or some terrorists have targeted a number of scientists in your country. Another way of looking at the issue is to consider the assassinations as part of a large-scale plot against the Islamic Republic. For example, in the eight-year war that we fought with Iraq, when the enemy artillery targeted a particular spot, it did not mean that the enemy was focusing all its attention on that particular spot.
Another possibility was that the attack had been arranged to weaken our front at a particular place so that the enemy could carry out a large-scale operation. When you look at the issue from this perspective, it becomes clear that the enemy is after thwarting the scientific movement in the country.
That is to say, the assassinations should be seen as a link in the chain of the enemy's plots. There are several integrated levels of action, including economic sanctions, promotion of corruption, promotion of addiction, security measures and undermining the faith of the people - both their faith in Islam and their faith in the Revolution.
These are different inter-connected levels of action. One of these levels, which is a link in the chain, is to thwart the scientific movement in the country by intimidating and eliminating our scientists.
This is the perspective we should adopt on the issue.
This is because the issue was big enough, but you should have reflected the importance of the assassinations.
No, this issue must not sink into oblivion. It is not something insignificant.
The issue of science in the country is another link in the chain I explained.
Anybody who fails to gain knowledge will be ruled. This is the logic behind our scientific movement over the past 10-15 years.
Fortunately this scientific movement has produced good results in the country to a large extent.
This requires that we be vigilant against their actions. One of the things that I would particularly like to tell our student organizations is that they should engage in profound, purposeful and planned intellectual and cultural work.
You should do profound work regarding logical issues, moral issues, historical issues and issues that are related to the Revolution.
You should work on different issues of the country - such as the issues which were discussed by the friends.
Imagine that you are doing research about the Central Bank, the health system of the country or the issue of economic jihad, which is very good, but you should not limit yourselves to these things.
Sentimental work should be avoided in the case of political issues of the country.
Avoiding corruption in cultural and artistic endeavors is one of the things that I seriously recommend. Be careful. I can mention a few examples in this regard.
Of course all of them were done around 17, 18 years ago.
At that time I was informed that there were traces of corruption in the ceremonies held by a certain student organization.
I issued a message at that time, but the message was ignored.
It is necessary to seriously avoid and counter moral and cultural corruption.
Today one of the policies of the enemy is to promote corruption.
You should fight this arrogant policy.
It is necessary to counter this policy.
I do not want to suggest that this should definitely happen, but it appears that there should be an organization to coordinate these student organizations so that they can move ahead in the same direction.
Of course the general orientations are almost the same and this is good.
No, nothing is wrong with having variety and difference in student organizations, but as far as general orientations and moving towards the goals of the Revolution are concerned, there should be a kind of coordination so that they can influence academic environments. Student organizations should be able to influence academic environments.
Fortunately our academic environments are good. This is not to say that there are no shortcomings, deviations and mistakes.
Even in the most sacred organizations and environments, you can see certain deviations. But in general, our academic environments are considered to be dynamic, active, religious and committed to the principles.
This is what our academic environments are like. It is necessary to benefit from this reality. It is necessary to influence these environments and to give them an appropriate orientation.
Another recommendation is that our university officials and student organizations should try to cooperate with each other.
For example, one of the friends mentioned the issue that happened in the city of Bushehr.
They should have solidarity. This is because the goals are the same - the same goals that the Revolution is pursuing.
They may have good reasons to eliminate or not eliminate certain fields. This is not my point. My point is that there should be profound work in humanities and that intellectuals should work on this issue.
I think our time is up.
May God protect you.
Dear God, by the blessedness of your saints, bestow Your blessings on our youth.
Dear God, make our youth get closer to Islamic goals and ideals on a daily basis.
Make the holy souls of our martyrs and the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) satisfied with us.
Leader’s Speech in Asalouyeh - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 28, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei to the employees of the National Oil Company in Asalouyeh, Bushehr province.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I am very happy that today's visit to this sensitive and important part of the country resulted in a meeting with you dear brothers and sisters, the employees of this important industrial center and the local residents. This meeting is the last part of my trip.
I am very happy to meet you dear brothers and sisters.
Fortunately in every part of the country and in every sector, there are clear signs that our dear nation is making progress in theoretical and practical arenas. Bushehr province is one of the oldest provinces of our country, and its people have emerged victorious out of the test.
Anybody who is familiar with the history of this region knows that the people of this area have made selfless efforts for the sake of our country, our independence and our dignity.
Having realized the importance of this region, the belligerent and hegemonic powers decided to completely dominate this rich part of the Persian Gulf region during a certain historical stage.
The same colonial powers whose presence had done irreparable damage to the people of the Indian subcontinent - as well as the people of North Africa and East Asia - were not prepared to give up this region.
At that time the people on the coast of the Persian Gulf - especially the people of Bushehr and Hormozgan provinces - rendered a lot of services to the country.
This is the historical background of this region, and such things will never be erased from history.
Today we are going through another historical stage.
Aggressive hegemons of the world are thinking of new methods to spread their domination over different parts of the world and to promote their illegitimate interests - even at the cost of destroying the identity and dignity of other nations.
Over the past years this is what they have been doing in different parts of the world, especially in this region.
What has happened in Iran is exactly the opposite of the goals and interests of global arrogance.
The government which has been established in Iran relies on the people and their hearts, religious faith and emotions. Our government pursues Islamic and Quranic goals - the goals that have been specified in "and to Allah belongs the might and to His Messenger and to the believers."
[The Holy Quran, 63: 8] It relies on the kind of belief that cannot be shaken by any pressure.
It is an Islamic system.
This resistance against the greed of foreigners is enough to enrage the centers of global power.
It is 30 years that they have been expressing their anger in one way or another, but the willpower of the Iranian people - which depends on the will of Allah the Exalted and on their faith in the divine promise of victory - has disappointed the enemies, and the Iranian nation has been treading the path of progress, growth and transcendence every day.
I named this year as "The Year of Economic Jihad".
This means that this year the Iranian nation should focus the major portion of its efforts on the economic arena.
This region is an economic region which relies on production, and production - particularly production that is based on knowledge - is the most important factor which can bring about sustained growth for the economy of a country.
This is true of this region, which is both an economic region and a region for production and knowledge. The production is knowledge-based.
This is what the Iranian nation deserves.
There was a day when the people of this region and the people of other parts of our country used to stand up against the bullying and greed of plundering and aggressive governments in a particular way, but today the situation is more complicated. Today resistance against such powers requires serious efforts which are profound and carefully planned.
Fortunately our nation is familiar with the culture of jihad.
We are not alien to the concept of jihad.
Our nation is experienced in different areas of jihad: military jihad during the eight-year Sacred Defense Era, political jihad since the beginning of the Revolution, economic and scientific jihad.
We are familiar with jihad.
The kind of jihad that we should engage in - namely, economic jihad - is not more difficult than the other kinds of jihad that the Iranian nation has engaged in so far. But we should know what we want to do.
Jihad has a particular meaning.
The efforts made by faithful men - some of whom I met today - are an instance of jihad. And many of you are among those faithful men, and your efforts are an instance of jihad.
The work that is being done in this impressive industrial and economic center is an instance of jihad.
If your intentions are divine, your efforts will be jihad in the way of God. When a person makes efforts to promote justice and Islam and to bring about glory for the Islamic Ummah and the faithful people of Iran, his efforts are jihad in the way of God.
I would like to thank all the people who are active in this area, and I demand from them that they should consider their work as jihad in the way of God.
Do not get tired. You should know that Allah the Exalted has promised success for jihad in the way of God.
If you move forward for the sake of God and on His path, you will succeed.
This year all our people and government officials from across the country should make such efforts for the sake of God.
And Allah the Exalted will bless their efforts.
Allah the Exalted will definitely help the people whose efforts, work and determination have this orientation, just the way He has assisted us during the past 32 years. Without God's assistance it was not possible for a nation to stand up against global arrogance. There are rich sources of natural gas in this region, which we share with the neighboring countries.
You see that all those who are dissatisfied with the progress of the Iranian nation have joined hands against the Iranian nation in this regard.
They help the neighboring countries as much as they can, and when it comes to us, they create as many obstacles as they can.
This shows the meaning of jihad: having a hostile enemy in front of you.
In this case and in similar cases, every step that you take will enrage and upset the enemy. And they will engage in as much obstructionism as they can.
They will try to focus on whatever you need for this progress, and they will try to limit your access to those things.
What is the solution?
The solution is to rely on ourselves and utilize our own capacities: the inexhaustible source of determination and talent that our people and youth enjoy. There are many things that should be discussed in this regard.
Today the officials in charge of this center discussed some of these things during this long visit, and I offered some recommendations.
Everybody has to play a role in this economic jihad, and this is the point that I would like to address to the entire Iranian nation.
As far as managing the economy of a country, consumption is an essential pillar: appropriate consumption, consumption that is not wasteful. And this is something that is constantly recommended.
Now I would like to speak about the necessity of creating the culture of hard work for the sake of God.
Even as a teacher, you can play a role in this economic jihad. You can engage in economic jihad by teaching this culture of hard work to the youth in your class - who are going to be tomorrow's workforce.
No matter where you work, you can play a role in this economic jihad.
It is necessary to help promote justice.
This decade is the decade of progress and justice for us.
From an Islamic perspective, progress minus justice is not progress at all.
For example, the people of Asalouyeh have their own needs.
Contributing to the fulfillment of these needs is an instance of economic jihad. It is part of the great work that we are supposed to do.
Today I had several discussions with the managers and officials in charge of different sectors about ecological issues, pollution and problems of the local residents.
It is necessary to address the problems of the people.
This nation can achieve the position that it deserves through cooperation, solidarity, sense of brotherhood and good deeds.
It is possible to stand up against these enemies through unity, solidarity, cooperation and jihad.
The Iranian nation has managed to overcome its enemies and preserve its dignity so far, and it will be the same in future.
They should not stray away from this path and this orientation.
What I saw during this visit was satisfactory.
They should think of a way to address these shortcomings.
Great achievements have been made, and this shows that the Iranian nation can do anything that it wants.
Feeling of self-confidence is the greatest spiritual asset that a nation can have.
It is necessary to do certain things in this regard.
Our youth will be able to work on these things and by Allah's favor, they will make progress in this regard.
This source of wealth belongs to the Iranian nation.
We have this source of wealth, and this is the most important thing.
If a nation enjoys such a workforce, it can make use of its natural sources of wealth.
But if a nation does not have such a workforce, its natural sources of wealth will be used to serve the interests of foreigners.
Its natural sources of wealth will benefit foreigners more than itself.
Thankfully we have this source of wealth.
Fortunately the general atmosphere of the country is in favor of hard work and solidarity. This situation is the result of the selfless efforts that have been made in the past.
The families of some of our dear martyrs are present in today's meeting.
We should know that every achievement we make today is the result of the selfless efforts of our martyrs and their blood: selfless efforts of our martyrs, disabled soldiers and war veterans. Some of our people went to the battlefields and laid down their lives, but they were not martyred. Allah the Exalted saved their life, and they are still serving the Revolution and the country.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to increase the power, dignity and progress of the Iranian nation on a daily basis.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to help us do our share of work in this great public endeavor and make God satisfied with us.
Leader’s Message to International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to welcome the honorable guests who have gathered here.
It is a pleasure that the Islamic Republic of Iran is hosting the International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament today. Hopefully, you will make use of this opportunity and present human societies with the timeless and valuable results that you will obtain through discussion and consultation.
The study of atoms and nuclear sciences are one of the greatest human achievements which can and should be at the service of the wellbeing of nations across the world as well as the growth and development of all human societies.
The applications of nuclear sciences cover a wide range of medical and industrial needs as well as energy requirements, each of which has considerable importance.
For this reason, it can be said that nuclear technology has gained a prominent position in economic areas of life.
And with the passage of time and the rise in industrial and medical needs and energy requirements, its importance will continue growing, and the efforts to achieve and utilize nuclear energy will increase accordingly.
Just like other nations of the world, Middle Eastern nations that are thirsty for peace, security, and progress have the right to guarantee their economic position as well as a superior position for their future generations through utilizing this technology.
Preventing the nations of the region from paying serious attention to this natural and valuable right is probably one of the goals behind creating doubts about the peaceful nuclear programs of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The interesting point is that currently the only nuclear criminal in the world is falsely claiming to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is while there is no doubt that it has not taken any serious measures in this regard, and it will never do so.
If America's claims of fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons were not false, would the Zionist regime be able to turn the occupied Palestinian lands into an arsenal where a huge number of nuclear weapons are stored while refusing to respect international regulations in this regard, especially the NPT?
Unfortunately, although the word atom is associated with the progress of human knowledge, it is equally associated with the most appalling event in history and the greatest genocide and misuse of man's scientific accomplishments.
Although many countries have made an effort to manufacture and amass nuclear weapons - which in itself can be considered a preface to committing crimes and has seriously jeopardized global peace - there is only one government that has committed a nuclear crime so far.
Only the government of the United States of America has attacked the oppressed people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs in an unfair and inhumane war.
Since the detonation of the early nuclear weapons by the US government in Hiroshima and Nagasaki created a human disaster of unprecedented proportions in history and exposed human security to a great threat, the global community has reached a unanimous agreement that it is necessary to completely destroy such weapons.
The use of nuclear weapons resulted not only in large-scale killings and destruction, but also in indiscriminate massacre of people - military members and civilians, young and old, men and women. And its anti-human effects transcended political and geographic borders, even inflicting irreparable harm on future generations.
Therefore, using or even threatening to use such weapons is a serious violation of the most basic humanitarian rules and is a clear manifestation of war crimes.
From a military and security perspective, after certain powers were armed with this anti-human weapon, there remained no doubt that victory in a nuclear war would be impossible and that engagement in such a war would be an unwise and anti-human act.
However, despite these obvious ethical, intellectual, human, and even military realities, the strong and repeated urge by the global community to dispose of these weapons has been ignored by a small number of governments who have based their illusory security on global insecurity.
The insistence of these governments on the possession and proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as increasing their destructive power - which are useless except for intimidation and massacre and a false sense of security based on pre-emptive power resulting from guaranteed annihilation of everyone - has led to an enduring nuclear nightmare in the world.
Innumerable human and economic resources have been used in this irrational competition to give the superpowers the imaginary power to annihilate more than a thousand times their rivals as well as other inhabitants of the world including themselves.
And it is due to this reason that this strategy has been known as "Mutual Assured Destruction" or MAD.
In recent years, a number of governments who possess nuclear weapons have even gone beyond the pre-emptive strategy based on mutual annihilation in dealing with other nuclear powers to the extent that in their nuclear policies they insist on maintaining the nuclear option even if they are faced with conventional threats from countries violating the NPT. This is while the greatest violators of the NPT are the powers who have reneged on their obligation to dispose of nuclear weapons mentioned in Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. These powers have even surpassed other countries with respect to promoting nuclear weapons in the world.
By providing the Zionist regime with nuclear weapons and supporting its policies, these powers play a direct role in proliferating nuclear weapons which is against the obligations they have undertaken according to Article 1 of the NPT.
These countries, headed by the bullying and aggressive US regime, have posed a serious threat to the Middle East region and the world.
It behooves the International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament to investigate the threats posed by the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons in the world and propose realistic solutions to counter this threat to humanity. This will prepare the ground for taking steps towards safeguarding peace and stability.
We believe that besides nuclear weapons, other types of weapons of mass destruction such as chemical and biological weapons also pose a serious threat to humanity.
The Iranian nation which is itself a victim of chemical weapons feels more than any other nation the danger that is caused by the production and stockpiling of such weapons and is prepared to make use of all its facilities to counter such threats.
We consider the use of such weapons as haraam and believe that it is everyone's duty to make efforts to secure humanity against this great disaster.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei

Leader’s Speech to Cultural and Political Figures - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with cultural and political figures of Iran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
May God make the new year auspicious for the friends, brothers and sisters [who have attended this meeting] and their family and relatives.
I hope the new year will be auspicious and enjoyable for all of you and the entire Iranian nation.
Of course we are partially responsible for this. We are the ones who make our lives auspicious or inauspicious through our behavior and our orientations.
That is to say, the destiny of people is determined by the choices they make.
Allah the Exalted has given us the capability to make choices. "And guide him to the parting of the mountain ways?"
[The Holy Quran, 90: 10] Allah the Exalted presents us with choices.
Of course sometimes the conditions make it easy for people to make a choice. Other times the conditions make the choices difficult. However, one should always make a choice.
Every day we repeatedly ask God to "guide us to the straight path" [the Holy Quran, 1: 6], and this shows that every minute a path branches off from the straight path we are treading - assuming that we have identified the straight path and that we are following this path.
That is to say, the straight path is not like a tunnel that leads to the end once you enter it. It is not like a railroad with no junctions. There are many junctions on the straight path, and it is necessary to identify these junctions and to choose the right direction.
I do not want to say that this is very difficult or impossible.
No, Allah the Exalted has placed clear signs in front of everybody's eyes. "This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were unwarned."
[The Holy Quran, 6: 131] Allah the Exalted will not admonish or punish us for doing the wrong thing if we do not have any means of guidance.
Of course there are certain exceptions to this general rule, but Allah the Exalted generally provides people with guidance.
Norouz is an appropriate name for the beginning of a new year, but we may call this beginning whatever we like. Norouz is a very good opportunity.
It is very good if we divide our life into certain stages.
If life continues with monotonous regularity and new stages never start, one would not think of innovation and new beginnings.
One of the advantages of dividing life into stages is that one would be able to think, "Well, this year is over, and a new year has started." And the new year will definitely bring about new actions, new ideas, new resolutions and new motives.
According to the traditions we and other nations of the world observe, when the new year starts, people put on new clothes and make their houses look new. For example, our people traditionally practice spring cleaning and other such things. Apparently other nations have similar traditions.
Therefore, Norouz is a new stage.
That is to say, they get the opportunity to say, "Well, I had these flaws in the year that went by, so I will start eliminating these flaws in the new year."
This affects all aspects of life.
I believe the most important thing that people should think about is their relationship with God.
At the beginning of each new year, people should tell themselves, "Last year and the previous years are gone, and there is nothing I can do about them, but now a new stage has started." We should define a new relationship with Allah the Exalted, proactively and retroactively. The proactive aspect is related to committing sins.
People get used to committing certain sins, and they do not realize the importance of those sins.
Unfortunately human beings justify their actions, but it is not impossible to critically evaluate one's actions.
Allah the Exalted has provided us with the ultimate proof.
If we look carefully, we can identify our flaws.
If they refer to their inner voice, their flaws will be revealed to them.
Well, human beings get used to certain sins.
Shahid Afshordi used to write down these things.
People like us cannot do so: our self-esteem cannot take this although nobody else is supposed to see what we write down.
It is necessary to evaluate oneself and then reduce one's sins one by one.
The same is true about the retroactive aspect.
For example, I am speaking to you, and you are listening. I am aware that my audience is listening to my speech.
The same thing should be true about praying: we must believe that God is listening to us.
I believe that a person can get closer to God even if he does not at all understand the meaning of what he says during praying - he should just be aware that he is speaking to God.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said, "Daily prayers are a means for every pious man to get closer to God."
People like us may know the meaning and interpretation of everything said during daily prayers, and we may have read several books about daily prayers, but we may still fail to pay attention to the meaning of what we say during daily prayers.
As the poet Saeb says, during praying some people think about anything except God, and sometimes they remember what they have misplaced.
Performing daily prayers in an attentive manner - that is to say, paying attention to the fact that we are speaking to God - is a good start. The same is true about performing one's daily prayers on time. The same is true about congregational prayers and nawafil [prayers which are not obligatory].
Each new year can bring about such auspicious things if we try to make the best of it.
Each of us has a responsibility to fulfill.
Leader Meets with Iraqi Prime Minister - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and his accompanying delegation.
Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence stated that the increasing power of Iraq in the Arab world and in the region is a source of joy for the Islamic Republic of Iran.
He stressed: “The efforts to increase the power of Iraq â€“ especially through preparing the ground for constant scientific jihad as well as through creating a widespread national movement for the construction of Iraq â€“ will increase the achievements of the Iraqi people and government and will strengthen their position.”
Ayatollah Khamenei said that certain developments in the past few months have revealed the power of the Iraqi people and government in the Arab and Muslim world.
He added: “The complete withdrawal of the American troops from Iraq is among these crucial developments. The withdrawal is a great victory that has been gained as a result of the resistance of the Iraqi government and the national determination of the Iraqi people.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that hosting the Arab summit was another manifestation of the power of Iraq. He reiterated: “Certain countries made widespread efforts to show that Iraq is excluded from the Arab world, but by holding the Arab summit in Baghdad, Iraq has achieved leadership of the Arab League.
Having referred to the historical background of Iraq and its position in the Arab world, His Eminence stressed: “Considering this background and the natural and human capacities of Iraq, the possibility that Iraq will restore its position and power is not remote.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution stressed that certain people are opposed to the increasing power of Iraq, further adding: “The power of a country depends on certain requirements and instruments, and the most important requirements and factors are scientific progress, construction of the country and rendering services to the people.”
Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran has very good experiences in the area of launching a scientific movement, adding that Iran has made unbelievable achievements in this regard.
At the end of his statements, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution stressed that brilliant prospects are awaiting the people of Iraq.Â
At the meeting, the Iraqi Prime Minister referred to his negotiations in Tehran and said: “By Allah’s favor, the relations between Iran and Iraq have been expanded in different areas and different industrial and trade delegations from the two countries are constantly negotiating with each other.”
Nouri Maliki expressed hope that his negotiations with Iranian officials will prepare the way for further expansion of ties between Iran and Iraq.
The following is the full text of the message issued on March 20, 2012 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on the occasion of Norouz [Iranian New Year].
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
O Conqueror of hearts and sight, O Planner of night and day,
Dear Allah, bestow on him what enlightens his eyes and his heart (from among the things) about himself, about his descendants, about his followers, about his special ones, about his common ones, about his enemies and about all people of the world.
I would like to congratulate all my dear countrymen across the nation, all Iranians who are living in different parts of the world and all other nations who celebrate Norouz [Iranian New Year], on the occasion of Norouz and the arrival of the new year. In particular, I would like to congratulate the honorable families of our martyrs, our disabled war veterans and their families, all our war veterans and all those who are active in different arenas in the country.
I wish and I pray that Allah the Exalted will bestow joy and happiness on the people of Iran in this new year and that He will frustrate the goals and efforts of the ill-wishers of our nation.
The year that came to an end - the year 1390 - was one of the eventful years in the world, in the region and in our country.
In general, one can see that these events ended in favor of the Iranian nation and they furthered the goals of our nation.
In the region, the nations that have been supported by the Islamic Republic have achieved great goals. Certain dictators were removed from power. The constitutions that were ratified in certain countries were based on Islam.
Inside the country, the year 1390 was a year in which the power of the Iranian nation was revealed in the real sense of the word.
On the political front, the people of Iran exhibited great presence - both in the rallies on the 22nd of Bahman and in the elections on the 12th of Esfand - and they set a new standard for national power in the history of the region. We have had few cases of such presence and such standards in the past.
In spite of all the enmity, in spite of all the propaganda and in spite of all the hostile and malevolent attacks, last year, the Iranian people managed to show and prove their presence on the scene, their dynamism and their preparedness in different scientific, social, political and economic arenas with all their heart.
Thankfully, in spite of all the hardships, we made great achievements last year.
As I have pointed out before, the conditions were the conditions of Badr and Khaybar - that is to say, conditions in which we had to accept and overcome challenges and hardships.
It was announced at the beginning of last year that the year 1390 would be named "The Year of Economic Jihad".
Although vigilant and aware people knew that the name, the orientation and the slogan was a necessity for the year 1390, the subsequent efforts by the enemies throughout the year proved this necessity.
From the beginning of last year, our enemies started their hostile movement against the Iranian nation on the economic front.
The year 1390 was full of challenges. It was full of dynamism. It was a year in which the Iranian nation managed to overcome the existing challenges, by Allah's grace.
A new year has begun for us and God willing, the Iranian nation will manage to achieve many advances through its efforts and vigilance and by relying on Allah the Exalted.
My conclusion - which is based on the reports I have received and on the consultation I have had with aware and well-informed people - is that economic matters will be the important challenge this year, which starts from today. There can be no end to economic jihad.
Economic jihad and jihad-like presence in economic arenas is a necessity for the Iranian nation.
This year I will analyze the issues related to economic jihad.
If we manage to increase and push ahead with domestic production in an appropriate way by relying on God's grace, on the firm determination of the people and on the efforts of our government officials, undoubtedly a major portion of the enemy's efforts will be frustrated.
If the Iranian nation manages to solve the problem of domestic production and move forward in this arena by relying on its determination, will power, awareness and vigilance, by relying on the cooperation and assistance of its government officials and by relying on accurate planning, undoubtedly it will completely overcome the challenges that the enemy has created.
Therefore, the issue of domestic production is an important issue.
If we manage to increase our domestic production, the issue of inflation will be resolved, the issue of unemployment will be resolved and our economy will be strengthened in the real sense of the word, which will disappoint the enemy.
When the enemy becomes disappointed, his efforts and machinations will come to an end.
Therefore, I call on all our government officials, all the people who are active on the economic front and all our honorable people to give rise to a boom in domestic production this year.
Therefore, this year's slogan is "National Production and Supporting Iranian Labor and Capital".
We should be able to support the labor of Iranian laborers and the capital of Iranian investors, and the only way to make this happen is to strengthen national production.
The role that the government should play in this regard is to support our domestic industrial and agricultural products and the role of our investors and laborers is to strengthen the cycle of production and bolster production work.
And the role of the people - which I believe is the most important role - is to consume our domestic products.
We should become used to consuming every product that is produced inside the country. In all areas including the areas related to daily consumption as well as larger and more important areas, we should create a cultural norm among ourselves and consider it our obligation to seriously avoid consuming foreign products the equivalents of which are also produced inside the country.
We are hoping that with this orientation and attitude, once again the Iranian nation will manage to overcome the machinations of the enemies and the tricks of the ill-wishers in the economic arena in the year 1391.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow success on the Iranian nation on this front and all other fronts.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to make the soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) happy and satisfied with us.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to associate the pure souls of our honorable martyrs with His saints in the hereafter.
Leader's Remarks at International Conference on Islamic Awakening + Video and Audio - Khamenei.ir
(O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites.
Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.
And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord.
Indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.
(2) And rely upon Allah; and sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.(3) Surat Al-Ahzab)
I welcome our honored audience and dear guests.
What has brought us here together is the Islamic awakening, which comes from the stronger inspiration and greater understanding among Muslim ummah.
There is no doubt that colossal social upheavals have always relied on solid foundation of history and civilization and are products of accumulation of wisdom and experiences.
Over the past 150 years, the presence of great intellectual and jihadi personalities that have been opinion leaders and behind Islamic movements in Egypt, Iraq, India and other countries in Asia and Africa has served as precursors and pioneers for the present situation in the Islamic world.
The developments in the 1950's and 60's led to coming to power of regimes that were mostly inclined to materialistic ideologies and thoughts, and because of their inherent character fell into the trap of Western imperialist and colonialist powers. These are experiences that are lessons to learn from, and have contributed substantially to evolution of general and profound understanding in the Islamic world.
The Islamic Revolution in Iran that was hailed by Imam Khomeini as â€œvictory of blood over swordâ€, and establishment of the lasting, robust, courageous and progressive Islamic republic, and its impact on present Islamic awakening is itself a long story that deserves to be debated and researched. There is no doubt that Islamic Revolution of Iran will be accorded a thorough and comprehensive chapter in the analysis and writings of history of the present situation of the Islamic world.
For that reason, the present and mounting facts and truths in the Islamic world are not simply events that are severed from the past historical roots, social and intellectual backgrounds to allow our adversaries and the shallow-minded to present them as a passing wave and short-lived phenomenon in order to snuff out hope in the hearts of nations by their warped and biased analyses.
In this brotherly dialogue with you I want to place greater emphasis on three areas:
1. Taking a glance at the identity of these uprisings and revolutions
3. Recommendations to find solutions and prevent these threats and harms. Regarding the first point, I believe the most important element in these revolutions is the actual and mass presence of people in the arena of action, struggle and jihad.
There is a big difference between this presence and the presence of a military group or even armed combatants in front of uncaring people or even concerned people.
In the events of 1950's and 60's in some countries of Africa and Asia, the heavy load of the revolution was not on the shoulder of diverse segments of population and the youth from all parts of the country, but rather on the shoulder of coup d'etat or small and limited armed groups. They decided and acted, and they themselves or the succeeding generation changed their ways as a result of certain motivations. The revolution became its own enemy and the enemy managed again to prevail over their countries.
It is the people that bring their body and soul to the arena of action, and by their jihad and devotion push back and defeat the enemy.
It is the people that make the slogans and set the goals, identify and introduce and pursue the enemy.
Have you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?
(24" Ibrahim ) When I saw the brave body of the proud people of Egypt on television in Tahrir Square, I became convinced that their revolution will triumph.
Let me confess something to you. After the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran which caused an earthquake among the worldly materialistic rulers in East and West and brought unprecedented uproar and joy to Muslim nations, we expected that Egypt would be next in line to rise.
The reason was the history of jihad, progressive thinking and presence of great mojahids and intellectuals in Egypt.
...This sacred secret was nothing but the motivation and resolve to rise, and gradually people of Egypt cemented this thought in their mind and at a historical juncture they manifested their resolve and entered the arena in a magnificent show of their power.
Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, and Bahrain are no exception to this general rule.
In these revolutions principles, values and goals are not written in prefabricated manifestos of groups and parties, but written in the minds, hearts and desires of each and every person present on the scene and are declared in the context of their slogans and behaviors.
With these signals one can clearly tell that the principles of current revolutions in the region, in Egypt and other countries, are first and foremost the following:
- Revival and renewal of national dignity and respect that have been broken and trampled during long years of dictatorial and corrupt rule and the political domination of America and the West.
- Keeping up the banner of Islam which is the profound faith and longstanding attachment of people and being able to enjoy peace of mind, justice, progress and prosperity that could only be achieved under Islamic Sharia.
- Resistance against the influence and domination of the United States and Europe that have wreaked the greatest damage and humiliation on the peoples of these countries over the past two hundred years.
- Countering the usurper and fictitious Zionist regime that the imperialist powers have planted like a dagger in the heart of this region to serve as a tool to continue their diabolical domination after expelling a whole nation from their historical homeland.
There is no doubt that the revolutions in the region that rely on and demand these principles are not to the liking of America, Europe and the Zionists, and they are going to use all means to deny them, but the truth will not change with their denial.
The widespread participation of people in these revolutions is the most important element that constitutes their identity.
Foreign powers that tried everything in their power and used all their schemes to keep in power the tyrannical, corrupt and subservient rulers in these countries and only abandoned them when the people left no choice for them have no right to claim a share in the victory of these revolutions.
Even in Libya intervention by America and NATO cannot distort the truth.
In Libya, NATO has caused irreparable damage.
Had it not been for the military intervention of NATO and America, victory of people might have been delayed, but all these infrastructures would not have been damaged, and innocent women and children killed and then enemies that were accomplices of Qaddafi would not have been able to intervene in this innocent war-torn nation.
People and the elite that are of the people and others who are from the people are the true owners of these revolutions that should be trusted to protect them and draw the path to the future.
2- Regarding the threats and harm, I should first emphasize that although there are threats, but there are also ways to stay safe.
Mere presence of threats should not scare nations.
( Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak) Allah says about a group of mojahids of early Islam:
But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, "Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."
So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them.
And they pursued the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty. )
We need to know what these threats are, in order not to be surprised and to be able to find solutions. We faced these perils and threats after the victory of Islamic Revolution and experienced them. With the grace of Allah and the leadership of Imam Khomeini and sacrifices of our people we managed to sail through them safely.
I divide the harm to these movements into two groups: those that have their roots within ourselves and come from our own weaknesses, and those that have been directly planned by the enemy.
The sense and thought that after the downfall of the corrupt dictator the job is over.
The story of the Battle of Uhud and the defenders seeking the spoils of victory caused the defeat of Muslims, and the mojahids were reprimanded by God. This is a good example that should never be forgotten.
Being shocked and awed by the appearances of the arrogant powers and the feeling of fear from America and other interventionist powers are of these kinds of harm that should be avoided.
The brave and young should throw out these fears from their heart.
Trusting the enemy and falling into trap of their smiles and promises is another threat that needs to be avoided by the forerunners and leaders.
The second group of harm has been experienced by almost all countries of the region during different events. The first harm is the coming to power of those who are committed to America and the West. The West tries after the downfall of its pawns to protect the basic pillars of the system and levers of power, and change the direction by using the same foundation, but with a different head, in order to perpetuate its domination.
This means wasting of all your efforts and sacrifices.
At this stage, if they face resistance of the people, they try to introduce and offer to the movement and people other alternatives that are designed to divert the course of the movement.
This scenario could be recommending government models and constitutions that will again throw the Islamic countries into the trap of cultural, political and economic dependence on the West. This could lead to their influence among the revolutionaries greater financial and media strength of an unreliable current and marginalization of the genuine currents in the revolution. This also means return of the domination of the West and the stronger grip of then outdated Western models that are far from basic principles of the revolution.
If this tactic does not produce the desired result, experience tells us that they will go for anarchy, terrorism, civil war among followers of religions or ethnic communities and tribes, political parties, or even among neighboring nations and governments.
Parallel to these actions, they will impose economic siege and sanctions, freeze national assets and launch all-out media war and propaganda.
Their intention is to tire out and frustrate people and make the revolutionaries disappointed.
Assassination of the righteous elite of the society and opinion leaders, defamation and vilification of others and even enticing some with money are among usual ploys used by the Western powers and the claimants of civilization morality.
In Iran, the evidence and documents from the U.S. Den of Espionage that fell into the hands of the revolution showed that all these plots were designed by the regime in the United States for the people of Iran for them bringing back the reactionary and dependant rulers in revolutionary countries is a principle that prescribes all these dirty tricks.
In the last part of my remarks, I present recommendations for your consideration and selection that are based on our tangible experiences in Iran and what has been gathered from the precise studies of other countries.
Undoubtedly, conditions differ among nations and countries. Nonetheless, there are truths that can prove beneficial for all people.
The first point is that by placing one's trust in God and believing in the repeated promises of divine victories in the Quran and through astuteness, resolve, and braveness, it is possible to surmount all obstacles and emerge victorious.
Of course, the task that you all have taken up is quite grave and momentous. Thus, one must bear great hardship for its sake.
The Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (`a) says: “فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمْ يَقْصِمْ جَبَّارِي دَهْرٍ قَطُّ إِلَّا بَعْدَ تَمْهِيلٍ وَ رَخَاءٍ وَ لَمْ يَجْبُرْ عَظْمَ أَحَدٍ مِنَ الْأُمَمِ إِلَّا بَعْدَ أَزْلٍ وَ بَلَاءٍ وَ فِي دُونِ مَا اسْتَقْبَلْتُمْ مِنْ عَتْبٍ وَ مَا اسْتَدْبَرْتُمْ مِنْ خَطْبٍ مُعْتَبَر..” The important recommendation is that you must always consider yourself as being present on the scene: فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانْصَبْ ( So when you have finished [your duties], then stand up [for worship].)Therefore, when thou art free, still labor hard), always consider God as present and as your aid: وَإِلَى رَبِّكَ فَارْغَبْ(And to thy Lord turn all thy attention), and must not allow your victories to cause you to become arrogant or negligent:
Celebrate the praises of thy Lord). These are the true foundations of a faithful nation.
Independence, freedom, justice, refusal to bow to despotism and colonialism, rejection of ethnic, racial, and religious discrimination, and the outright rejection of Zionism, which, today, comprise the pivots of the movements in Islamic countries, are all inspired by Islam and the Quran.
Never place your trust in the U.S., NATO, or criminal regimes such as Britain, France, or, Italy, which for long plundered and divided your land among themselves.
Behind these smiles and promises lies conspiracy and betrayal.
Find you own way by resorting to the blessed fountainhead of Islam and give back foreigners' prescriptions to themselves.
Another important recommendation is to avoid religious, ethnic, racial, tribal, and border disputes.
Recognize differences as legitimate and manage them.
Reconciliation among Islamic religions is the key to salvation.
Those who fan the flames of religious division through apostatizing others are the mercenaries and servants of Satan, even if done inadvertently.
Creating your own system of governance is your main and seminal task.
This is a complex and difficult undertaking.
Do not allow secular or western liberal or extremist nationalist or leftist Marxist models to be imposed on you.
The leftist Eastern Bloc collapsed and the Western Bloc is propped up through violence, war, and deceit, and does not appear to have a bright outlook.
The passage of time will be to their loss and to the benefit of the Islamic current.
The ultimate goal must be a unified Islamic Ummah and the creation of a new Islamic civilization founded upon faith, rationality, knowledge, and morality.
The liberation of Palestine from the savage claws of the Zionists is also a great objective.
The countries of the Balkans, Caucasus, and western Asia were liberated from the claws of the former Soviet Union after eighty years. Why should the Palestinian people not be able to free themselves from the captivity of the oppressor Zionists after seventy years?
The young generation of today is a source of pride for the past generations.
Trust your young generation. Revive their feeling of self-confidence and benefit them by the experiences of the elders.
There are two important points in this connection:
First, one of the most important demands of the people who have revolted and who have been liberated is to have a decisive participation in the management of their countries. And since they believe in Islam, their desire is to have a system of Islamic democracy, i.e. the rulers being elected through the vote of the people and the dominant principles and values of the society being based on the Islamic knowledge and sharia.
This can crystallize in various countries, depending on their conditions, through various methods and forms. However, utmost care must be taken not to confuse this with the western liberal democracy.
The secular, and at times anti-religious, western democracy is in no way related to the Islamic democracy which is committed to the values and main principles of Islam in its system of government.
The second point relates to the fact that Islamic tenets must not be equated with backwardness, obscurantism, and ignorant and extremist biases.
The demarcation between these two must be pronounced.
Religious extremism, which is usually attended by violence, is the cause of falling short of the lofty goals of the revolution. This, in turn, results in the loss of public support and the eventual failure of the revolution.
In sum, to speak of Islamic awakening is not to speak of a nebulous and indistinct concept that is amenable to various interpretations.
The verses recited at the outset contain a complete and effective set of guidelines, especially in this sensitive and momentous junctureâ€¦ Though, they are addressed to the Holy Prophet (PBUH), we all are their interlocutors and responsible for adhering to them.
(In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
O Prophet!
Fear Allah, and hearken not to the unbelievers and the hypocrites: verily Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.
And put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.)
Leader's Speech at Inauguration of Islamic Awakening and Ulama Conference - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master, Muhammad al-Mustafa, and upon his immaculate household, chosen companions and those who follow them well, until the Day of Judgment.
I welcome you honorable guests and I ask Almighty and Merciful God to bless this collective effort and make it an effective step towards happiness of Muslims. "Surely He listens and responds."
Today the subject of Islamic Awakening, which you will discuss in this conference, tops the list of the issues of the Islamic world and the Islamic Ummah, an amazing phenomenon that will result in the re-emergence of Islamic civilization - for the Islamic Ummah and then for all of the world - in the not too distant future providing that, with Allah's permission, it stays healthy and continues.
Today what lies in front of our eyes and cannot be denied by any informed and intelligent individual is that the world of Islam has now emerged out of the sidelines of social and political equations of the world, that it has found a prominent and outstanding position at the center of decisive global events, and that it offers a fresh outlook on life, politics, government and social developments.
This is considered an important and significant phenomenon in today's world, which is suffering from a deep intellectual and theoretical vacuum after the failure of communism and liberalism.
This is the first sign of the political and revolutionary events in North Africa and the Arab region on a global scale, which itself is a harbinger of greater truths that will come to pass in the future.
Islamic Awakening, which speakers in the arrogant and reactionary camp do not even dare to mention in words, is a truth whose signs can be witnessed in almost all parts of the world of Islam.
The most obvious sign of it is the enthusiasm of public opinion, especially among young people, to revive the glory and greatness of Islam, to become aware of the nature of the international order of domination and to remove the mask from the shameless, oppressive and arrogant face of the governments and centers that have been pressuring the Islamic and non-Islamic East in their clutches for more than two hundred years and have been exposing nations to their brutal and aggressive thirst for power disguised with the mask of civilization and culture.
The dimensions of this auspicious awakening are widespread and mysterious, but what was witnessed of its immediate outcomes in a few North African countries can make hearts confident about the great and amazing outcomes that will be achieved in the future.
Miraculous fulfillment of divine promises is always a hope-inspiring sign that promises the fulfillment of greater promises.
The Quranic account of the two promises that Allah the Exalted gave to the mother of Prophet Moses is an example of this divine tactic.
At that difficult moment, when she was ordered to cast her baby in the river in a basket, Allah the Exalted said, "Surely We will bring him back to you and make him one of the messengers."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Qasas, Ayah 7] The fulfillment of the first promise, which was the smaller promise and a cause for happiness for the mother, became the sign of the fulfillment of the promise of prophetic mission, which was far greater and of course, it required long-term suffering, struggle and patience: "So We restored him to his mother that her eye might be refreshed, and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true..."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Qasas, Ayah 13] This true promise was the great mission which was fulfilled after many years and it changed the course of history.
Another example is the reminder about the overwhelming power of God to suppress the invaders of the Holy House: in order to encourage His audience through the Holy Prophet to submit to His order, Allah the Exalted makes use of this example "so let them serve the Lord of this House" [The Holy Quran, Sura Quraysh, Ayah 3] and says, "Did He not cause their war to end in confusion?"
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fil, Ayah 2] Similarly, in order to raise the spirits of His beloved Prophet and convince him of the truth of the promise "your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased" [The Holy Quran, Sura ad-Dhuha, Ayah 3], Allah the Exalted gives the reminder about the miraculous blessing: "Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter?
He found you astray and guided you."
[The Holy Quran, Sura ad-Dhuha, Ayah 6-7] And there are many such examples in the Holy Quran.
The day when Islam achieved victory in Iran and managed to capture the fort of America and Zionism in one of the most important countries in this extremely sensitive region, those who were wise and quick to learn realized that if they had patience and insight, other victories will come one after another.
The brilliant truths in the Islamic Republic, which are acknowledged by our enemies, have all been achieved in the shade of trust in divine promises, patience, resistance and asking God for assistance.
In the face of temptations by weak people who, during tense times, shout "we are sure to be overtaken," [The Holy Quran, Sura ash-Shuara, Ayah 61] our people have always shouted "by no means, my Lord is with me and soon will He guide me."
Today this is a precious experience that is available to the peoples who have stood up against arrogance and tyranny and have managed to overthrow and shake corrupt governments that are subservient to and dependent on America. Resistance, patience, insight and faith in the divine promise "surely Allah will help him who helps His cause" will pave this path of glory for the Islamic Ummah until it reaches the peak of Islamic civilization.
At this important meeting, which has been attended by a group of religious scholars of the Islamic Ummah from different Islamic countries and denominations, I believe it is appropriate to discuss a few necessary points regarding the issue of Islamic Awakening.
The first point is that the earliest waves of awakening in the countries of this region, which started simultaneously with the entry of the pioneers of colonialism, were mainly caused by religion and religious reformers.
The names of outstanding leaders and personalities - such as Sayyid Jamal ad-Din, Muhammad Abduh, Mirza-e Shirazi, Akhund-e Khorasani, Mahmoud al-Hassan, Muhammad Ali, Sheikh Fazlollah, Hajj Agha Noorullah, Abul A'la Maududi and tens of famous, great, mujahid and and influential clerics from Iran, Egypt, India and Iraq - have been recorded in history books forever.
Similarly, in the contemporary era, the brilliant name of the great Imam Khomeini is shining like a brilliant star at the forefront of the Islamic Revolution.
Meanwhile, today and in the past, hundreds of famous religious scholar and thousands of lesser-known religious scholars have played a role in great and small reform movements in different countries.
The list of non-cleric religious reformers, such as Hassan al-Banna and Iqbal Lahori, is also long and amazing.
Almost everywhere, clerics and theologians have been the intellectual authority and spiritual support for the people and wherever they have appeared in the role of guides and pioneers at the time of great developments and have moved forward in the first rows of popular movements in the face of dangers, the intellectual bond between them and the people has been strengthened and they have played a significant role in showing the path to the people. This is as beneficial to the wave of Islamic Awakening as it is unpleasant and distressing to the enemies of the Islamic Ummah, those who bear grudges against Islam and those who are opposed to the rule of Islamic values, and they are trying to take away this intellectual authority from religious strongholds and create new centers for it.
They have learned through experience that they can easily reach a compromise with these centers over national principles and values, and this is something that will never happen in the case of pious religious scholars and devoted religious personalities.
This makes the responsibility of religious scholars heavier. Through vigilance and caution and by identifying the enemy's deceptive methods and machinations, they should completely shut the door to infiltration and foil the enemy's plots.
One of the greatest calamities is becoming attracted to the lure of worldly wealth.
Exposure to the favors of wealthy and powerful people and being indebted to taghuts of lust and power are the most dangerous cause of separation from the people and loss of their trust and friendliness.
It is necessary to constantly keep this holy Quranic ayah in mind: "(As for) that future abode, We assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard (against evil)."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Qasas, Ayah 83]
Today in the era of hope-inspiring movements of Islamic Awakening, sometimes certain things are witnessed which on the one hand, show the efforts by the agents of America and Zionism to create unreliable intellectual authorities and which on the other hand, show the efforts by debauched Qaruns to drag religious and pious people towards their poisoned and contaminated activities.
Religious scholars and pious men should be extremely vigilant and careful.
The second point is the necessity of delineating a long-term goal for Islamic Awakening in Muslim countries, a noble aim that gives orientation to the awakening of nations and helps them reach a certain point.
It is through identifying this particular point that one can prepare a roadmap and specify the medium- and short-term goals in it.
This final goal cannot be anything less than creating a brilliant Islamic civilization.
All parts of the Islamic Ummah - in the form of different nations and countries - should achieve the civilizational position that has been specified in the Holy Quran.
The main and the general characteristic of this civilization is that it should allow human beings to utilize all the material and spiritual capacities that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on them and on the world in order to bring about happiness and transcendence for humanity.
The surface structure of this civilization can and should be witnessed in popular government, in the laws that have been extracted from the Holy Quran, in identifying and addressing different needs of humanity, in avoidance of rigidity and reactionary attitudes as well as unwarranted innovation and adulteration, in creating public welfare and wealth, in establishing justice, in liberation from an economy that is based on special privileges, usury and taking pride in wealth, in promoting human values, in defending oppressed people in the world, and in hard work and innovation.
Adopting an ijtihadi and scholarly outlook on different areas - ranging from humanities to the system of formal education, from economy and banking to technical and technological production, from modern media to art and cinema and to international relations and other areas - are all among the requirements for this civilization-building.
Experience has shown that all of these things are possible and within the capacities of Muslim communities.
This outlook must not be treated with haste and pessimism.
Being pessimistic about one's capabilities is ingratitude to God's blessings, and neglecting help from God and the laws of creation amounts to slipping into the morass of entertaining "evil thoughts about Allah."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fath, Ayah 6] We can break the chain of scientific, economic and political monopolies of the domineering powers and help the Islamic Ummah become the pioneer of restoring the rights of the majority of nations in the world, which have been dominated by a minority of arrogant powers.
The third point is that in the movements of Islamic Awakening it is necessary to pay constant attention to the bitter and horrifying experience of following the West in politics, behavior and lifestyle.
In more than a century of following the culture and politics of the arrogant powers, Muslim countries suffered from deadly calamities such as political dependence and humiliation, economic plights and poverty, decline of moral virtues and ethics and shameful scientific backwardness, and this was while the Islamic Ummah enjoyed a glorious history in all of these areas.
This statement must not be interpreted as hostility towards the West.
We are not hostile towards any group of human beings because of geographical differences.
