We have learnt lessons from Ali (greetings be upon him) who describes human beings in this way: Those who have the same religion as you, they are brothers to you, and those who have religions other than that of yours, they are human beings like you.
Our complaint against oppression and arrogance and against bullying and transgression is the moral and practical degeneration that has been imposed on our nations by the colonial and arrogant powers.
Currently, we can witness the bullying and interference of America and some of its followers in the region in the countries in which the breeze of awakening has turned into the storm of uprisings and revolutions.
Their promises must not affect the decisions and actions of outstanding political personalities and the great movement of the people.
In this case as well, we need to learn lessons from our experiences: those who pinned their hopes on the promises of America for years and based their behavior and policies on the inclination towards the oppressor did not manage to resolve any problems of their nations or eliminate an injustice to themselves or to others.
By surrendering to America, they did not manage to prevent the demolition of even one single Palestinian home in a territory that belongs to the Palestinians.
The politicians and outstanding personalities who are deceived by the bribe or intimidated by the threats of the camp of the arrogant powers and miss the great opportunity of Islamic Awakening should be apprehensive about this divine threat: "Have you not seen those who have changed Allah's favor for ungratefulness and made their people to alight into the abode of perdition into hell?
They shall enter into it and an evil place it is to settle in." [The Holy Quran, Sura Ibrahim, Ayah 28-29]
The fourth point is that today one of the most dangerous things that threatens the movement of Islamic Awakening is the efforts to foment discord and turn these movements into bloody sectarian, ethnic and national conflicts.
Currently, this plot is being seriously pursued by intelligence services of the West and Zionism with the help of petrodollars and bribed politicians from East Asia to North Africa and particularly in the Arab region.
And the money that could have been spent to bring about happiness for mankind is being used to make threats, excommunicate, assassinate, bomb, shed Muslim blood and to kindle the fire of long-lasting grudges.
Those who consider the unified power of Islam as an obstacle in the way of their evil goals have come to the conclusion that fanning the flames of conflicts inside the Islamic Ummah is the easiest way to achieve their satanic goal and they have used differences of opinion in Islamic jurisprudence, kalaam, history and hadith - which are natural and inevitable - as a pretext to excommunicate, shed blood and cause fitna and corruption.
A vigilant look at the scene of domestic conflicts clearly reveals the enemy's hands behind these tragedies.
These deceptive hands undoubtedly take advantage of the ignorance, prejudice and superficiality that exists in our societies and they add fuel to the fire.
The responsibility of religious and political reformers and outstanding personalities is very heavy in this regard.
Currently, Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, Syria, Pakistan, and Iraq and Lebanon are in one way or another involved in or exposed to these dangerous flames.
It is necessary to be extremely careful and to look for a remedy.
It would be naÃ¯ve to think that all of these things are due to ideological and ethnic factors and motives.
Propaganda campaigns of the West and dependent and mercenary media in the region pretend that the destructive war in Syria is a Shia-Sunni conflict and they create a safety margin for the Zionists and the enemies of resistance in Syria and Lebanon.
This is while the two sides of the conflict in Syria are not Shia and Sunni, rather they are the supporters and opponents of anti-Zionist resistance.
Neither the Syrian government is a Shia government, nor is the secular and anti-Islam opposition a Sunni group.
The only achievement of the plotters of this calamitous scenario is that they have managed to make use of religious sentiments of simple-minded people to kindle this deadly fire.
A look at the scene and those who are involved in it at different levels can clarify the issue for any just individual.
Also, in the case of Bahrain, this wave of propaganda is spreading lies and deception in another way.
In Bahrain, the oppressed majority - who have been deprived of the right to vote as well as other fundamental rights that a nation should enjoy - have risen up to demand their rights.
Should this be considered a Shia-Sunni conflict simply because the oppressed majority are Shia and the oppressive secular government pretends to be Sunni?
Of course, the European and American colonialists and their friends in the region want to make things appear like this, but what is the truth?
These are the things that call religious scholars and just reformers to careful thinking and sense of responsibility and they make identification of the enemies' goals behind highlighting sectarian, ethnic and partisan differences an obligation for everybody.
The fifth point is that one of the standards for judging whether Islamic Awakening movements are on the right path is the positions they adopt on the issue of Palestine.
Since sixty years ago up until today, the occupation of Palestine has been the biggest tragedy that has been imposed on the Islamic Ummah.
Since the first day up until today, the tragedy of Palestine has been a combination of killings, assassinations, destruction, usurpation and transgression against what is held sacred in Islam.
The necessity of putting up a resistance against this warring and usurping enemy and fighting him has been agreed upon by all Islamic denominations and all honest and healthy national currents.
Any current in Islamic countries which disregards this religious and national responsibility out of consideration for the domineering demands of America or under the pretext of unreasonable justifications should not expect to be viewed as loyal to Islam and sincere in its nationalistic claims.
This is a test.
Anybody who does not accept the slogan of liberating Holy Quds and saving the Palestinian nation and Palestinian territories or anybody who sidelines this slogan and turns his back on the camp of resistance, will be condemned.
The Islamic Ummah should keep this clear and fundamental standard in mind everywhere and at all times.
Dear guests, brothers and sisters, never lose sight of the enemy's plot.
Our lack of vigilance creates opportunities for our enemies. The lesson that Ali (greetings be upon him) teaches us is that "whoever is careless about his cause, his enemy will not sleep over this advantage..."
In this regard, our experience in the Islamic Republic is also a source of lessons.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the arrogant Western governments and America - which had long established full control over Iranian taghuts and used to determine the political, economic and cultural destiny of our country and which had underestimated the enormous power of Islamic faith in society and remained unaware of the power of Islam and the Holy Quran to deploy forces and to guide - suddenly realized that they had been unaware and their governmental organizations, intelligence services and control rooms resumed work in order to make up for the overwhelming defeat they had suffered.
We have witnessed various kinds of machinations from them over the past thirty-something years.
In essence, there have been two factors that have foiled their plots: insistence on Islamic principles and presence of the people on the scene.
These two factors are the key to the problems everywhere.
The first factor is guaranteed by sincere religious faith in divine promises and the second factor is guaranteed by sincere efforts and honest clarification.
A nation that has faith in the honesty and sincerity of its leaders will bring in enthusiasm with their blessed presence, and wherever a nation stays on the scene with a solid determination, no power will have the capability to defeat it.
This is a successful experience for all the nations that gave rise to Islamic Awakening through their presence.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow His guidance, assistance and mercy on you and on all Muslim nations.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The 13th of Aban belongs to the most prominent people of our country - our youth - more than anybody else.
And this gathering, which is a sample of the young population of this divine country, is filled with knowledge and insight as well as enthusiasm about great revolutionary wishes and ideals.
Meeting you dear youth, my dear children, is one of the most pleasant occasions for me. This is an opportunity for me to discuss the issues that should be discussed between you and I.
Historical occasions are often like a symbol.
In and of itself, the 13th of Aban is not different from the days before and after it, but it is a symbol. What is a symbol?
A symbol is a code that contains many meanings.
This day is a symbol, and it contains a huge number of important points and issues, issues that are not at all historical.
Let us take a look at the occasions that the 13th of Aban represents.
The first occasion that the 13th of Aban represents is the day when our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was forced into exile in the year 1343.
Why did they force him into exile?
Because the Imam (r.a.) had demanded a national right a few days before in a speech delivered in Qom, which was immediately distributed throughout the country on audio tape and in writing.
It is appropriate for our young generation to clearly understand what difficulties we have undergone to reach where we are now. Americans had tens of thousands of agents in Iran.
This was a bad thing that happened in our country.
Because it was dependent on America and acted as an American mercenary, the satanic Pahlavi regime had gradually allowed those agents to enter the country over a number of years. This was already bad enough, but what happened next was even worse: They approved a law in the parliament of that time, which granted immunity to American agents so that they could not be prosecuted by Iranian courts, judiciary and security organizations. This is called legal immunity.
When foreigners are allowed to enter a country and do whatever they like, when the courts and police force of a country are unable to do anything to stop foreigners, it shows that the country is suffering from an extreme form of weakness and dependence.
Legal immunity was what the Americans demanded from the satanic Pahlavi regime, and it was given to them on a silver platter.
Before the 13th of Aban, in a speech delivered to the people and seminarians of Qom, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) voiced his objection to the legal immunity of American agents.
He said that if a low-ranking American agent insulted and stomped on an Iranian marja taqlid in the country and committed whatever crime he wished, the Iranian legal system would remain totally neutral and nobody would have the right to stop him.
It was only Americans who could have taken action against him, and it is clear what the action would have been.
The Imam (r.a.) raised his objection to that oppressive law.
He had just been released from prison at that time.
He stood up and made the suppressed voice of the Iranian people heard. Of course many people did not even know that the Iranian people were being humiliated like that, but the Imam (r.a.) knew that.
At that time even yelling was considered dangerous. Therefore, they arrested the Imam (r.a.) immediately and transferred him to Tehran.
They did not even keep him in Iran. They exiled him to Turkey. This is the first occasions that the 13th of Aban represents.
Therefore, the 13th of Aban became the symbol of two great realities, two sensitive and momentous realities. One is the greed of the Americans: If a nation fails to defend its rights and honor, arrogant and colonial powers will even impose such oppressive laws as legal immunity on that nation.
This is the goal of the hegemony of the arrogant powers.
The Americans think they have the right to do whatever they want in third world countries.
In different garrisons of the country, when a low-ranking member of the American military faced a senior Iranian officer, he used to address the Iranian officer like a master.
The members of our army were dissatisfied with this situation, but they did not dare to do anything.
The first point is that the 13th of Aban is the symbol of American arrogance. It is the symbol of the spirit of transgression of the arrogant powers against different nations, especially against the Iranian nation.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, different American presidents tried to ingratiate themselves [with the Islamic Republic].
They flattered us a lot in the hope that they will manage to reopen the path that was closed to them.
Therefore, the 13th of Aban is reminiscent of a bitter and crucial truth - namely, the spirit of arrogance that is inherent in the arrogant powers and arrogant hegemony.
The second thing that is represented by the 13th of Aban is the resonant yell of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
Some people may make a criticism or raise an objection here and there, but the shout that spread the message of the 13th of Aban throughout the world in the year 1343 came out of one of the most immaculate throats.
As I said, although the people were unaware in the beginning, they supported the Imam (r.a.) when they heard his shout.
It was that public support which led to the victory of the Islamic Revolution 14 years later.
That immaculate shout was similar to the resonant shouts with which divine prophets used to call the people to God and attract their hearts.
The Imam (r.a.) carried out such a great movement in the country, and he paid the price for it.
They forced the Imam (r.a.) out of his home and separated him from his family, friends and relatives. They exiled him to another part of the world.
Therefore, the second point is that the 13th of Aban is the symbol of such a shout.
Fourteen years after Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) resonant yell, our youth, adolescents and high school students - who were among the most pure-hearted people of our country - entered the arena in the year 1357 and laid down their lives.
The 13th of Aban is the day when students were massacred in the streets of Tehran.
When these youth and adolescents entered the arena and reflected the message that had been yelled by the Imam (r.a.) 14 years earlier, the mercenary killers of America took revenge on them. They opened fire on the youth.
This is also an important point, not just because a number of youth and adolescents were martyred - which is of course important - but because the great movement initiated by the Imam (r.a.) in the years 1342 and 1343 had remained so fresh and dynamic that a number of pure-hearted youth had been inspired to take to the streets, feel responsible and stand up against the bayonets of the oppressive and satanic Pahlavi regime.
Such things rarely happen in the world.
The same is true of today.
Just like those times, today our high school students alongside our university students, Basij and other social groups are among the most pioneering social groups of our country.
Similarly, during the Sacred Defense Era, our students played a pioneering role.
I am in contact with many families of our martyrs and arrange meetings with them. If you speak with these families and ask them how old their children were when they were martyred, they will tell you that their children were martyred at the age of 16, 17, 14.
What does this mean?
It means that commitment, revolutionary spirit and sense of responsibility - which was rooted in insight - have become so strong that even high school students of this country enter the arena and lay down their lives. It means that even high school students of our country are prepared to give up all their youthful wishes in order to achieve great ideals and Islamic and divine goals in society.
The capture of the den of espionage is the last thing that the 13th of Aban represents.
On the occasion of the anniversary of Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) exile and the massacre of students, once again our youth entered the arena in the year 1358 and did something that astonished the world and brought America to its knees. This is the truth. It is not just a slogan.
You should know that the day the den of spies was captured, the American government was several times more formidable and prestigious than today.
America has lost its prestige in the world today, and different peoples are openly insulting and cursing America. It was not like this at that time. America used to be regarded as the world's top superpower at that time.
Our young students - who were acting as the first line of defense in the Iranian nation's camp of resistance - courageously captured America's embassy, and those who were in the embassy were taken hostage.
Of course Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was kind enough to let some of them - like women - return to America after a short period of time. However, the main elements of the embassy stayed here for a long time.
This was also a great movement which undermined America's power in the world. In spite of all that power, America suddenly lost its respect in the eyes of the peoples of the world.
The situation got so bad that the American President [President Jimmy Carter] resorted to a covert military attack to rescue the hostages.
The plan was to regroup in Tabas, go to Tehran, rescue the hostages and take them to America. But the famous event happened in Tabas, and Allah the Exalted destroyed their prestige.
These are the events that the 13th of Aban represents.
The 13th of Aban is a symbol. It contains many meanings, and these meanings are all lessons for us. We must keep these things in mind: American greed, corruption of the satanic Pahlavi regime and its dependence on America, firm resistance of the faith that depended on the insight of our magnanimous Imam and the people, presence of the young generation on the scene and the valor and boldness of the young revolutionary generation against America whose face had been made up to look formidable.
These are all meanings that are embodied by the 13th of Aban.
Therefore, the 13th of Aban is not just an insignificant name.
Just think about it. Last year - the year 1388 - a limited number of unfortunate people took to the streets on the 13th of Aban and shouted slogans against the 13th of Aban in the vain hope that they would manage to smear this great occasion.
Of course they failed, and it was obvious that they were going to fail. But try to see what was behind their movement.
What was it that they were opposed to?
In fact they were expressing their opposition to these meanings.
They wanted to restore the impressive power of America. They wanted to disguise the hegemony and interference of America.
They wanted to question the great movement of the Iranian nation against that great oppression.
When one understands the meaning of the 13th of Aban, one realizes who and what these people - namely, the people who were trying to smear the 13th of Aban - were and what their goal was.
It is necessary to think carefully.
I wish to tell you dear youth that today you are the vanguard of the movement of the Iranian nation.
The Iranian nation has set its sights on the peaks, and it is moving towards those peaks.
Both enemies and friends admit that the Iranian nation is swiftly moving towards the peaks.
Of course there is still a long way to go. We should avoid simplistic thoughts.
The path that lies ahead of us is not one that can be completed in one or two years. It is a long path.
It is not possible to achieve one's goal as long as one does not move forward.
Nobody can achieve their goal by sitting around, daydreaming and yawning.
In scientific areas, in technological areas, in political areas, in different service areas and in construction areas, we have made notable achievements.
Fortunately, today the entire country is like a huge factory, and people are working, rendering services and doing construction work in every part of this huge factory. Iranian laborers acquire skill and gain experience, the people benefit from this and we become independent of the others.
In the past, if we wanted to construct a bridge in a city, we had to invite a European expert. If we wanted to construct a dam, we had to ask a number of foreign governments to do us a favor and build a dam for us.
The Iranian nation is moving forward.
But who are the people who are at the forefront of this movement?
They are our youth, students and young seminarians.
It is our youth who are leading this movement.
It is the youth who are the driving force behind this great movement, this colossal train that is moving forward in a steady manner.
Emphasizing the important role of the youth does not mean that we are allowed to disrespect old and experienced people.
By Allah's favor, today the youth are present on the scene. This is great and very important. You dear youth are the vanguard of this movement - in political arenas, in economic arenas and in scientific arenas.
In the political arena, it was our youth who put an end to the fitna of the year 1388.
I would inform you that after the passage of a few years, international experts will be free to begin writing [about the fitna].
I may not live long enough to see that happen, but you will. You will hear and read what a great plot was behind the fitna of the year 1388.
This fitna is very important.
My dear ones, maintain your presence on the scene.
The peaks that I told you about belong to you.
By Allah's favor, when you grow up, you will see these peaks and you will be a source of pride for your nation.
The important point is that a nation should learn and become determined to move towards perfection.
This determination should never be undermined.
Fortunately, today the Islamic Republic and the honorable people who are supporting and safeguarding it are stronger than ever before.
Today our path is clearer than ever before, and we know what we are doing.
We know where we are going. We know our friends, and we know our enemies as well.
Today the enemies of the Iranian nation have grown weaker.
They are suffering from economic, political and various other kinds of problems. Of course this does not mean that we can safely rest and forget about everything. No, the enemy must never be underestimated.
Our youth are vigilant. They are aware. The major portion of the young population of this country is at the service of these goals - in academic environments, in marketplaces, in schools and in seminaries.
Dear God, make benevolence prevalent in this country.
Dear God, educate us the way Islam wants.
Dear God, help the Iranian nation achieve many victories.
Dear God, accept the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) and turn them into support for this nation.

Ayatollah Khamenei’s Message to Hajj Pilgrims - 2011 - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the All-Beneficent, the All-Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and greetings be upon the Master of the creatures, Muhammad al-Mustafa and his immaculate family and his chosen companions.
The spiritual spring of Hajj has arrived with its freshness, purity and God-given grandeur and majesty, gathering again the faithful and eager hearts like butterflies encircling the Ka'bah of divine unity and Islamic solidarity. Camped at Makkah and Mina, Arafat and Mash'ar are the fortunate human beings who, having responded to the call of â€œproclaim the Hajj to all the peopleâ€, are being honored with the hospitality of the clement and munificent Lord.
Here is the blessed House and the source of guidance from which the manifest divine signs radiated and the canopy of safety was set up to cast its universal shade.
Continuously refresh within your hearts the memory of that father who, in willing compliance, led his Ishmael to the scene of sacrifice, thus showing us the clear path of attaining the friendship of the Glorious Lord and the manner of traversing it with a resolve infused with faith and an intent imbued with sincerity.
The station of Abraham is one among these manifest signs.
The footprint of Abraham, peace be upon him, by the side of Holy Ka'bah is only a symbol of the station of Abraham.
The station of Abraham is his station of dedication and self-sacrifice, his fortitude and resistance to personal desires and fatherly feelings as well as against the domination of kufr [lack of Islamic faith], polytheism and Nimrod, the tyrant of the time.
Today these two paths of deliverance lie open before each of us, individuals belonging to the Muslim Ummah.
Determination, courage and firmness of resolve on the part of each one of us, can advance us towards the same goals to which mankind has been invited by the divine messengers from Adam to the Seal of the Prophets, with the promise of dignity and felicity, in the world and the hereafter, for those who tread this path.
It would be appropriate for Hajj pilgrims at this great assembly of the Islamic Ummah to address the most important issues of the Islamic world.
The uprisings and revolutions in some of the important Islamic countries are the most important among these issues.
The events that have taken place in the Islamic world in the interval between the previous and the current Hajj pilgrimage can transform the destiny of the Islamic Ummah and forebode a bright future rich with dignity as well as progress, material and spiritual.
Dictators and corrupt taghut, allied with foreign powers, have been overthrown in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, and the stormy waves of popular uprising in some other countries threaten to bring down and destroy the castles of wealth and power.
This new chapter in the history of our Ummah reveals certain truths which are all manifest divine signs and teach us vital lessons.
These truths should be taken into account by Muslim nations in all their calculations.
First, a young generation has emerged from among these nations after decades of political subjugation to foreign powers, which with admirable self-confidence, welcomes danger, stands up to confront the dominant powers, and is determined to transform the status quo.
Second, despite the authority and efforts of secular rulers and their overt and covert measures to curtail the influence of religion in these countries, Islam â€“ with its evident and impressive presence â€“ has become the guiding principle of popular expression and sentiment.
The mosques and minarets, Islamic slogans and calls of â€œAllahu Akbarâ€, all are clear indications of this fact and the recent Tunisian elections provide decisive evidence for this claim.
Without doubt, free elections in any Islamic country will rarely result in anything other than what happened in Tunisia.
As this year's events have revealed to all, God Almighty has placed such a force in the resolve and determination of nations that no power whatsoever can withstand it.
With this God-given power nations can change their destiny and receive divine help. Furthermore, during the recent decades arrogant powers, led by the United States, had reduced the regional states to a condition of subjugation through their political and security tactics. They imagined that they had opened up an obstacle-free highway for their rising economic, cultural and political domination over this sensitive part of the world.
Certainly, the political orders to emerge from these revolutions will never submit to the disgraceful inequalities of the past, and the political geography of the region will be determined by the nations in pursuance of their dignity and complete independence.
In addition, the cunning nature of the hypocritical Western powers has become all too apparent for the people of these countries.
The United States and Europe made their utmost efforts to retain their pawns in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, each one in a particular way. But when the resolve of the nations prevailed over their will, they gave an insincere smile of friendship to the triumphant people.
There are other valuable facts and manifest divine signs embedded in the regional events of the past year, which are not hard to discern for reflective minds.
The entire Islamic Ummah and especially the revolutionary nations nevertheless stand in need of two basic elements:
First is continuation of resistance and avoidance of weakness in resolve.
In the Qur'an, the divine summons to the greatest messenger, may God bless him and his family, is: â€œBe steadfast, just as you have been commandedâ€”[you] and whoever has turned [to God] with youâ€”and do not overstep the bounds (11:112)â€ and â€œBe steadfast, just as you have been commanded (42:15).â€ Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, is quoted as telling his people: â€˜Turn to God for help and be patient.
The earth indeed belongs to God, and He gives its inheritance to whomever He wishes of His servants, and the outcome will be in favor of the God-fearing.'
(7:128)
At present, the most significant example of fearing God for the nations that have risen up is to refrain from halting their auspicious movement and avoid being diverted by the achievements of this phase.
This is the important part of piety and fear of God whose possessors are rewarded with the favorable outcome.
Second is vigilance with regard to the plots and tricks of the arrogant international powers who have suffered a setback from these uprisings and revolutions.
They will not sit by idly and they will re-enter the arena with all their political, financial and security capabilities in order to re-establish their influence and control over these countries.
Their tools are bribery, threats and deceit.
The vigilant eyes of the youth, intellectuals and religious scholars should be very watchful.
The biggest danger posed by the camp of kufr and the arrogant powers lies in its intervention and influence over the structures of the new political orders in these countries.
They will do their utmost to see that the new systems do not take on an Islamic and democratic identity.
All the concerned people in these countries and all those who cherish their homeland's honor, dignity and progress should strive to ensure that the Islamic and democratic character of the new order is completely secured.
In this regard, the role of the constitutions will be prominent.
National unity and official recognition of sectarian, tribal and ethnic differences are a precondition for future success.
The valiant revolutionary nations of Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, as well as other awakened and combatant nations, should know that the sole means of deliverance from the oppression and guile of the United States and other Western hubristic powers is to establish a global balance of power conducive to their interests.
Muslims must put themselves on equal footing with major world powers in order to be able to seriously resolve their problems with the world devourers.
This cannot be achieved except with the cooperation, understanding and solidarity of Islamic countries.
This was the unforgettable testament of the great Imam Khomeini.
For months, the United States and NATO dropped bombs upon the heads of the Libyan people using Gaddafi, a vicious dictator, as an excuse.
Gaddafi was the same person who was considered as their close friend before the brave uprising of the Libyan people. They used to coddle him, steal the wealth of Libya through his hands and shake or kiss his hand in order to deceive him.
What government could stop the tragic massacre of the Libyan people and destruction of the country at the hands of NATO?
Until the claws and fangs of the bloodthirsty and barbaric Western powers are not broken, such dangers will remain conceivable for Islamic countries.
Safety from such dangers is not possible except by turning the Islamic world into a powerful pole.
Today the West, the United States and Zionism are weaker than ever before.
Economic troubles, successive failures in Afghanistan and Iraq, deep-running and widening public protests in America and other Western countries, the struggles and sacrifices of the people of Palestine and Lebanon, the daring popular uprisings in Yemen, Bahrain and some other countries under American influenceâ€”all these are significant signs for the Islamic Ummah, especially for the emergent revolutionary nations.
Faithful men and women throughout the Islamic world, particularly in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya should make the most of this opportunity in order to create an international Islamic power bloc.
The vanguard and the elite of the uprisings should place their trust in Almighty God and with reliance on His promise of help, adorn the new chapter in the history of the Islamic Ummah with their lasting achievements, thus earning God's approval and fulfilling the prerequisites of His help.
Peace be upon God's righteous servants.
5 Aban, 1390
27 October, 2011
The following is the full text of an interview with Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, before being discharged from hospital following his operation on September 8, 2014.
Interviewer: Salamun alaykum
Leader: Salamun alaykum and wa rahmatullah
Interviewer: Thank God you are leaving hospital after a week since the operation.
Our enthusiastic people and enthusiastic Muslim people throughout the world would like to hear about your condition and the last moments that you are in hospital.
Leader: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
Thankfully, the operation and the following procedures were conducted in the best possible way.
Now, I am going home with complete health.
My body is healthy, but my heart and my soul feel a heavy burden because of the considerable amount of kindness and sympathy that was shown to me during this time.
I really feel a heavy burden on my shoulders because of the all the kindness that people from different social backgrounds showed me.
There was not a day when hundreds and thousands of kind and sympathetic messages from people were not showered on the heart and soul of this humble person like the life-giving drops of rain that breathe new life into the heart of a dead person or an infertile piece of land.
These messages were delivered by the honorable ulama, maraaje, outstanding personalities, the outstanding managers of the country and people from different social backgrounds.
In any case, I am physically healthy and, thankfully, I am in good spirits as well but I am humbled at all this kindness and sympathy that was shown to me during the past week by different sides and groups including politicians, guilds, people from different social backgrounds, artists and athletes.
A number of them showed their sympathy and kindness by writing to me or by delivering messages through electronic media.
I hope that Allah the Exalted will reward all of them.
As for the issue of the medical process, one point is that I would like to thank the physicians and those who were involved in the medical process.
However, what is more important than this word of thanks is that I am really proud of our physicians.
I am proud that our dear Iran is at this level of medical capability. It is necessary for our people to really feel proud of this large number of physicians - including surgeons, internists, all those who people who offer medical services and nurses.
Thankfully, we have this great source of wealth: this great source of human wealth in one of the most fundamental and vital areas of the life of a society and individuals which is the area of health.
That is to say, I have always had such an outlook towards our medical society. But when one is treated by these physicians, one's information about them becomes certainty. When we are treated by these people, we tangibly feel that we have a great source of wealth comprised of our dear physicians.
And I hope that Allah the Exalted will reward all of them.
Of course, as I said, our appreciation for them cannot be expressed with these few words of thanks.
I told Dr. Marandi - he took the trouble and accepted the responsibility of leading the medical team - that he should thank them on my part with whatever ways and words he knows. I would like to raise a point which is not related to the issue of hospitalization and my health condition.
During the past two, three days, I had a source of entertainment which was listening to the statements of the Americans on the issue of DAESH [ISIS] and fighting against it.
One of the issues which was really a source of amusement for me was that the American secretary of state and the girl who stands there and talks, openly said, "We will not invite Iran to the coalition against DAESH".
First, what honor is greater than the fact that America is disappointed with us and does not want us to participate in a wrong collective task.
This is a source of pride for us, not a source of regret.
Second, I witnessed that all of them are lying.
Since the first days that the issue of DAESH arose, the Americans asked our ambassador in Iraq - through their ambassador - to organize a meeting and reach an agreement on the issue of DAESH.
Our ambassador relayed this inside the country and some of our officials were not against it. But I was against it and said, "On this issue, we will not cooperate with America particularly because their hands are dirty.
How can we cooperate on this issue with those whose hands and intentions are dirty?"
Later on, the same secretary of state - who had said in front of the camera and in front of the eyes of all the world that they do not want Iran to cooperate with them - requested Dr. Zarif that Iran cooperate with them on this issue, but Dr. Zarif turned this down.
The secretary of states' deputy too - the woman whom you know - had requested Mr. Araghchi that Iran cooperate with them.
After they turned down their requests and after we openly said that we will not cooperate with them, they said, "We do not want to involve Iran".
Earlier they formed a so-called global coalition against Syria with great fuss and uproar. They gathered 30, 40, 50 countries, but they could not do a damn thing against Syria.
The action that was taken against DAESH and that broke its back was not taken by the Americans.
The Americans know that it was the people of Iraq, the Iraqi Armed Forces and the popular forces who perfectly understood how to fight against DAESH.
They have fought it and they have dealt serious blows to it so far.
With this move, America wants to find an excuse to do the same thing to Iraq and Syria that it is doing to Pakistan.
They enter Pakistan without any permission despite the existence of a well-established government and a strong army - the Pakistani army is a strong army - and they bomb wherever they want.
If they do this, they will be faced with the same problems that they were faced with in Iraq for the last 10 years.
The point is that hearing these statements in my hospital bed was a source of entertainment.
Interviewer: Thank you very much.
The hearts of millions of pure individuals are behind you and their prayers will always be with you.
Leader: Thank You.
Interviewer: We ask for your prayer for us.
Leader's Speech to Olympic and Paralympic Medalists - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 11, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with Olympic and Paralympic Medalists.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
On the individual level, the youth who win competitions show and prove that they have outstanding qualities.
If an athlete does not have firm determination, he will not be a champion.
This shows lack of determination.
Another point is the issue of intelligence.
This is true of all sports.
That is to say, it is not the case that a physically strong person can win competitions with his physical strength.
Physical strength is not enough. Having high intelligence is necessary.
Therefore, when we look at a champion, we find him to be a manifestation of intelligence, firm determination, physical capabilities and many other qualities.
He does not need to flatter, lie and cheat. He does not need to be hypocritical. Of course, I am not saying that all those who are athletes do not have these qualities.
This is the significance of champions on an individual level.
On a social level, a champion raises national self-confidence because he is the manifestation of the capabilities of a nation in a certain arena.
That is to say, he raises the self-confidence of all people in a country.
This is a very important thing.
On the other hand, a champion encourages all people in a society to move towards this path.
Regular exercise is one of the necessities of life.
It is like eating and breathing.
This is another role of sports on a social level.
Another issue is that professional sports - now that international competitions are well-established and popular - are a manifestation of the capacities, dignity and identity of a nation.
And this is a very important thing.
Today, there are millions and, in certain cases, billions of spectators and they will be aware of this fact. Such a fact cannot be reflected in a different way. An athlete promotes the values of a nation with good sportsmanship and piety.
The fact that our woman athletes enter sports arenas with hijab is very important.
I do not know whether those who evaluate the events of our country have an accurate understanding of this issue or not. This is an extraordinary issue.
This is the case. They are not ashamed of it. Under a certain illegitimate law, they harass women who wear hijab in universities, stadiums, parks and on the streets.
In such conditions, a woman who wears hijab stands on the medal platform in such countries and makes everyone respect her. Is this a minor achievement?
This is a very great achievement.
Everybody should appreciate from the bottom of their heart the value of woman athletes who participate in international arenas with hijab and modesty.
What they do is really astonishing. When people look at these athletes, they see that not only does their disability not prevent them from living in a normal way, but they are also so determined that they become athletes and stand on the medal platform.
This shows the determination of a nation.
This shows the dignity and identity of a nation.
I really feel that you are rendering services to your country and your people by winning competitions.
You convey messages that cannot be conveyed by any other means. You convey the message of determination, resistance and faith. When our athletes achieve a victory in such arenas and when they are ranked first, they chant the slogan of "Ya Hussein", prostrate themselves and hold up their hands and thank God.
Do you know how excited the Islamic Ummah and Muslim nations become when you do this?
In sports arenas, our outstanding youth - not ordinary youth - give such prominence to spirituality in a world in which there is an effort to make young individuals decadent and turn their backs on spirituality. What our athletes do is very effective and important.
Fortunately, Islamic Iran has made astonishing progress in this area since the victory of the Islamic Revolution until today.
Today, you are ahead of others in many arenas.
But even if we consider all sports together, the situation is the same.
Imagine that in an international sports competition - such as the recent one - you participate with 54 athletes and you win 12 medals. Imagine that America participates with 530 athletes and it wins 110 medals.
If America wants to win as many medals as you do, it should win 120 medals. It participates with 10 times more athletes than you do.
This means that if you participate in different sports with as many athletes as America and with the same quality, you will be ahead of all your opponents.
These are valuable achievements.
Fortunately, the same is true of scientific areas.
These are our capacities. This is our country.
That is why our history is so outstanding.
People like Ibn Sina [Avicenna], Zakariya Razi, Farabi, Saadi, Hafiz and other such people cannot be born in a low-level society.
This shows that enormous capacities exist in this area of the world.
Today, fortunately, the Revolution has acted in a way that these capacities can develop in all areas, particularly sports.
These are your characteristics.
And the thing that you do is, in fact, a movement towards peaks.
As I said, you are the ambassadors of Iran who represent the Iranian nation's identity and dignity.
You should preserve these characteristics. The fact that you introduce your nation as a determined, religious, talented and noble nation which is committed to sharia is very valuable.
You should take care not to let this change.
The youth of the country look up to you.
You promote sports in practice. I would tell you that you should promote it in words too.
That is to say, you should encourage the youth of the country through interviews and the speeches that you deliver in the media, television and other such things.
Share your experience in sports so that the youth will be excited.
We need all the people in our country to do sports activities.
The existence of a healthy manpower is of prime importance to the country because a country makes progress with its manpower.
Natural resources, mines and natural wealth are good things, but if there is no manpower, if there is no human capacities in a country, it will face the same situation that a number of countries which have these natural resources do.
Physical health is the main condition for the existence of such manpower. If people turn to sports activities, many social and behavioral problems - such as addiction, family rows, financial and psychological problems and other such problems - will be solved. Many of our problems will be solved if sports activities become truly common among all the people in our country.
Of course, today the situation is a lot better than the past, but we still need to improve this. You can play a role in this regard.
That is to say, you can strengthen morality and promote Iranian traditions.
The fact that our youth refused to compete with Zionist athletes in sports arenas is very valuable.
That is why arrogant powers became so angry.
This move, which was made by our youth, is very important. It is truly a crucial and important diplomatic effort to confront the Zionist regime.
I would like to stress the issue of morality in sports.
Our friends in this meeting spoke about it.
There are certain dangers.
We should hold this danger at bay.
The issue of morality in sports is very important.
Being humble, being loyal and sympathetic to the people and exercising good sportsmanship are very important qualities.
It is one thing to achieve these qualities, it is quite another to preserve these qualities.
One should preserve these qualities. In my opinion, a number of people destroy the sporting environment by making accusations, causing rows, spreading false rumors and damaging the reputation of individuals.
Unfortunately, the media which broadcast sporting events have played a major role in committing these illegal actions. I deem it necessary to warn them in this regard.
Media networks which broadcast sporting events find a trivial issue to use against a certain team, a certain athletics federation and a certain athlete.
They use it as a tool to pit this against that, to cause rows and make them give a controversial interview.
The more harshly an interviewee speaks, the more inappropriate things he says and the more he curses in his interview, the happier these media networks will be.
Another issue which I have spoken about many times - this is related to officials in charge of sporting activities - is that you should take the issue of prioritizing different sports into consideration.
I have referred to a number of such sports in recent years.
Well, in such and such sports, we do not at all rank high in the world and we have no chance to do so. We are unlikely to rank high in such sports.
Of course, there are certain reasons for this.
But in certain sports, we are ranked high in the world.
Today, you stand on the medal platform in a number of sports such as wrestling, weightlifting or other sports. This is very important.
A few years ago - I do not remember which year it was - I had a meeting with my athlete friends.
It is our sport and it is a good sport.
It is an entertaining and exciting sport.
We have a talent for this sport in Iran.
Throughout history, chowgan has been a well-known sport in Iran.
One of the brothers in this meeting said that we should benefit from foreign coaches.
You should not think that I am opposed to hiring a good and competent foreign coach.
But when you benefit from a native coach for soccer, basketball, volleyball, wrestling or any other sports, I become happy and I feel a sense of pride.
It is very good that the coach of our athletes and our youth is one of us and is nurtured here.
Of course, some foreign coaches are good and some others are not good and they take a lot of money, they have high expectations and sometimes they do not carry out their duties.
Therefore, this is what I mean when I sometimes speak about foreign coaches.
This is what I mostly speak about. I have spoken about this issue many times.
As other scientific research, the research that is carried out in the world on a specific sport is not the last word.
It is possible to carry out research on the basis of such research or add new things to it in order to improve or even reject it.
Well, you should do such things in Iran.
We have managed to do things which the enemy could not even imagine.
That is to say, it would have to go through several mazes.
If we had decided to buy nuclear fuel for the research reactors that we have, they would not have given a bit of it to us without making the Iranian nation completely humiliated.
Once I said that if the oil that we have, belonged to the Europeans and if we wanted to buy oil or petroleum from them, they would sell each barrel of it to us at an exorbitant price. They are such people.
They thought that we would have to buy the 20-percent fuel from them and we would give in to their demands. That is why they created such obstacles.
But our youth carried out research on it and they themselves produced the 20-percent fuel.
Now, they are faced with a fait accompli that the Iranian nation presented them with. Such complex and great work is being carried out.
Why do not we carry out great work in sports? The rules and practices that exist in sports - whether individual sports such as wrestling and weightlifting or team sports - should be researched.
It is possible to develop such guidelines for them.
In any case, I hope that Allah the Exalted will help all of you succeed.
I express my deep gratitude to all of you and all the young athletes for the things that they did in international arenas such as saying adhan after conquering the peaks of success, prostrating themselves, praying, mentioning the name of our infallible Imams (a.s.) and wearing hijab. May God bestow success on you.
You are very popular among the people of Iran and I hope you will remain popular forever.
Leader's Speech on the Occasion Eid al-Ghadir - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Mercifulâ€Œ
I would like to congratulate all the dear audience, the dear brothers and sisters, the dear people of Iran, all Shia Muslims and all those people who feel proud of and who enjoy the truths of Islam and knowledge about the content of this holy religion on the occasion of the auspicious day of Eid al-Ghadir.
And I welcome all the dear participants, particularly the dear brothers and sisters who have come from distant cities and who have ornamented this meeting with their presence.
I would like to say a few things about the issue of Ghadir and then I will say a few things about the responsibilities that the issue of Ghadir and awareness about the deep lessons of Ghadir entrusts to us.
The issue of Ghadir is a very important issue in the history of Islam.
First, the essence of this astonishing and important event and this holy statement - "Whomsoever's Moula [leader] I am, Ali is also his Moula" - is not something that has been narrated by Shia only. This event is among clear and absolute truths.
Those who wanted to find faults with this event did not cast doubts on the origin of this statement. Rather, they resorted to ta'weel and interpretation of this sentence.
The issue of Ghadir is a clear historical and Islamic issue. The doubts and questions - about the meaning of this sentence - that have come to the minds of some intellectual and philosophical newcomers of today are the same doubts and questions that have been raised since a thousand years ago.
Therefore, there is not any room for raising doubts about the essence of this issue, this event and what the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said. On that day, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) asked the people, "Am I not closer to you than your own selves?" This sentence was a reference to a Quranic ayah which said, "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves" [The Holy Quran, 33: 6].
So, there is not any room for doubt about the essence of this issue. What should be said about the content of this historical, holy and meaningful sentence - apart from the appointment of the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) as the caliph and Imam after the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) which is the common meaning of this sentence - is that there is another important issue which should not be ignored.
The answer to those people who have tried to throw Islam out of the arena of social and political issues, to confine it to personal and individual affairs and to adopt a secular outlook towards Islam - the hands of the enemies and their propaganda efforts have been promoting this outlook among Muslims for many years - is the issue of Ghadir.
At the command of Allah the Exalted, the Holy Prophet (God's greetings be upon him and his household) addressed an important and fundamental issue in that sensitive condition and during the last months of his life. This important issue was attending to the issue of government after the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) time.
Here, the appointment of the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) was not confined to spiritual aspects.
Rather, it can be said that spiritual aspects are not things that someone can be appointed and elected for.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) recommended this to the people.
This is an important point on the issue of Ghadir and it is a rejoinder to all those people who think and promote the idea that Islam should be kept away from political issues, issues related to the government and the like.
Therefore, these two truths - that is to say, the truth about the appointment of the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) as the Imam after the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the truth about attending to the issue of government, politics, imamate and managing the Islamic Ummah after the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) - and these two very important and sensitive issues exist in the event of Ghadir.
They are among teachings that have been guaranteed by Ghadir and they are a great lesson for all Muslims, whether for their present time or for their future.
Today, what we should pay attention to is that the issue of Ghadir is an ideological issue.
Shia and the followers of the school of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the school of imamate are committed to the issue of Ghadir.
Without a doubt, this is the base of Shia philosophy and there is no room for any discussion on this issue.
Those who doubt this and those who have a question in this regard can take part in scholarly and expert meetings and discuss it. Shia's logic is strong.
However, this should not influence the public lives of Muslims, their cooperation with and brotherhood towards one another.
The issue of differences between Muslim denominations - whether Shia and Sunni denominations or the different denominations that exist inside these two major denominations - has been one of the targets of the greed of the enemies of Islam, not just the enemies of Shia Islam.
For many years, there has been an effort to create discord between Muslims.
This is because the existence of discord between Muslims will make them spend their efforts, energy and motivation on domestic fights.
This has been the major policy of colonialism for many years and after the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the formation of the Islamic Republic.
Because they witnessed the development of the Islamic Republic's thoughts in the world of Islam, they placed more emphasis on and showed more persistence in creating discord.
They invested in doing this in order to separate the world of Islam from the Islamic Republic.
The Islamic Republic, our great Revolution and our great Imam (r.a.) managed to attract the thoughts of the world of Islam and the hearts of Muslims.
This frightened colonialism, arrogance and Zionism - particularly American politicians.
As a result of this, they resorted to their old weapon which is the weapon of creating discord.
Since many years ago until today, they have been fueling the fire of discord between Shia and Sunni so that they can divert the attention of the two sides from the main enemy - who is the enemy of Islam, not the enemy of Shia or Sunni in particular - and so that they can busy them with each other.
This is the policy of colonialism.
They have experience in the ways for doing this.
Therefore, they know how to do it and they are extremely active in this arena.
This takfiri orientation - the thing that has emerged in Iraq, Syria and some other regional countries today and that confronts all Muslims, not just Shias - is the handicraft of colonialists themselves.
They made something called al-Qaida and DAESH in order to confront the Islamic Republic and the movement of the Islamic Awakening. However, this product has become a burden for themselves.
Of course, if we take a careful and analytical look today, we see that the unreal effort which America and its allies are making in the region today under the name of confronting DAESH is, in fact, an effort for channeling enmities among Muslims more than it is an effort for nipping this evil movement in the bud.
They are trying to divert Muslims' attention from the main enemy.
We - whether Shia and Sunni Muslims or anyone who is committed to Islam and who believes in the authority of the Holy Quran - should know that America and American, arrogant and Zionist policies are the enemy of Islam, Islamic awareness and the rule of Islam.
The effort that they are making today is the continuation of the effort that they have been making for 35 years.
It is 35 years now that they have been making all sorts of efforts. However, by God's permission and grace, they were defeated in all the efforts that they made against the Islamic Republic.
By Allah's favor, they will definitely be defeated in this one as well.
What the responsibility of Muslims - whether Shia or Sunni Muslims - is, is that they should not help the enemy by provoking the feelings of one another.
Shia should know that if there is a fight between Shia and Sunni and if feelings are provoked, it is the common and the main enemy who will benefit from this.
Therefore, it should not let this happen.
The two sides should be careful.
They should not provoke each other's feelings, they should not insult each other's holy beliefs and they should not fuel the fire of discord between Muslim tribes and groups - particularly between Shia and Sunni - because this is what the enemies of Islam want.
Everyone should pay attention to this.
If someone does something to provoke the feelings of the other side and to create enmity, they should certainly know that they are helping America, vile England and Zionism. They should know that they are helping those people who create DAESH, al-Qaida and the like and who create the takfiri orientation in order to create discord between Shia and Sunni.
Today, Islamic unity, Islamic brotherhood and Islamic solidarity is one of the most necessary and urgent responsibilities for all Islamic societies.
All of us should be committed to this responsibility.
I hope that God bestows success on all of you and I hope that He will help all of you and the entire world of Islam to benefit from the blessings of Eid al-Ghadir.
Leader’s Message to International Conference on Global Fight Against Terrorism - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the message issued on June 25, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to the participants of the International Conference on Global Fight Against Terrorism.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Dear guests and honorable audience, welcome.
I would like to thank you for coming together to discuss one of the tragic phenomena currently afflicting humanity - namely, terrorism.
By Allah's favor, such discussions, which should undoubtedly continue and result in a conscious determination and sincere effort in the global community, will be an essential step towards curbing terrorism and saving humanity from this agonizing phenomenon.
Having faith in God's guidance and assistance, we will pursue this issue in a hopeful way, and we will move ahead accompanied by all sincere and empathetic people and all those who feel responsible.
It is not a product of modern times. But the introduction of dreadful weapons, which facilitated tragic mass killings, has made this reprehensible phenomenon a hundred times more fearsome and dangerous.
Another important and shocking point is the evil calculations of the hegemonic powers which have introduced terrorism into the cycle of their policies and plans as a tool to achieve their illegitimate goals.
The historical memory of the nations of our region will never forget how colonial governments organized ruthless terrorist organizations such as the World Zionist Organization and more than ten similar other organizations and how they gave rise to the Deir Yassin tragedy and similar events in order to occupy Palestine and to force its oppressed people out of their homes.
Since its establishment up until today, the Zionist regime has openly continued its terrorist activities inside and outside Palestine, and it has shamelessly announced them.
Current and previous leaders of the Zionist regime openly take pride in their history of terror and - in certain cases - their participation in terrorist activities.
The regime of the United States of America is another example, a regime that has left a long trail of terrorist activities as well as financial and arms support for organized terrorists in the regional countries.
Deadly raids of drones on defenseless families in the villages and underprivileged areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have turned weddings into mourning ceremonies on many occasions, the Blackwater crimes in Iraq and the killing of Iraqi civilians and prominent figures, supporting bombers in Iran, Iraq and Pakistan, assassinating nuclear scientists in Iran with the cooperation of MOSSAD, shooting down the Iranian passenger plane in the Persian Gulf and killing around 300 innocent children, men and women - these are examples of this disgraceful and unforgettable trail of crimes.
America, England and certain other western governments, with their dark and incriminating record in terrorist activities, have added claims of fighting terrorism to the list of their extravagant claims.
The terrorists who ruthlessly murdered thousands of people in the 1360s are now living under the support of European governments and statesmen, the same terrorists who assassinated 72 scientific and political figures and high-ranking officials of Iran on one occasion, and assassinated our president and prime minister on another occasion.
With such behaviors, claims of fighting terrorism are extremely shameless.
From the perspective of the leaders of the order of domination, terrorism is whatever that threatens their illegitimate interests.
They label as terrorists the resistance fighters who are defending their legitimate right of countering occupiers and interferers, but they do not recognize as terrorists their evil and mercenary centers which are threatening the life and security of innocent people.
One of the essential things that this conference can do is to present a clear and accurate definition of terrorism.
Relying on Islamic teachings - according to which human dignity is a top priority and according to which killing a single innocent person is like killing all human beings - and as a nation which has suffered great losses during the past three decades as a result of terrorism, we think of fighting this evil phenomenon as our fundamental responsibility, and by Allah's favor, we will continue our efforts on the path of this great struggle with all our power.
Greetings be upon you and upon God's servants
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Leader’s Comments in a Book on Hajj - Khamenei.ir
This book plunged me once again into the nostalgic excitement and enthusiasm of visiting the House of God and the shrine of His Messenger (s.w.a.), the kind of excitement and enthusiasm which I am no longer very hopeful about.
As far back as I can remember â€“ since the days of my youth â€“ I have never found my heart free of the flames of this enthusiasm.
During the dark era of suppression, every cleric, knowledgeable or not, could easily register for hajj pilgrimage out of enthusiasm or even out of indulgence, but I could not do so.
In other words, for fear of the Shah's SAVAK, no caravan leader was able or courageous enough to put my name on the list of hajj pilgrims, let alone assign me as the cleric in charge of the caravan.
Yes, even during those difficult times, my heart was not free of the hope of visiting Ka'bah and kissing the footprints of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) in Mecca and Medinaâ€¦. And although my wish was fulfilled during the 10-day hajj pilgrimage of the year 1358 thanks to Shahid Mahallati, the flames of that enthusiasm became brighter and stronger.
When I was President, I had pinned my hopes on having this opportunity after my presidential terms.
But todayâ€¦? Restless enthusiasm and faint hopeâ€¦. I only find solace in reading or listening to such travelogues, which itself increases my enthusiasm even more.
Leader’s Speech to Naval Forces in Bandar Abbas - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on July 24, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Republic in a meeting with the naval forces of the Army and the Revolutionary Guards in the port city of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me this opportunity to renew our covenant and hold another meeting with you dear youth and you dear commanders and personnel [of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Navy].
I assure you that what you are doing in the naval forces of the Army and the Revolutionary Guards is one of the most effective things that can be done: making up for the backwardness that we suffered for many years because satanic governments failed to prepare the ground for the progress of our maritime industry and the presence of Iran's Navy [in international waters].
As we all know, the sea provides a great opportunity for a country to make progress and to protect its national interests.
The sea brings about strategic advantages for a country and a nation: considerable and wide-ranging advantages.
Certain countries managed to spread their power to far-away territories in four centuries by controlling the sea and developing maritime industry. Nations were oppressed. Territories were occupied.
National resources were squandered. But through these oppressive measures, the governments and countries that had control over the sea managed to gain power and accumulate wealth for themselves.
For many years the nations of our region - both in the Persian Gulf and in the Gulf of Oman - were used to obeying the bullying people who entered this region sailing in their warships. The nations of our region had to keep silent and listen to them.
This was the case in this region for many years.
Today everything has changed.
The long coast that belongs to the Iranian nation is being controlled by an independent government and a proud and vigilant nation - a nation that relies on Allah the Exalted, a nation that knows its power and is proud of it, a nation whose willpower overwhelms any domineering political and military power, a nation that forces back all those who want to impose their rule on nations.
In spite of the unpleasant and detrimental presence of warships from different European and North American countries, today the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman are free and independent, thanks to the presence of the Islamic Republic and the powerful Iranian nation.
There was a day when certain people used to come to our region and determine the destiny of this region through their military presence, but those days are gone.
Today nations know that foreigners' military presence in a region - in any region and not just in our region - is a source of insecurity for that region.
The security of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman will be ensured only through the presence of the countries of the region and their cooperation.
The benefits of these waters belong to everybody.
The advantages belong to the nations of the region. How can the regional nations use these blessings to further their national interests?
This power can be ensured by you members of the Armed Forces who are very familiar with the meaning of jihad and selflessness. Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic, we have never provoked any power or any country into confrontation and war. And we will try as much as we can to avoid any kind of calculated or accidental confrontation.
Every day and night of your life and any operational, logistical or training responsibility that you have is a good deed, a measure to further the interests of the Iranian nation and to increase the glory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Allah the Exalted will take all these selfless efforts into account and He will reward you for these efforts.
Make as many efforts as you can on this sacred path in a sincere and selfless way and know that this country is indebted to you dear youth who show its power.
With the presence of the Armed Forces, there are many accomplishments to make in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
Governmental organizations and different government officials have a duty to cooperate with the Armed Forces as much as needed so that these accomplishments can be made in the best possible way.
I am happy to be among you dear youth, government officials, managers and commanders of the Armed Forces in this region. I am thankful to God.
As the dear youth said, I just want to tell you that Allah the Exalted will reward you and He will help you, your families and your relatives benefit from divine blessings and the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake). Greetings be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings
Leader’s Speech at Imam Ali (a.s.)
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on November 10, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to a group of cadets in a graduation ceremony at Imam Ali (a.s.)
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to extend my congratulations to all the dear graduates of the military academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran and all the dear youth who have received epaulets and joined the ranks of the mujahids of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army.
The fact that so many faithful and sincere youth â€“ graduates and students â€“ join the great Army and Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic is worthy of congratulating.
You should also thank God for these great blessings.
Military academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran are the centers of knowledge and jihad.
The scent of spirituality and piety in these academies keeps getting stronger on a daily basis.
This is a cause for joy and happiness.
These academies are active in terms of scientific work and they enjoy active students, good teachers and commanders who are also outstanding scientific figures. Moreover, the atmosphere of mujahid-like and pious preparedness, the war games, undergoing military training in the hot weather of summer during the month of Ramadan, the large number of cadets who fast once or more every week â€“ these are things that are unprecedented not only in the Armed Forces of our country but also in the armed forces of the world of Islam.
These things are the result of the firm determination of a nation that has been making efforts to raise the flag of faith, Islam and piety.
Members of the Armed Forces â€“ who study, undergo training, make efforts and prepare themselves for the sake of God and divine ideals and who enter the arena selflessly whenever there is an opportunity for selfless struggle and defense â€“ are a source of power for Islam and Muslims.
They are a source of power for the country.
You are powerful for two reasons.
First, you spend the valuable days of your youth on acquiring knowledge and engaging in jihad with sincere spirituality and faith.
This is power. â€œAnd to Allah belongs the might and to His Messenger and to the believers.â€ [The Holy Quran, 63: 8] Power belongs to God, His Messenger and believers.
So you are considered among believers.
The second reason is that you are a source of power for your country and your nation.
A nation that can prove it is prepared to resist and defend itself in order to have independence, preserve its identity and fight for its ideals and existence â€“ such a nation is powerful.
The power of such a nation is secretly acknowledged even by its enemies although they might not be prepared to announce this publicly because of being stubborn.
You spearhead our national defense and today your power is acknowledged even by your enemies. Many of your enemies even acknowledge your power publicly.
Allah the Exalted says, â€œAgainst them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah.â€ [The Holy Quran, 8: 60] Your preparedness makes the enemy fearful: not fearful of your invasion because you are not aggressive, but fearful of your resistance and of attacking you.
In a world in which reliance on the power of bayonets and weapons can unfortunately play a determining role in the relations between nations and countries, in a world in which there are bullies who decide to take control of the destiny of other nations with iron fists, in a world that is materialistic, only a nation that proves to be prepared for defense will be secure from harm.
Our Armed Forces and the Army of the Islamic Republic proved this.
This is power. This is a source of power for a country.
It is necessary to preserve this preparedness. You should preserve all your material and spiritual assets. During your service and throughout your life, you should safeguard your piety, faith, motivation and spiritual purity as well as your firm determination to defend the country.
We will never start a bloody war. The Iranian nation has proven this. But we are a nation that responds to all kinds of attack and even all kinds of threats with full force and determination.
We are not a nation that stands by and watches the fragile materialist powers â€“ which have been eaten by worms and termites from within â€“ threaten the steadfast and powerful Iranian nation.
We will answer threats with threats.
Anybody who thinks of attacking the Islamic Republic of Iran should be prepared to receive strong slaps and iron fists from the Armed Forces, from the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, from the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and from Basij: all supported by the great Iranian nation.
And America, its regional puppets and its guard dog â€“ the Zionist regime â€“ should know that the response of the Iranian nation to any kind of aggression, attacks or even threats will be a response that will make them collapse from within.
Continue your preparedness to maintain this national and international power.
Everybody should remain prepared to preserve the high values which will be permanent throughout history. Everybody should remain prepared in the arena of knowledge, work, industry, management and politics.
And the Armed Forces spearhead our national defense in the military arena.
We are confident that the greatest kind of deterrence is the firm structure of the Islamic Republic, our national unity and the closeness of the hearts of the Iranian people to each other.
I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow success, good fortune, dignity and glory on all you dear youth, your teachers, your commanders and all those who have played a role in creating this beautiful and glorious reality.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 14, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with basijis of Kermanshah province.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Two Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I have been familiar with Kermanshah and its people since a long time ago. But during the past two, three days, Allah the Exalted gave me another opportunity to meet you dear people of Kermanshah and observe your behavior, which made me respect Kermanshah and its people even more than before.
I am thankful to God who bestowed His grace and guidance on these pure-hearted, pious, sincere and magnanimous people.
Thankfully, the young generation of this region and this province have inherited the same positive and outstanding characteristics that defined the social behavior of their forefathers. More importantly, the revolutionary thought, the revolutionary current, the revolutionary spirit, the revolutionary logic and the revolutionary discourse are alive in this region.
Today's programs were good programs. I would like to thank the esteemed people who planned this meeting.
I seriously ask the youth who are interested in sports and are physically capable to take their skill seriously.
Besides spiritual and intellectual progress and what the Revolution has brought for us - which I will explain briefly later on - our young generation should acquire physical capabilities as well.
Physical health and capabilities are absolutely necessary and beneficial for the men who pursue lofty goals in life and are interested in the spiritual and intellectual aspect of life.
The Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should be considered a branch of the Revolution and the Islamic Republic. And Basij should be considered a unique event among the events of the Revolution.
One of the things that is necessary in every popular movement is to create the necessary terminology and systems on the basis of the fundamental principles of the movement.
When a new idea - such as the idea of Islamic rule or Islamic Awakening - is proposed, it introduces new concepts into society.
Therefore, this movement needs its own terminology.
If terms are borrowed from somewhere else, there will be confusion and it will be impossible to fully clarify the idea.
We believe in democracy and we also believe in freedom, but we do not believe in liberal democracy.
We do not want to use the term for the immaculate, wholesome, righteous and pure concept that we have in mind.
Therefore, we need to select a new name for our favorite system: "Islamic democracy" or "Islamic Republic".
Similarly, we do not want to use the term "socialism" to refer to the concept of equitable distribution of wealth among people, which is one of the lofty and essential goals of Islam.
Although the literal meaning of socialism is equitable distribution of wealth, it is associated with other concepts which we hate.
Over time, socialism has come to be associated with certain things in society that are unacceptable to us.
Therefore, instead of the terms that are common among leftist, Marxist and similar elements, we introduced the terms "arrogance", "imposition of weakness" and "populism". What I mean by "we" is the Revolution and I am not suggesting that particular individuals played an undeniable role in this regard.
The same is true of building systems.
When a revolution or a movement achieves victory, it should create its own executive systems in order to pursue its goals.
One of the things that can be done is to adapt the existing systems in society. Another thing that can be done is to create a system that is appropriate for the new needs. Both are difficult.
The Islamic Revolution did both of these things.
For example, the military which had been built by a different system and different individuals was transformed into a revolutionary and pious army. The structures were changed. The methods were changed.
In the process, a new organization branched off from the military - namely, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps. If the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps had not branched off from the military, it would have been impossible to transform the military.
These were the capacities of the Revolution which our magnanimous Imam utilized by relying on his accurate understanding of the existing and future needs of our society.
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) who proposed the idea of establishing Basij and "an army of twenty million". This massive movement by Basij was one of the miraculous things that the Revolution achieved under the leadership of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
As I said the other day, when a government is established to achieve such lofty ideals as confronting global oppression, international hegemony of superpowers, imposed backwardness and arrogance - ideals which appear to be unattainable - it would naturally make big enemies, and great powers would step in to counter such a government.
Therefore, it is necessary for such a government to prepare itself.
Basij is one of the pillars of such preparedness.
This was why Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that when there are 20 million people in a country who are prepared to put up an armed resistance, no power in the world will think of conquering that country.
Of course, this does not mean that the entire society should be militarized and that everybody should be armed with guns.
It only means that everybody should be prepared for armed defense.
A country in which everybody is prepared for battle would never be defeated.
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) who introduced this innovation. Therefore, in Azar 1358, he ordered the establishment of Basij in the country and he had the same serious attitude towards Basij until the end of his life.
Basij is the school of humble witnesses and martyrs. "Basij is the pure army of God." These are quotations from our magnanimous Imam, which show that he had properly identified the existing and future needs of this country, this nation and this system.
Preparedness for armed defense is something that we will always need, even after 50 years.
The issues that exist today did not exist at that time.
Today Basij is a pioneer in the area of knowledge and innovation.
Towards the end of his life, in a statement written in Azar 1367 - namely, around ten years after he ordered the establishment of Basij - Imam Khomeini (r.a.) demanded that students and seminarians should establish Basij for students of universities and Islamic seminaries.
This shows that the need for the basiji spirit in the country is related to all areas, particularly areas that are related to universities and Islamic seminaries.
Today in our Islamic seminaries, there are great basiji scholars who are proud of being members of Basij.
He used to say that he was proud of being a basiji.
The same is true of universities.
Today in all areas, we have issues that did not exist at that time.
These scientific advances did not exist at that time.
At the beginning of the Revolution, Basij, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and all government officials had focused their attention on safeguarding the existence of the Revolution. They had focused all their attention on protecting the sampling that had just germinated in this country.
In the western, southeastern, northwestern and southwestern parts of the country and in different other areas, the arrogant powers and the enemies of the Revolution, Islam and Iran had given rise to certain events.
At that time, pious and enthusiastic youth would enter the arena and lay down their life with a basiji spirit. Yesterday I mentioned examples of such youth from Kermanshah in the meeting with families of our martyrs.
One month after the Revolution, one would see these popular movements being carried out by the youth of Kermanshah. This is what Basij is.
Basij is a movement that originates from piety, love and self-confidence and it is accompanied by innovation.
It is necessary to introduce innovations in all areas.
For example, I noticed that the performance of Varzesh-e Bastani at the beginning of this meeting was full of innovations. When I was young, I used to watch performances of Varzesh-e Bastani.
Of course, it was not bad. It was actually good, but there were not so many innovations.
It is possible to introduce such innovations in all areas.
There are different kinds of wicked acts in the vast arena of diplomacy.
You can see that diplomacy is the arena of wicked acts.
Of course, thankfully our enemies do not know what to do.
They constantly repeat their mistakes: for example, in the statements that they make in their propaganda.
These things result from the revolutionary spirit which we call the basiji spirit and the spirit of youth, innovation, pioneering action and self-confidence.
The same is true of the economic area, scientific progress and activities related to production.
Therefore, the activities of Basij and the basiji spirit are not limited to a particular area such as military areas. All sectors of the country can have a basiji spirit.
Basiji acquisition of knowledge, basiji accumulation of wealth, basiji diplomacy, basiji politics, basiji management, basiji organization - the concept of Basij can be extended to all these areas. The concept includes innovation and sincerity. Sincerity is the main pillar of basiji work.
Obscure is one of the words that our magnanimous Imam used: "The school of witnesses and obscure martyrs."
Obscurity means refusing to go after fame. They worked for the sake of God, which is due to the spirit of trust in God.
God's angels will not let your worship go unnoticed.
No, your worship will be recorded: "He who has done an atom's weight of good shall see it." [The Holy Quran, 99: 7] The same is true of social activities.
Sometimes you do something or make a decision for the sake of God without anybody knowing. And you do not boast about your decision in front of anybody, but Allah the Exalted sees and records what you do.
When you trust Allah the Exalted, you do not care if other people find out about your good deeds or not.
Compared with divine rewards, what is the value of this material compensation?
This is why a basiji works with sincerity for the sake of God.
All these things result from polytheism, covert polytheism.
When there is sincerity and monotheism, these things will be eliminated.
This is the basiji spirit.
When we say Basij is everywhere, this does not mean we should neglect "the army of twenty million" or "the army of tens of millions" which was introduced after Imam Khomeini (r.a.) had passed away. No, that basiji army is necessary.
Considering the wishes, ideals and ambitions of our nation, it is necessary to be constantly prepared for defense: defense that is accompanied by innovation.
That is to say, our dear youth should be aware and they should move forward in a conscious way. They should know what they are looking for.
In a situation in which truth has been mixed up with falsehood in the world, in a situation in which evil individuals have spread their oppressive and satanic hegemony over the life of human beings, in a situation in which the arrogant powers have dominated the world, there is a nation that speaks the truth, a nation that is after the truth, a nation that is after human rights, a nation that is after establishing justice in this confusion. And this nation is the Iranian nation - thanks to Islam and the Revolution.
The Iranian nation has stood firm.
Because of the resistance of the Iranian nation, this thought has gradually gained ground in the region and in the world although we might only see the effects in the region only.
This is a fact.
It is obvious that the devils of the world will not leave us alone. They will not give up as long as they can fight.
As long as the corrupt and wicked government of the Soviet Union was in power, it was opposed to Islam and the Islamic system, just like the so-called system of liberal democracy. You know that they disagreed about many issues, but there were a few issues that they all agreed on. One of those issues - and the most important one - was confronting Islamic uprisings, Islamic progress and Islamic systems.
However, as long as they exist, they will try their best to counter the Islamic system.
Allah the Exalted is truthful.
One camp is after the truth and the opposing camp is after falsehood. If the righteous camp is afraid, it is clear that it will be defeated: it might be righteous, yet it will be defeated.
If the righteous camp grows impatient, it will be defeated.
Allah the Exalted has not guaranteed victory for the righteous side simply because it is righteous. No, you will achieve victory because you are righteous and because you resist.
If you resist, you will achieve victory.
But until you achieve ultimate victory, the battle and the confrontation will go on.
The Army can have a basiji spirit. The Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps can have a basiji spirit. Basiji units, which have been established on this foundation, can have a basiji spirit.
The diplomatic system of the country can have a basiji spirit.
If these things happen, victory will be definite and swift. This is how we should look at basijis and the basiji spirit, and we should try to strengthen this spirit as much as we can.
In this case, the role of Basij is to rise above the situation and make sure the general path of the Revolution and the Islamic system does not deviate from the right path.
One characteristic of Basij is that it follows a straight path towards the lofty goals of the Islamic Revolution without any deviations.
This is the basiji perspective.
I deem it necessary to point out that Basij - with the characteristics that I mentioned earlier - is committed to the rules and values that were cohesively built into the framework of the Islamic system.
There should be innovation, but not lack of discipline.
Some people make a mistake in this regard.
Of course, if the general identity of Basij - which reveals itself in the framework of the Islamic system, including the Leadership and legislative organizations - perceives a particular regulation as an obstacle, it will change that regulation.
Basij will change that regulation, but this does not mean that Basij gives rise to chaos and lack of discipline. During the war, certain people used to say that Basij moves forward without any limits. They used to say that Basij does not have any brakes.
Their youthful enthusiasm and dynamism would attract them towards the battlefields.
This kind of disagreement was always going on in different parts of the battlefields.
They used to say that Basij does not have any brakes.
This does not mean that Basij lacks discipline.
Discipline is a value. The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) used to tell his children: "I advise you to fear God and organize your affairs."
You should have discipline in your work.
It is discipline that prepares the ground for success.
A military force that lacks discipline is totally useless. The rules that exist in the Armed Forces - the parades, the military formations, the badges, the uniforms and the discipline - are not just observed for the sake of appearances.
This is discipline. Fortunately, today we see that these things are fully observed both in the Army and the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Discipline is a necessity.
If you take discipline away from a military organization or unit, it becomes totally useless.
For example, there are thousands of soldiers in a brigade.
Therefore, discipline is a value and lack of discipline is not.
Anarchy is not a value. Acting according to the law is a value.
Pay attention to this point. This is one side of the issue. Another side of the issue is that it is wrong to resort to certain restrictive regulations in order to derail and isolate innovative movements that originate from the basiji spirit.
On the one hand, it is necessary to avoid chaos and anarchy.
This is part of our view of Basij.
I would tell you that the future of the country is a very bright future.
Contrary to what our enemies have constantly said - and their statements have been repeated by some spiteful and malevolent people inside the country - and contrary to all their propaganda which convinces some naÃ¯ve people, the movement of the Islamic Republic has been a successful movement. This is what our experience shows us.
No, we look at the realities on the ground and see that the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation have made progress over the past 32 years thanks to this system: advances that are far more outstanding that the advances commonly achieved by other nations in the world.
Certain nations are good at management and they have made good achievements, but this movement by the Iranian nation has been more successful than the normal achievements that have been made throughout the world.
This is true of all areas. We have made progress in all areas.
There are certain problems in society.
The fact that we have made progress does not mean there are no problems in the country.
This is true of all areas - political areas, scientific areas and different other areas - which can be inspirational and helpful for the managers who are working for different sectors of the country and the people in charge of large-scale management throughout the country.
Commitment to the values is the most important factor.
Commitment to the principles and values that form the foundation of the Revolution are very important.
It is a fact that at the beginning of the Revolution our youth were highly excited, which was due to the strong sentiments created by the Revolution.
But the sentiments were not always deep. I was in contact with university students at that time, just as I am today.
In Tehran and everywhere else I went, I was faced with questions from our students.
Today the views are far deeper and far more profound than those days and they are based on careful reflection on the principles. There was excitement at that time and there was also a valuable and successful movement in the country.
But today's youth are deeper. Today that revolutionary excitement no longer exists and the enemies are broadcasting a lot of negative propaganda against us, yet this is how our youth are today.
There are some people who close their eyes to all these positive points and they focus their attention on problematic areas. They only see the problems. This is wrong.
What is important is to see whether we are moving towards resolution of these problems or not.
Dear youth, make this view the foundation of your movement.
Try to influence the people around you.
Try to increase this depth.
Fortunately, today the necessary means have been prepared. The writings of Shahid Motahhari and the writings of our outstanding religious scholars and luminaries who are living in Qom, Tehran and other places - these writings contain good points and good teachings.
Try to transform your mind with these teachings and try to promote them among the people around you.
Of course, there is also the spirit of relationship with God.
Try to strengthen your spiritual relationship with Allah the Exalted as much as you can. This is very valuable.
Your youthful view, your sincere worship, your repentance, your divine remembrance, your appeal for divine assistance and your solemn praying are very effective.
Do not forget this.
The gatherings that you arrange for divine remembrance and praying - try to imbue these gatherings with divine understanding.
Dua Kumeyl coupled with an understanding of the relevant concepts, Dua Nudba and whatever else you engage in should be accompanied by divine understanding.
It is necessary to benefit from the good, honorable and intellectual religious scholars of our country.
This movement is a successful movement and by Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will reach and conquer the peaks of global power thanks to the youthful, pious, basiji and innovative spirit that exists in the country. By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will plant the flag of Islam at the peaks.
Thirty years ago, nobody would have thought that Islamic and Quranic slogans would be shouted in countries such as Tunisia and Egypt.
Today these slogans are heard in those countries and by Allah's favor, this wave is spreading throughout the world.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad and his household, bestow Your mercy and blessings on these pure and enlightened hearts.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad and his household, help those of us who are working for different sectors of the country to act the way that satisfies You.
Dear God, punish and suppress the enemies of this nation.
Dear God, prepare the means that are necessary for the Islamic glory, honor and pride of this nation.
Dear God, associate the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam with Your saints.
Leader’s Speech to People of Isfahan - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to welcome you dear brothers and sisters who have traveled this long distance [from Isfahan to Tehran] to imbue the atmosphere of this Hussainiyyah with your faith and emotions on this auspicious Eid.
I would also like to congratulate all you dear audience, the dear people of Isfahan, the entire Iranian nation and all Muslims throughout the world on Eid al-Adha.
The timing of this meeting is very appropriate. The 25th of Aban represents the sacrifices made by the people of Isfahan, and this occasion has coincided with Eid al-Adha this year.
If we pay attention to the philosophy inherent in Eid al-Adha, many paths will be opened up for us.
A select Messenger of the Righteous One, Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.), made a sacrifice on Eid al-Adha. In some cases, sacrificing your loved ones is beyond sacrificing your life. Prophet Ibrahim was about to sacrifice a loved one in the way of God - a young child whom Allah the Exalted had bestowed on him at an old age after a lifetime of waiting.
[The Holy Quran, 14: 39] Allah the Exalted had bestowed these two sons on him at an old age, probably after a lifetime of impatient waiting. He had no hope of getting another child at that age.
The Master of the Martyrs of the entire world, Imam Hussein (a.s.), who is the symbol of sacrifice and martyrdom, remembers this event in the holy prayer of Arafah: "And Ibrahim decided to sacrifice his son at an old age after waiting a lifetime." This is part of a dua by Imam Hussein (a.s.) in Arafah, a dua that was recited by hajjis yesterday.
This sacrifice is a symbol for the faithful people who want to tread the path of truth, transcendence and perfection. This is impossible without a sacrifice.
In fact, all the tests that we go through involve one essential element - all tests involve a sacrifice.
If they go through this hardship, they will reach the desired destination.
And if they fail - if they fail to utilize the talent within them, if they fail to overcome their passions - they will fall by the wayside. This is what a test is. God does not put us through divine tests in order to get to know us and see at what level we are.
When we are tested and we manage to go through the hardships of tests, we enter a new situation, a new stage of life.
A nation and an individual are not different from one another in this regard.
Last year the Iranian nation went through a difficult test.
It went through a fitna. This does not just mean that everybody has realized the Iranian nation is powerful. Rather, what is more important is that our nation entered a new situation after this movement was carried out with this level of capability, the capability to deal with fitna and hardships.
Our nation has now obtained a new capability. During their lifetime, people are tested every step of the way. If we manage to overcome our passions, if we manage to utilize our insight, if we manage to detect the right time, and if we recognize the necessary measures to be taken, we will enter a new stage of life.
Therefore, the 25th of Aban - which is a prominent day and a symbol - has this significance for the people of Isfahan.
I deem it necessary to make a few points about the merits of the people of Isfahan. These things are considered to represent the identity of these faithful, honorable and persistent people.
In one day the people of Isfahan held funeral ceremonies for 370 martyrs without batting an eye, and on the same day they sent soldiers to the battlefields. This is a very important point.
As the Friday prayer leader of Isfahan said, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) praised the people of Isfahan for this move.
In Aban of the year 1361, funeral ceremonies were held for 370 martyrs in one day, and they offered more than one thousand martyrs in the same month.
Over one thousand martyrs!
Who gets martyred?
Those who are in the arena and are exposed to danger - those who are pioneers. Before the Revolution, Isfahan had an outstanding presence in different events. The same is true of the events related to the Revolution as well as the imposed war.
There were military units stationed in Isfahan, whether the units that belonged to the Army of the Guardians of the Revolution - including the Imam Hussein Army headquartered in Isfahan, the Najaf Army headquartered in Najafabad and the Ghamar-e Bani Hashem Brigade - or the units that belonged to the Army, or the artillery center in Isfahan. If you put all these things together, they will become very significant.
You will conclude that in arenas that were important to the country, the people of Isfahan were considered among the pioneers during and after the eight-year imposed war. The same is true of their role in the growth and development of the country and in scientific issues.
Some of the chronic problems of our Armed Forces were resolved in scientific and research centers of Isfahan.
These are sources of pride - not in the sense of self-importance, but in the sense of recognizing one's identity and innate talents and moving forward on the basis of this identity and these talents.
Everybody knows that during the eight-year imposed war the people of Isfahan used to cooperate with different military units fighting at the first lines of defense. This is something that is clear to everybody.
But what is not so clear to many people is the role of obscure and humble people who acted as backup for the soldiers fighting at the front lines all those years - women who used to help from homes, businessmen who used to work at the bazaar, people who were active in bureaucratic organizations and jihadists who used to provide different kinds of services for the war fronts.
There were people among them who were even martyred. There were people among them who were martyred or offered martyrs, and they were humble people whose names have not been registered anywhere.
Not even the smallest things go unaccounted for in divine calculations.
All those aid caravans from Isfahan, all those efforts and all that motivation, yet look at the families of those martyrs.
Surely the friends of God - they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.
No nation will ever achieve anything by sitting around, eating, sleeping, relying on foreigners and letting passions dominate its life.
Some people spin negative yarns when there is a mention of the Sacred Defense, make sarcastic comments when there is a mention of martyrdom, distort their faces when there is a mention of disabled soldiers and war veterans and laugh scornfully when there is a mention of centrifuges for uranium enrichment. They simply shake their heads and say, "It is impossible." These people do not understand anything about the movement of a nation.
Those who have been trained in a wrong way and according to corrupt satanic ethics do not understand anything about the effect of faith and jihad.
When a nation comes to believe in jihad, it becomes a pioneer in all arenas.
Jihad is not just limited to holding a rifle in your hand. Jihad means that one should see oneself in the arena of action and fight against the obstacles and those who create them.
This is Islamic jihad. Jihad may be carried out by laying down one's life. It may also be carried out through one's wealth, thought, shouting slogans, taking to the streets and going to the ballot boxes.
This is jihad in the way of Allah, and it is what helps a nation grow, make progress and become dynamic, revitalized and hopeful.
How can it go about this fight?
It is not possible to fight it through war - they tried this and saw the result. It is not possible to fight it through war and military threats.
Those who think that they can bring the Iranian nation to its knees through sanctions are just wasting their time.
When a nation has hope and faith and knows what it is doing, it cannot be forced to retreat through the use of threats.
In order to fight such a nation, they will pay attention to the point that you mentioned [refers to a slogan shouted by the audience], which is indicative of the vigilance of you dear people of Isfahan: Creating a rift in the nation, turning the people against one another, creating a gap between the people and government officials, and causing suspicion and disagreement over trivial issues.
This is one of the most important forms of enmity utilized by the enemies of the Islamic Revolution.
Of course the people of Isfahan have been vigilant.
Everybody should guard against creation of division, fitna and suspicion of the system. You see some people leveling accusations against the Islamic Republic here and there with no regard for any considerations or principles. They act as the enemy's representatives and say whatever they like because if the propaganda machines of the anti-Islam, Zionist and American camp could not make themselves heard, they want to be able to make up for it and deliver their message to people.
These people are betraying the nation. This is in fact a clear betrayal. Making the people suspect each other and the hardworking government officials and creating an atmosphere of despair - these are one of the methods.
Another method is to promote moral corruption in society.
Everybody, especially our youth, should be extremely vigilant.
Unfortunately moral corruption and moral degeneration are used as a means to further the political goals of the arrogant powers. In order to weaken and annihilate a nation - and of course to obtain money in the process - they use drugs as means to further their political goals in many parts of the world.
Our nation, our youth and our government officials should be extremely careful about these things.
Isfahan enjoys highly prominent capacities, just as it did in the past. You should appreciate these capacities.
Isfahan is the center of knowledge - religious knowledge and different other types of knowledge. It used to be the center of knowledge in the past as well.
Fortunately Isfahan has a good Islamic seminary today.
It behooves the ulama, scholars and researchers of Isfahan to set their sights on the glory that Isfahan used to enjoy during the past centuries.
One day Isfahan was the center of scientific brilliance in the entire country and even in the entire world of Islam. You should be after such a position.
Isfahan is also prominent in artistic areas, fine arts and handicrafts.
Each of these things is an advantage.
And the religious faith and beliefs of the people of Isfahan is the supporting foundation of all these things. This has been manifested in the behavior of the people of Isfahan since before the Revolution, but after the Revolution everything acquired new dimensions.
I used to visit Isfahan a lot at that time. I was witness to the religious situation of the people and their commitment to religious matters.
Therefore, this religious faith is a great support.
When a nation enjoys faith, it feels that nothing it does is ever futile.
By Allah's favor, today the Iranian nation has managed to successfully confront different kinds of hostilities.
In today's world, the basis of the enmity of the anti-Islam camp towards the Islamic Republic is the faith of this government, this Republic and this nation in divine values. Materialistic leaders cannot tolerate this.
This is one side of the issue. The other side of the issue is that the progressive movement of the Iranian nation during the past 32 years was all because of divine faith and devotion to these values.
You should know that this progress will continue.
Dear God, bestow Your mercy, grace and assistance on this nation and on the dear people of Isfahan.
Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us, and make us benefit from his prayers.
Leader's Speech to Exemplary Nurses - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 21, 2010 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to a large number of exemplary nurses from across the country.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters as well as all the esteemed nurses of the country on the occasion of Nurse Day and the birthday anniversary of Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.).
I hope as a reward for your great services and precious efforts, Allah the Exalted will bestow His grace and guidance on all you dear nurses and all health professionals of the country.
The main purpose of today's meeting is to thank our nurses for their efforts.
Health issues are among the most important issues in human communities.
There are two blessings whose value is not appreciated: Health and security. There is indeed an essential point in this famous hadith.
Both health and security are among the blessings that cannot be properly appreciated before they are taken away - just like the air we breathe.
As long as you can breathe easily, you will not understand the importance of this free and plentiful blessing. But when breathing becomes difficult, you will know what a great blessing you have lost.
In fact, this great blessing is provided for society by the health and nursing profession.
And nurses have a very prominent role in this regard.
Nurses are constantly faced with a spiritual and psychological challenge. They are not just faced with a physical challenge. It is very difficult to see the sufferings of patients and feel duty-bound to provide physical and spiritual treatment for them.
I assure you that you will receive a reward from Allah the Exalted for every moment of your work and your sense of responsibility to the patients who are in pain.
Not even a single moment will go unrewarded.
One should not think that the painful moments that a nurse spends at the bedside of a patient will not be noticed by God.
Every moment of your work and every effort you make deserve a divine reward. Every time you exercise patience in the face of the hardships will be recorded by Allah the Exalted.
It is necessary to appreciate these challenging duties which have crucial implications for society.
It is necessary to pay attention to these obligations as well.
Your patients have emotions and a soul, and they need compassion, especially when they are in pain. They need to be treated kindly.
Sometimes a simple smile is more effective than the medicine you give them.
This is in the hands of nurses.
They will receive great rewards for their work, but the duty they have to shoulder is very difficult.
The balance between one's rights and obligations is one of the greatest tenets of Islamic thought.
The esteemed Minister spoke about in-service training, which is a very valuable thing to do. It would be appropriate if in-service courses could provide professional as well as ethical training for our nurses. It is indeed necessary to prepare a charter of ethics for our nurses, and it should be taught to them so that they realize the importance of their work and do their job appropriately.
I wish you success. In the Islamic Republic, Nurse Day has been chosen to coincide with Zeinab al-Kubra's (s.a.) birthday anniversary.
Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.) is a prominent role model in history and shows the significance of a woman's presence in one of the most important events in human history.
Blood gained a victory over the sword on the day of Ashura, and Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.) was the cause of that victory.
This was because the forces of righteousness were apparently defeated in a military fight in Karbala, but Zeinab al-Kubra's (s.a.) behavior was the factor that turned this apparent defeat into a permanent and decisive victory. That victory was due to the role she played after the day of Ashura. That is a very important point.
The event proved that women are not on the periphery of history. It proved that women can have a central role in important historical events.
She proved that it is possible to turn feminine morality and modesty into glory and a great jihad.
The greatness of Zeinab al-Kubra's (s.a.) movement is reflected in what is left of her sermons.
It was not just the personal opinion of an important figure.

She said, You could not distinguish between right and wrong in the fitna. You were unable to fulfill your duty. As a result, they severed the head of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) grandson and put it on a spear."
This is a warning to our women to identify their role. They should understand the greatness of being a woman by combining feminine modesty and morality with pious dignity.
That is how faithful Muslim women are. The corrupt western world tried to impose its wrong and misguided redefinition of women on the people of the world - which was degrading to women.
They tried to convince the world that in order to develop a personality, women have to look attractive to men.
Is this humiliation or respect?
And some people were taken in. The greatness of women does not depend on their ability to attract the attention of immoral men.
Therefore, the Holy Quran mentions the names of two women as examples of religious faith for both men and women. "And God sets forth, as an example to those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh" [The Holy Quran, 66: 11]. "And Mary the daughter of Imran" [The Holy Quran, 66: 12].God mentions the wife of Pharaoh and Mary as two examples of faith.
These are some signs that point to an underlying Islamic ideology.
Our Revolution is based on the characteristics of Zeinab al-Kubra.
Since the beginning of the Revolution, women have played a very prominent role in the course of the Revolution.
A mother - who has spent about 20 years of her life to raise a child with her motherly love - sends her young child to the battlefield, and she is not even sure whether the body will be returned to her.
Is this comparable to the sacrifice made by her young child who volunteers to go to the battlefield?
And when her child's body is returned to her, she feels proud that her child has been martyred.
Is this something insignificant?
There were many such cases during our Revolution.
Dear brothers and sisters, this was how our Revolution continued.
The power and glory of this Revolution is due to fascination with spirituality and divine blessings.
When the enemy triumphantly asked Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.) to describe what she had seen, she said, "I did not see anything but beauty."
Her brothers, her children, her dear ones, her closest companions, and many others had been violently killed in front of her eyes. She had seen the enemy put their heads on spears, but she said, "I did not see anything but beauty."
Now try to combine this beauty with the narration according to which Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.) did not fail to say her midnight prayers even on the eleventh day of Muharram [the day after Ashura].
Her relationship with Allah the Exalted was not undermined during her captivity. On the contrary, her relationship with God was strengthened.
She is a role model.
Today the Iranian nation is known as an inspiring nation among Muslim nations.
Of course the enemies do not like this, and they try to deny this fact. But that is the truth.
The power of this nation does not depend on missiles, cannons, tanks, warplanes, and other military weapons. Of course these weapons are also necessary, and we thankfully have them, but the power of this nation is due to its faith.
Thanks to God's grace, guidance, and assistance, our nation has managed to make quantum leaps in various fields.
And the facilities that we currently have at our disposal are not comparable to the facilities we used to have at the beginning of the Revolution - or before the Revolution for that matter. Nor are our facilities comparable to many of the countries that did not have to deal with the difficulties we have faced - the countries that have pinned their hopes on the assistance of foreigners and their enemies.
By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation has made a lot of progress in these areas as well, but these factors are not the source of our power.
The existence or lack of material facilities does not make a difference for an Islamic nation.
But our nation has been making increasing progress on a daily basis.
Therefore, the greatness of the Iranian nation is due to its faith.
Now there are some dim-witted people who are threatening the Iranian nation!
The US President implicitly threatened us with a nuclear attack last week.
Such threats will not affect the Iranian nation.
It revealed what lies behind the hand of friendship extended towards the Iranian nation. Their fox-like rhetoric became wolfish. Until now they were saying that they were willing to extend a hand of friendship.
It revealed the intentions of their bloodthirsty and domineering nature.
They want to use their nuclear power as a means to dominate the world.
This is true of all nuclear powers.
They are blatant liars.
But then they start finding fault with other nations and complain that they have failed to conform to a particular part of the treaties.
That is the problem.
We have transparent nuclear policies. We have repeatedly said before that we are not the kind of people to use destructive nuclear weapons.
The Iranian nation will bring them to their knees in spite of their claims. International communities must not pass over the American President's threat.
Why are they threatening another country with a nuclear attack?
Why are they threatening the world with destruction?
No one should be allowed to make such threats against humanity.
Even uttering such threats is unacceptable - even if they announce they did not mean it, even if they admit it was a mistake.
The world cannot afford to pass over the statements that pose a threat to global peace and security.
Of course the Iranian nation will not be affected by such statements.
They cannot force the Iranian nation to retreat through such things.
We will not allow the Americans to re-establish their infernal hegemony over our country through such means.
The Iranian nation will not allow this.
The Iranian nation will not allow such things. By Allah's grace, we will make progress in all areas despite the enemies' will.
Our youth are making efforts.
By Allah's favor, the increasing faith of our youth and the increasing insight of our nation will overcome these threats as well as the plots that are hatched with the aim of creating chaos in the country - including the plots similar to what we saw in the year 1388.
Our nation has insight. Our nation is faithful.
I hope Allah the Exalted will increase this insight on a daily basis because of the pure prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Hopefully, you dear youth will see the glory and development of your country in the near future.
Allah's grace be upon the immaculate souls of our magnanimous Imam and our martyrs.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of you.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 13, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the Armed Forces of Kermanshah province.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I salute all the dear commanders, every one of the military units that are present on this parade ground and all selfless and brave members of the Armed Forces of Kermanshah province - including the Army, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, Basij and the Police. I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow increasing blessings on all of you.
This military base and this region evoke extraordinary memories for me.
Brave and selfless men and the people whose hearts were full of love for Islam and dear Iran, made many sacrifices in this region.
Relying on divine blessings and assistance, they managed to defeat the armed enemy - who had been approved by the satans - and they managed to bring about pride, honor, dignity and immunity for their country.
We will not forget the memory of those days.
Those days are a lesson for us and we have always been hopeful that in different organizations the preparedness, faith and determination of our dear youth and Armed Forces will increase.
Among those who serve Islam and the country, the Armed Forces enjoy certain advantages. First of all, they safeguard our security.
If security was taken away from a nation, all paths of progress would be closed to that nation.
Security is an essential and vital requirement for all affairs.
Knowledge, progress, technology, wealth and spirituality will only be achieved under the shade of security.
The Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran are the guardians of security. They believe it is the duty to safeguard the security at our borders and inside the country and this is a great advantage.
The second advantage that the Armed Forces enjoy is that they lay down their lives in the arena of rendering services.
Our youth and the commanders and members of the Armed Forces prepare themselves for self-sacrifice with enthusiasm and they enter the arena of rendering services.
This is the nature of their Islamic faith.
In our Armed Forces, there is no imposition. There is no pressure.
Materialistic powers have to deal with the problem that their soldiers are a nervous wreck in different parts of the world, but the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoy the advantage that their members enter the arena motivated by religious faith.
This is a great advantage.
My dear ones, the Islamic Republic, the great Iranian nation, our dear country has proven over the past three decades that its power is increasing on a daily basis.
The eight-year war that was imposed on our country and our people showed everybody that attacking the Islamic Republic is expensive.
The defeat of the army that had attacked our country was in fact a major defeat for the armed forces of the global powers and their satanic policies.
They realized who they were fighting: the Islamic Republic.
The brave people of our country have always supported our Armed Forces.
Allah the Exalted is helping you: He has made the hearts of the people kind towards you.
Today the Armed Forces are regarded with respect among the people.
These are great advantages.
Dear brothers, dear youth and honorable commanders, the duty that our nation is shouldering today is a great and sensitive duty.
Today there are many opportunities lying in front of us.
The arrogant powers are trying to promote Iranophobia and Islamophobia in the world through different policies.
You see the different actions that they take.
They have repeatedly used silly and idiotic methods to promote Iranophobia and Islamophobia and the futility of these methods have been proven, but desperate western politicians continue using these methods.
They have not been able to realize their satanic goal.
Yet they repeat these policies and they will be kicked in the mouth again.
They continue trying old methods and they will continue experiencing the bitter taste of defeat.
Today the arrogant US regime is faced with serious problems.
The American regime cannot get out of the quagmire that it has created in Afghanistan because it does not know how to do so.
They cannot save themselves.
In a world in which people have awakened, it is not possible to solve one's problems with materialistic methods and perspectives. It is not possible to solve one's problems with an aggressive spirit and behaving as if that the world owes you. It is possible to do so only through logic, rationality and spirituality and this is the same method that the Islamic Republic of Iran has adopted.
Allah the Exalted will help you.
According to the Quranic verses which were recited at the beginning of this meeting, "(As for) those who say: Our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not, nor be grieved." [The Holy Quran, 41: 30] Do not fear and do not be sad because God is with you.
We are your guardians in this world's life and in the hereafter. [The Holy Quran, 41: 30] God's angels are your guardians even in this world.
Dear God, associate the souls of our martyrs with Your saints and with the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the martyrs of Karbala.
Leader's Speech in Meeting with MPs of Religious Minorities - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
We have learned from Islam that we should behave in a fair way towards the followers of other religions. This is Islam's command to us.
Today, what is witnessed in the world is that powers and those governments which claim to support justice do not at all behave in a fair way except in the inner circle of their narrow, limited and oppressive polices.
Today, you can see that in Europe and America, they use massive propaganda against Muslims.
The issue is not why Muslims do not have any freedom in many of these countries. Rather, the issue is why they do not have any security.
This is really the case.
The movie "American Sniper", which has produced some reactions and which has been made by Hollywood, encourages a Christian or non-Muslim to harass Muslims as much as he can.
This is not at all accepted by Islam.
Islam believes in justice.
On the issue of that attack [on the city of al-Anbar] the Commander of the Faithful (peace and greetings be upon him) said, "I have come to know that every one of them entered upon Muslim women and muahida women" [Nahjul Balaghah, Sermon 27]. In this sermon, he says that some people have entered the houses of Muslim and muahida women - muahid means Jewish and Christian individuals who have formed an alliance with Muslims and who live under the protection of Islam - to take away their ornaments and harass them.
Then, Hazrat says, "If any Muslim dies of grief after all this, he is not to be blamed".
This is the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.).
If a Muslim dies of grief at the harassment of non-Muslim women by the army of the enemies and looters - they entered their houses and took away their ornaments - he is not to be blamed.
This is the viewpoint of Islam.
We hope that by Allah's favor, we move forward in this direction.
And we have good memories in this regard.
Whenever I go to the houses of Armenian and Assyrian martyrs - this year too, I fortunately managed to visit the houses of a number of Armenian martyrs - I see that they are committed to their country. They have really behaved in a committed way.
I remember that during the time of war, a number of Armenian Christians went to Ahwaz. I saw that a number of people were sitting inside the airport.
I asked, "Who are these people?" they said, "They are Armenians and they are going to the front lines for industrial affairs. They have come to render services".
The late Chamran employed them.
They made efforts, they rendered services and some of them were martyred.
One of the members of an Armenian family whom I visited last week had a son in the army. He said, "When his military service was over, he was unhappy because the war was continuing.
He said, 'My military service is over. What should I do now?'
Later on, it was announced that those who have done their military service for a few months should join the army again.
He became happy at this call-up and he joined the front lines.
Later on, he was martyred and his body was brought to us".
We can witness such nationalistic feelings among our non-Muslim compatriots.
Well, they made efforts and we hope that the Islamic government can carry out its responsibility in this regard.
They really behaved in a committed - in the real sense of the word - way towards the country. You should reflect - outside the country - the courses of action that the Islamic Republic takes in this regard.
People and the world of Christianity should know that in our Islamic country, there is a lot of tolerance and respect for non-Muslims. This is while such tolerance does not exist in the Christian world.
You have heard a lot that in western countries such as Germany, neo-Nazi youth - they are proud of being Nazis and they have called themselves, "neo-Nazis" - attack Muslims and their mosques.
They kill Muslims in a brutal way and there is no legal prosecution.
Another example is that they killed a young Arab woman who was wearing maqna'a or pooshiah [veil] because of her hijab and no one arrests them.
The same is true of other places. The same crimes are unfortunately being committed in America and other places and countries.
This is while they claim to support human rights.
They should compare these with what is happening in Iran.
Such acts are unheard of in Iran. In the Islamic era and in the Islamic Republic, harassing non-Muslims by Muslims is unheard of.
Even those hezbollahi youth who are very zealous and enthusiastic do not allow themselves to attack a non-Muslim.
I hope that Allah the Exalted gives you and us the blessing to carry out our responsibilities.
Leader’s Message of Condolence on Kurdistan Terrorist Attacks - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
And whoever is slain unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority [The Holy Quran, 17: 33].
I received the sad news that the criminal and sinful hands of the arrogant powers' mercenaries have shed the blood of the Mujahid Islamic scholar and the committed clergyman, Mr. Mamousta Sheikholeslam - who was a member of the Assembly of Experts - and that this honorable and obliging man has been martyred at the hands of the soldiers of injustice after decades of unequivocal support for justice.
During the past few days, some other important clergymen, particularly the interim Friday prayer leader of Sanandaj and two honorable judiciary officials of Kurdistan province, were martyred or wounded before the martyrdom of this honorable man.
This series of cruelty and bloodshed in the holy month of Ramadan and on the eve of Quds Day shows that in spite of their claims of religious fervor, these criminals not only desecrate Allah's city but also target what the arrogant powers and some disgraceful governments of the region are determined to attack.
From the perspective of these criminal mercenaries and their Pharaoh-like and Korah-like masters, the unpardonable crime of those who were wounded and martyred in Kurdistan was their commitment to the Islamic Republic, their support for Islamic ideals, and their stance on the issue of the holy city of Jerusalem.
In the month of Ordibehesht, after the mellifluous sound of Islamic unity resonated more than ever before in Kurdistan province, the camp of arrogance and tyranny was determined to take revenge on the noble and oppressed people of that province.
For those brutal enemies, Kurds, Persians, Shias, and Sunnis are not different. Their spiteful and evil hearts would even let them cruelly oppress an old clergyman like the innocent martyr, Mamousta Sheikholeslam.
May the curses of God, the Prophet, and believers be upon those bloodthirsty people and the main centers that support and organize them.
The dear people of Kurdistan should identify their enemies perceptively, and the security officials of the province should place cracking down on these muharib murderers at the top of their agenda.
I express my condolences to the people of Kurdistan province, especially the bereaved families and also congratulate them on the martyrdom of these people. I also pay homage to the memory of those honorable martyrs, especially the dear martyr Mr. Mamousta Sheikholeslam.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Leader’s Speech to Army Commanders - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 22, 2012 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with Ground Force commanders of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Today has been an enjoyable and pleasant day for me: being in the company of you dear brothers and youth from the Armed Forces, speaking to you in person and benefiting from the manifestations of your motivation and dynamism and from your pure and enlightened hearts.
I extend my congratulations to you on the occasion of Army Day.
I hope that each and every one of you - who are mostly young and are going through the good part of your life - will protect the future, dignity, glory and power of our nation in a perfect way.
I hope Allah the Exalted makes this happen.
Thankfully the Ground Forces of the Army have been thriving. One can feel this.
This movement and this auspicious trend started from the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic.
It is wrong to think that during the time of the taghuti regime, there were no pious people in the Army or that there were few such people.
No, this was not the case.
I had seen them on different occasions and in different places.
However, individual orientations and organizational orientations have different meanings. When the orientation of a society or organization is wrong, individual efforts will not be effective in that society, no matter how strenuous they are.
This was the case at that time too.
There is a narration - which I think is from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) - and it contains a qudsi narration: "I will punish any group of Muslims who follow an oppressive ruler who has not been sanctioned by God even if they are pious and do good deeds."
This is what the narration means: if a society is ruled by corrupt and oppressive individuals, pious deeds of the members of that society will not get them anywhere and if some people surrender to those oppressive individuals and follow them, God will punish them. The opposite situation has also been mentioned in the same narration: "And I will forgive any group of Muslims who follow a ruler who guides them under God's order even if they are oppressive and commit sins."
Of course, the narration needs explanation and one should not limit oneself to the apparent meaning, but it essentially means: if in a system, a community, a country or a society, the system of government is divine and just, those who follow the government will be forgiven by God even if they make certain mistakes.
This can be applied to a country, Ummah or society.
Similarly it can be applied to an organization such as the Army. At that time the Army was in the wrong hands. But when the popular movement started, the pious members - and the few high-ranking commanders who were pious - found their path.
Since the early days after the victory of the Revolution, certain people stepped in and helped the revolutionary elements to find a way to speak to the Army.
After all, they were not familiar with each other. Neither our officials, nor the revolutionaries, nor the activists, nor the clergy, nor our academia were familiar with the Army.
This common language was created thanks to the Revolution.
Today the Army is one of the most populist organizations in the country.
Among the different organizations that make up the government, we see that the Army is one of the organizations that has come closest to the people and their tendencies and feelings and that it has contributed most to the popular movement in our society.
This is a very valuable and precious thing.
It is a fact that throughout the world, armies are established and deployed with the slogan of safeguarding national interests, but is this really the case?
Did the US Army safeguard the interests of the American people in Iraq and Afghanistan?
Did the people of America benefit from the occupation of Afghanistan?
Were they happy about killing the people of Afghanistan?
Were the interests of America served by the mercenary soldiers who shot the people, dismembered their bodies and took pictures with the body parts?
If somebody asks the leaders of the US regime why they need the big army and the advanced military equipment, their answer would be: we need them to protect our national interests.
This is the case with almost every part of the world.
Of course, I am not claiming that this is definitely the case everywhere because I do not have all the necessary information. The situation might be different in a particular corner of the world.
But based on what we have seen and learnt, this is often the case throughout the world: armies are established in the name of national interests, but they are not at the service of national interests, rather they are at the service of political ambitions.
This has been the case throughout the history of mankind.
A man deploys more than a million soldiers to go and occupy Greece, but he is defeated and is forced to return to the country. This was an achievement of our taghuti past, during the time of Xerxes.
As far as I know and on the basis of what has been recorded in history books and what is available to us, this has often been the case with armies throughout history: they have either been at the service of personal ambitions or at the service of safeguarding taghuti powers.
During the early years after the victory of the Revolution, part of the Army had been stationed in a royal palace in order to protect it.
A notice had been put up at the palace which said something along the lines of "basically the Army has been established to protect this government" which is very different from protecting national interests.
If we find an army in the world whose beliefs and feelings are the same as those of the people, an army which is truly at the service of the people and national interests rather than at the service of certain individuals, that army is a very valuable army.
And you are such an army.
I really do not know of another example.
As for the countries that have recently carried out a revolution, we should wait and see what happens, but currently I do not know of any such army, an army that is not at the service of personal ambitions, an army that would not fight to death for the sake of a particular person.
I would like to stress that neither God nor Islamic principles would allow us to order our Army, our Armed Forces or our men to fight to death for the sake of a particular person.
Yes, everybody may fight to death for the sake of Islam.
For the sake of raising the flag of our independence as an Islamic country, everybody must be ready to fight to death and this death is called martyrdom.
Then our Army would be a divine and spiritual army. It would be an Islamic army, an example of the "immaculate tree" that I have discussed previously.
This has been the goal since the beginning of the Revolution.
And I would tell you that fortunately we have been moving closer to this goal.
I have been witness to the growth of the Army over the past thirty years.
I was present when we first celebrated the 29th of Farvardin.
In the year 1358, when our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) had been hospitalized, a temporary platform was built in front of the hospital and a few units of the Army paraded past the platform and Imam Khomeini (r.a.) announced the day as Army Day.
Among the people who are present in this meeting - those who have been in the Army in the past thirty years - maybe there is not even one person whose graduation ceremony was held in my absence.
I think I was present in the graduation ceremonies of each and every one of you, those of you who graduated from our military academies and were awarded epaulets. I see that today our Army is more advanced than 20, 15 years ago. It is much more advanced compared to the beginning of the Revolution.
We have made good progress and it is necessary to maintain it.
This progress will bring about happiness in this world and in the hereafter.
Today a movement has started in the world and everybody has realized that the movement is opposed to the system of hegemony.
We do not have a problem with individuals, no matter in which part of the world they live. The issue is the system of hegemony.
What is the system of hegemony?
It is the mechanism in the world according to which countries and nations are categorized into two groups: the domineering and the dominated.
Some of the evil hegemons are denying this and they do not announce it.
But there are some others who announce this because of their stupidity.
One example is the previous US President who openly announced that in the case of Afghanistan, the Twin Towers and other such issues, those who are not with America are against it.
Well, this is stupidity.
The hegemons of the world build their relations with the world on the basis of domination.
The problem that the powerful hegemons of the world are faced with is that there is a movement in the world that is opposed to this mechanism and Islamic Iran is at the epicenter of this movement.
You are at the epicenter of this movement. Islamic Iran has been very patient in this regard. The day when we started the movement, we did not receive any response from any part of the world.
We thought that certain nations would soon join the movement, but that did not happen.
After the passage of years, this thought seeped into the bodies and minds of nations. They gradually changed until a capacity was created.
This is the case with all historical movements.
They are gradual, but they need a spark. Then a single event might trigger a movement, releasing the energy that has accumulated over time, just like what happened in Egypt or certain other places.
It took us thirty years to reach this point.
Therefore, this movement is an important movement.
The colonialists and superpowers are afraid of this movement in the real sense of the word.
These threats, sanctions, conflicts and other such things are all caused by fear.
I am not claiming that they are afraid of the Islamic Republic, especially as a government or as an army.
This is not the issue.
They are afraid of this unprecedented phenomenon that is completely unknown to them.
And it is in our country that the movement is being strengthened on a daily basis. They are afraid of our pious youth, our determined youth and our national sentiments which are accompanied by good - if not perfect - understanding.
You are part of this sensitive and important organization. The Armed Forces are sensitive and important. You should continue like this.
During the early years after the victory of the Revolution, the commander came to me and made an accurate point that I liked very much. It stuck in my mind.
He said, "There is an element of leadership in command."
You are the future commanders of the Ground Forces and the Army and you should improve your leadership qualities.
Command means issuing a set of orders, telling people what to do and what not to do. Leadership means showing the standards that would take the place of those orders, giving rise to a movement without having to order people what to do and what not to do, a movement that originates from the heart.
Instead of establishing a relationship with bodies, it is necessary to establish a relationship with hearts. You should create and strengthen this capacity in yourselves, in which case your country and nation will definitely achieve victory.
That is to say, these feelings and this state of mind will prove helpful in difficult times.
I have seen certain examples in this regard.
Certain people - such as Shahid Sayyad Shirazi and Shahid Babai - are very famous and everybody knows them: those who were present from the beginning to the end of the war and were finally martyred.
But I have met many such people in the Armed Forces during the war, both on the front line and in the meetings that used to be held behind the front line in order to make decisions.
Often the courageous actions that are carried out on the front line originate from the determination and willpower that is mainly shaped behind the front line. If the determination is sincere and if it can make its way to the front line, then those courageous actions take place on the front line.
In any case the Ground Forces are important.
Genuine preparedness consists of religious faith, motivation, training, military knowledge, the necessary expertise, being on standby and firmness of character.
One's ethical and behavioral character should be so strong that different temptations cannot affect it. Sometimes certain temptations might affect and overwhelm people. There are some people who are humiliated for the sake of money, social position and carnal desires.
The most honorable and powerful people are those who refuse to give in to temptation.
Of course, this does not mean that we should turn our backs on the attractions of life.
It is necessary to have the power to resist and to exercise self-restraint, which makes you prepared.
There are many things that I would like discuss with you dear friends, brothers and youth, but there is not enough time. I hope Allah the Exalted bestows success on you.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on these people.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on the Iranian nation.
Dear God, make the bond of kindness, brotherhood, friendship and closeness stronger among different organizations of the Armed Forces, including the Army, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, Basij and the Police Force.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, help us be among the servants about whom You have said, "Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Allah."
[The Holy Quran, 5: 119] Dear God, help us be among the servants whom You have promised to protect and support.
Dear God, make us benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) and fulfill his prayers that are related to us.

Leader’s Speech to Thousands of Basijis from Qom Province - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Greetings be upon you Fatima Masoumeh, our master, the daughter of Musa ibn Ja'far.
Greeting of Allah and His angels and chosen servants be upon you and your immaculate ancestors.
The gathering of the dear basijis - who enjoy warm and enlightened hearts and firm determination - in this holy center in the presence of the holy soul of the great and pure lady, the daughter of Musa ibn Ja'far, is a sign and a flag to demonstrate the grandeur and progressiveness of the Islamic Republic.
The mere presence of millions of enthusiastic, faithful, sincere and insightful youth from across the country in the Basij is enough to prove that this government is dynamic, purposeful, determined and progressive. This presence is enough to show that this government and this great movement by the Iranian nation are immune to the most complex plots and the most dangerous moves of the enemy.
Of course this is not a slogan - it is based on logical reasoning.
The idea to establish the Basij was a sign of divine power which was bestowed on that righteous servant of God, that great man and that unique figure in the history of Islam after the infallible Imams (a.s.). The idea to establish the Basij was proposed and practiced by our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
He stood up for this idea with all his power. He took care of this sapling until is became an immaculate tree which yields "its fruit in every season by the permission of its Lord". [The Holy Quran, 14: 25] The idea to establish the Basij was one of the blessings that God bestowed on that great man and that righteous and humble servant of God.
The Imam's insightful eyes saw these signs of divine power.
The problem with us is that we sometimes feel divine assistance but fail to see it appropriately.
We fail to realize what great assistance is being bestowed on us. But the Imam saw that sign.
I have told this anecdote many times before.
The Imam's outlook on the Iranian nation was different from those of others.
If we had decided to ask many religious and non-religious scientific elites to evaluate the Iranian nation at that time, we would have received weird evaluations. Some people did not consider this nation as faithful.
Yet others had doubts about the power and loyalty of the people. I heard these things from many people. But in the year 1341, when there was no sign of massive public demonstrations, the Imam said in the city of Qom that the people would gather all over the plain around Qom and pledge their allegiance to him if he just asked them to.
This was what he thought of the people.
He knew the people. He discovered the valuable element in the hearts and souls of the people and made use of it.
Therefore, the Islamic Revolution achieved victory in spite of the obstacles on its way.
No analyst could believe such an event would take place in Iran. He trusted God and took action. He formed a bond with the hearts of the people and encouraged them to step into the arena.
You are the sweet fruits of that immaculate tree which was planted in this land by the Imam himself. The tree will continue producing fruits. "Have you not considered how Allah sets forth a parable of a good word (being) like an immaculate tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are in heaven, yielding its fruit in every season by the permission of its Lord?
[The Holy Quran, 14: 24-25] When the land is fertile and prepared and when the seed is pure, the tree will never stop growing.
That is to say, nothing will be able to harm it.
The Basij is such an immaculate tree.
During the Sacred Defense Era, the young generation before you made a lot of achievements in the battlefield.
The Basij played its role during the Sacred Defense Era.
Both the Army and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution admitted that the Basij played a determining role in different stages of the long and difficult battle.
The Basij is present wherever there are selfless efforts - selfless efforts in the arena of knowledge, selfless efforts in the arena of politics, selfless efforts in the arena of social activities, selfless efforts in the vast international arena.
Basij means joining faith and action together - not just action, but selfless action.
From an Islamic perspective, faith without action is the minimum requirement.
Perfect and genuine faith is one that is accompanied by jihad in the arena of action.
Those who believed and left their homes and struggled for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. [The Holy Quran, 8: 74] A true believer is one whose faith is accompanied by jihad and assistance for other believers.
This and many other Quranic verses reject the wrong and misguided idea that faith minus action and jihad is enough to get close to God.
The Basij is based on the idea that faith must be accompanied by action - selfless action.
Therefore, there are various arenas for jihad.
The progress of the Basij in various dimensions is the kind of progress that is expected by anybody who is familiar with the Basij.
The Basij has emerged victorious out of all the tests it has faced.
A dignified man is honorable and trustworthy, but he cannot be the standard for truth.
Sometimes dignified men - like some companions of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) - make a mistake and follow the wrong path.
It is necessary to identify the truth. It is necessary to identify the path in order to be able to tell if somebody is righteous or not.
Whoever treads the right path is righteous, and whoever does not tread the right path should be rejected.
It is necessary to identify the truth.
The young and faithful people who have gathered under the flag of the Basij showed that they enjoy this insight. They showed that they are insightful.
Insight is the first element, and it should remain so in the future.
It is necessary to develop the ability to think critically.
As the founder of this great movement to whom our society owes a debt of gratitude, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said, "If I strayed away from Islam, the people would turn their back on me."
Therefore, insight is the first element, and it should not be forgotten.
Sincerity is the second element.
According to a narration, if somebody who is fighting for a divine cause goes after the spoils of war and gets killed as a result, he has not been martyred in the way of God.
Following the divine path for the sake of God is the requirement for being considered a martyr and mujahid. That is to say, a martyr should have sincerity.
If our movement is affected by our personal or familial motives and our friendships, then this sincerity becomes impure and leads to certain problems.
Lack of sincerity shows its effects one way or another.
Timely and proportional action is the third element.
If one does not know when to do what, one may make big mistakes.
A basiji is one who makes these efforts.
When making these efforts, it is necessary to keep the clear and appropriate path in mind - namely, the path of the Revolution, the path of safeguarding the Islamic Republic, the path of reviving religion.
If we want to take care of these three elements, we need to engage in a jihad against our inner self.
Jihad against our inner selves is what we all need today.
One of the main requirements for developing an appropriate understanding of events is to see what path the enemy is pursuing.
Today distorting realities and different events is one of the main paths that the enemy is pursuing, and this is among the important elements of soft war.
The propaganda efforts made by the enemy in this regard are indicative of its weakness.
Whenever the enemy faces an overwhelming problem in the arena of realities, it steps up its propaganda efforts.
Today if one takes a look at the enemy's efforts in the vast arena of methods of propaganda - from Internet tools to audio visual means and to mouthpieces they have in different places inside and outside the country - one would see that one of the main techniques is to distort the events that happen in the country and to present the situation of the country as disappointing and in decline.
The fact that they are making so many efforts in this arena is indicative of their weakness in the arena of realities.
Of course the efforts have increased today. The propaganda efforts have increased because the current government officials are shouting the slogans of the Revolution more seriously, because the path of the Imam, the path of the Revolution and the path of rendering services for the people are more prominent today, because our government officials are populist and the people can feel this.
Today if you take a look at the enemies' propaganda, you will see that when they speak about economic matters, all they want to say is that we have reached a dead end, that the problems are insurmountable, that there are many problems and that bad things will happen in the future.
And there are some people who believe what they say and repeat their comments inside the country.
Before the elections and the fitna that followed, some people - who had successfully passed the test of fitna - used to come to me and say that the year 1388 would be a difficult time in terms of economic matters. They used to present the situation as gloomy, disappointing and overwhelming.
These propaganda efforts by the enemies show that they have not been able to keep pace with the great and accelerated movement by our people and government officials.
Therefore, if one realizes that the enemy has such a position, one will have an appropriate and accurate view of reality.
Similarly, in the area of foreign policy, you noticed the same thing in some of our newspapers or in the comments made last year by some elements of the fitna. They used to repeatedly say, "We have been humiliated in the world" and "The Islamic Republic has lost its honor and value in the world" and other such things.
Today when we look at the realities, we see that the Islamic Republic's honor has been increasing among different Muslim and non-Muslim nations in the world on a daily basis.
The enemies of the Iranian nation know, understand and feel this truth.
For example, why should we underestimate the President's trip to Lebanon?
If the same thing had happened to any other country, especially the leaders of arrogance, they would have opened a big chapter for it in political propaganda and analyses.
Lebanon is not our neighbor, and its people are not all Muslims. The population is a mixture of Muslims and Christians, and the Muslim population consists of Shia and Sunni Muslims.
Which country's president would be welcomed like that in another country?
And this is not particular to Lebanon.
Today if our prominent government officials go to Egypt and no restrictions are imposed, the same things would happen there too. The same is true of Sudan and all other Muslim countries.
This shows the greatness of the Iranian nation.
This is an achievement that you made.
The honor belongs to you. Such a thing would not have happened if the government had been isolated from the people and had not enjoyed the support of millions of motivated youth.
The honor belongs to you dear youth. Yet, look at the enemy's propaganda - it shows exactly the opposite of this.
Whenever they have to speak the truth, they distort it trough their analyses.
The same is true of the Basij itself. At a certain stage, the enemy focused its global propaganda efforts on the Basij, and these efforts are partially continued even today.
They said whatever they could.
They bombarded the Basij with negative propaganda in order to ruin its reputation in the eyes of the people, but they failed. "And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His words."
[The Holy Quran, 10: 82] Allah the Exalted will not let this obvious truth stay hidden. Therefore, the Basij has acquired increasing honor in our country on a daily basis.
Across the country, the youth who are active in different sectors consider the Basij as a great and brilliant identity and as the symbol of determination. You dear basijis should strengthen this. You should try to strengthen this by keeping the three elements - insight, sincerity and timely and proportional action - in mind.
It is necessary to avoid extremism. Going to extremes is harmful, no matter what the direction is.
Revolutionary enthusiasm should not be diminished at all.
These different mountains of problems that oppressed people across the world are faced with will not be eliminated unless through the willpower and firm determination of believers.
The goal is not just to improve the situation of the country.
The world of Islam and even humanity is in need of assistance from Islam and the Islamic Ummah.
This firm determination should be preserved. This revolutionary enthusiasm should be increased on a daily basis.
It is necessary to pay attention to God and rely on Him and His representatives.
There is no doubt that the future of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Ummah is far better than its present conditions.
For example, notice how much progress the Iranian nation has made in all political, scientific and social areas over the past 30 years - that is to say, since the beginning of the Revolution. You should know that our future progress will be even more than the amount of progress we have made so far.
The movement of the Iranian nation in all arenas is unstoppable.
By Allah's favor, Muslim nations will become more vigilant on a daily basis. I hope Allah the Exalted will hasten the re-appearance of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Dear God, make all Iranian people, especially our dear basijis, benefit from the prayers of that Imam.
Leader’s Speech to Members of IRGC - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on July 4, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to congratulate you dear members of this great revolutionary family on Revolutionary Guards' Day.
I would also like to congratulate all believers on the Eids of the holy month of Rajab which remind us of great achievements and on the holy of month of Sha'ban which is the month of mercy, remembrance of God, dhikr and reliance on God.
The interesting idea to have a day for members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and to relate this day to the auspicious birthday anniversary of Imam Hussein (a.s.) is a significant innovation which shows us the path.
It is necessary to thank those who were the first to think of this idea and to make us notice this concept. This is because the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has made an impressive promise to safeguard the Islamic Revolution.
I will briefly speak about this issue later on.
The concept of guardianship was embodied by Imam Hussein (a.s.) with all its dimensions and with all the necessary and possible means. This is not to say that others did not do such a thing or did not want to do such a thing, rather it means that this movement was fully realized in the behavior of the Lord of the Martyrs (a.s.) during his ten-year imamate.
One can clearly notice in his lifestyle all the methods that could have been used by a descendant of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) to preserve the great legacy of Islam which has been passed down by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and his father as well as their genuine followers. We can clearly see everything in the lifestyle of the Lord of the Martyrs (a.s.) - everything ranging from clarification, to forewarning, to promotion of Islam, to provoking the conscience of prominent figures of his time during a sermon in Mina.
All these things are tangible in the lifestyle of the Lord of the Martyrs (a.s.).
Imam Hussein (a.s.) was aware of the consequences of his movement. He was an infallible Imam.
Infallible Imams' extensive knowledge and insight are beyond our heads. Imam Hussein (a.s.) revolted to set a role model and he refused to surrender. He asked people to help him and when a group of people from Kufa expressed their willingness to accompany him on this path, Imam Hussein (a.s.) accepted their offer and moved towards Kufa and he did not give up in the middle of the way.
He said that his duty was what he was doing. He said that he had to express his opposition, no matter what the consequences were.
This was how Imam Hussein (a.s.) acted.
This was a perfect instance of self-sacrifice and it safeguarded Islam.
If Imam Hussein (a.s.) had not accepted this danger, if he had not made a move, if he had not taken action, if his blood had not been shed, if those great tragedies had not happened to the shrine of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), to Imam Ali's (a.s.) daughter and to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) descendents, this event would not have gone down in history.
What Imam Hussein (a.s.) did was an extraordinary feat.
That is to say, the dimensions of his action are far more than what we estimate.
Once I spoke about Imam Hussein's (a.s.) patience. His patience was not limited to enduring thirst or seeing his companions being killed.
The kind of patience that is difficult to practice is to listen to influential, aware and respectable people who keep creating doubts and telling you that what you are doing is dangerous and wrong. Who did those things?
People like Abdullah Ja'far, Abdullah Zubair and Abdullah Abbas. These prominent figures of that time were constantly telling Imam Hussein (a.s.) not to do what he was doing.
If it were somebody else, somebody who did not have that determination and stable character, he would have thought, "Well, I did my duty. These people are talking like this and the world is acting like that, so I should just say what I am supposed to say and do nothing else."
A person who decides to stand up against such statements, such temptations, such doubts and such efforts to bend sharia and is not dissuaded from continuing his path - such a person is the one who can give rise to such a great transformation.
In this regard our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was similar to the Lord of the Martyrs. I explained this in another meeting and I do not want to go into the details now.
This was how Imam Hussein (a.s.) acted as a guardian.
It is possible to criticize all currents, all groups, all individuals and all legal and natural persons. But if we consider the movement of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps in a fair way, we will see that the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has kept its promise since the first day.
Individual members come and go, but the collective identity of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has remained the same.
During my last meeting with the esteemed members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, I raised an important point.
I would like to discuss the point briefly. I said that the new generations of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should try to be a step ahead of the previous generations.
That is to say, the world is moving forward. It is moving towards perfection. It is an evolutionary movement.
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a young member who has just entered the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps to push the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps one step forward in terms of knowledge, insight, awareness and selflessness and in terms of willingness to work and doing the job in an appropriate and timely way - these are the characteristics that the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has demonstrated during these years.
Do not say, "How is this possible?" No, it is perfectly possible. Just take a look at the conditions of those days: our enemies had imposed a war on us and they were present on our soil.
Today we are no longer fighting a war, but there is a war that is more subtle and of course more dangerous. Awareness of the depths of this war requires more capability and more vigilance.
If we see certain people entering this arena, making efforts, fighting and staying in the arena with insight, then we can say that these people are not inferior to the war veterans in terms of motivation and performance.
The situation can be same in the future as well.
It is necessary to focus one's efforts on this goal. Today I will explain that the identity of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps as the guardian of the Revolution should not be interpreted as conservative.
In one analysis, this guardianship can be interpreted as conservative.
That is to say, we can say the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is responsible to preserve the current situation of the Revolution.
Why?
Because the Revolution is by nature a progressive movement, and an accelerated movement at that.
The principles and values which we should insist on and for which we should lay down our life, are the kind of principles and values that have been specified in our goals.
The ultimate goal is transcendence, perfection and closeness to God.
A less important goal is self-education. A less important goal is to establish an Islamic society in which all the characteristics of an Islamic society are present, including justice, monotheism and spirituality.
These are the goals.
No, the goal is to establish justice.
Monotheism and establishment of perfect sharia and justice - these are the goals and they cannot be changed.
The Revolution is moving in this direction.
Preserving and safeguarding the Revolution means maintaining this progressive movement.
This is the duty of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
If we adopt this perspective and interpret guardianship in this way, then the dynamism and enthusiasm that is embodied by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps will be intensified.
Today's youth do not limit themselves to surface manifestations that exist in our society to a large extent. Rather, they pay attention to the depth and nature of things. These are what they pursue.
Deep faith and further awareness: these are what we should look for.
This is the appropriate interpretation of guardianship - guardianship of the revolutionary movement and progress.
If we want this to happen, there are two things that have to be done in the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps. One is the internal progress of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
These two dimensions should move forward hand in hand.
If we ignore the first type of progress, we will fail to have the movement which will bring about progress and transcendence in the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the second kind of progress will be thwarted - that is to say, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps will fail to act as the driving force behind the Revolution.
This internal progress has a material aspect as well as a spiritual aspect.
The spiritual aspect consists of paying attention to the values in the real sense of the word - namely, specifying the standards, safeguarding them and evaluating oneself and others on the basis of these standards with the purpose of progress towards the goals in an appropriate way.
This is the spiritual aspect. And the material aspect is the good measures that are being adopted by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, the measures related to organization, science, research, development, military training and other such dimensions.
All these things should be done together.
This is internal progress. Such an organization can be the standard and a role model. Some of our people and youth may not join the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, but they may choose this organization as their role model in life - the appropriate model for spirituality and prudence, the model for choosing the right method and making the right move in areas related to reconstruction.
More precisely, today Islam is in need of this movement. The movement of the Islamic Republic has had its influence on the world.
That is to say, one cannot find a parallel movement in history.
Of course I have observed or studied the developments that have taken place in various parts of the world, especially in our own region.
I have seen revolutions that took place in North Africa and Latin America as well as the leftist revolutions that happened during the 1960s. It is not the case that I do not know the historical background of these developments. No, I have seen these things.
But what is happening today is unprecedented. These developments do not have a parallel. The events that happened in the 1960s - in Africa, in Latin America and in certain Asian countries - were often limited to one party or organization spreading its domination over the destiny of a nation with a material and Marxist orientation, a party or organization that lacked spirituality and divine elements.
The so-called revolutionary parities and governments that came to power in North Africa, including the governments of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Gaddafi and others - all of them seized power by staging a coup.
These were not popular and revolutionary in the real sense of the word. What is happening today is that people are present in the arena with their body and soul.
They are ordinary people.
This is the truth.
This is totally unprecedented.
According to what I have seen, heard or studied, such widespread developments are totally unprecedented. What is happening is new.
That is to say, a new page has been turned in the history of the region and, consequently, the world.
Of course the enemies are working on this issue with all their power.
They do not want this role model to be in front of Muslims' eyes. They do not want Muslim nations to see what position Iran has achieved.
But this is something that has already happened, whether they like it or not.
The scientific and technical work that is being done and the research that is being carried out by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and other organizations affiliated to the Armed Forces and the work that is being done outside the Armed Forces in our universities and different research centers - these are the things that specifically delineate future prospects.
That is to say, they are the factors that will determine the future.
Of course this has been achieved due to Islam and the revolutionary spirit and it is necessary to strengthen this spirit.
Therefore, this is how we should interpret guardianship of the Revolution.
We should interpret it as a dynamic and progressive concept. One of the things that we need to pay attention to in the arena of action is that we should take care not to let revolutionary organizations become involved with fruitless and possibly harmful activities during this progressive movement.
One of these fruitless and harmful activities is the issue of internal disputes. Sometimes a current may stand up against the Revolution with the purpose of defeating it. In this situation it is everybody's duty to defend the Revolution.
The Revolution defends itself like any other living creature.
If a revolution is unable to defend itself during the time of sedition and different kinds of military, political and other coups, then that revolution is not alive.
Our Revolution is alive, so it defends itself and it always wins, just as it did in the year 1388.
Other times it is not a matter of trying to overthrow the government: it is simply a matter of differences of taste and opinion. It is necessary to decrease these differences as much as possible.
It is harmful to fuel these differences of opinion.
One issue is that if a person says something that is wrong, should somebody respond to him? Yes, of course.
Responding to a faulty statement should be done in a particular way.
This is a mistake.
I am not at all opposed to clarification by anybody or any organization. On the contrary, I support clarification and I believe in it.
That is to say, clarification has been one of our essential strategies since the beginning.
Clarification is necessary, but this does not mean that we should constantly fuel internal disputes.
Be careful.
Everybody should be careful in this regard. The Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should be especially cautious.
And foreign organizations are extremely happy about this. They analyze these disputes. They say that there is discord among us.
It is clear that this issue is because of our weakness.
We should not let this weakness continue or increase.
It is necessary to pay attention to this point. The movement should be dignified and logical. If certain people have differences of opinion, they should express their views in a logical way.
As I said, I believe in clarification.
During the revolutionary activities, I had the same problem with leftist and Marxist elements who were also involved in revolutionary activities. I used to highlight the importance of clarification, but they did not believe in clarification.
They used to say something else. They had a different analysis.
Basically the Revolution was based on clarification, logical reasoning and avoidance of uproar. Uproar will work against logical reasoning.
It may succeed in attracting a few people, but a few other people who are more intelligent will be pushed away.
This is what I believe.
The movement should be a progressive movement.
There are a lot of requirements.
One of them is the need to form a unified front and this is related to the issue of unity which I discussed earlier. "Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way in ranks as if they were a firm and compact wall."
[The Holy Quran, 61: 4] It is necessary to stand up against the enemy's invasion like a firm and impenetrable wall. You dear youth who have joined the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and you honorable clergy, religious scholars and active, faithful and young seminarians who represent the Leader in the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps - all of you should be aware of two things.
Both the young members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the honorable clergy have a lot of things to do. Another issue is that you should know that if you make determined efforts, you can definitely do these things and after some time you will realize that you have made progress.
That is to say, if you make determined efforts, progress is definite. If there is determined effort and hope, progress is definite and there is no doubt in this regard.
All members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should pay attention to this point.
I hope Allah the Exalted will help you.
I hope Allah the Exalted will make you benefit from His blessings.
There is another point that I would like to raise because most of the high-ranking officials of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are present in this meeting.
But all of them need compassion and empathy.
You should pay attention to their families. And I hope our friends in the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps will have a unified and organized performance in this regard. I hope Allah the Exalted will keep you safe and will make you benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Leader's Speech in Meeting with Officials and Participants of Conference on Islamic Unity - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on January 9, 2015 by Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, in a meeting with government officials and foreign participants of the 28th Conference on Islamic Unity. The meeting was held on the occasion of the birthday anniversaries of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and Imam Sadiq (a.s.).
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to congratulate all the honorable participants on the occasion of the auspicious birthday anniversaries of the Holy Prophet of Islam and Imam Sadiq (peace and greetings be upon them).
The officials of the country, the dear guests of Unity Week and the honorable ambassadors of Islamic countries are present in this meeting.
I would like to extend my congratulations to the people of Iran, Islamic nations, the entire Islamic Ummah and all liberated people throughout the world - those for whom the issue of freedom and human values is very important.
Today is the birthday anniversary of the prophet of knowledge, wisdom, morality, mercy and unity. He was the prophet of all great human virtues.
Anyone who is attached to these human virtues loves the Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.).
You and I - the Muslims who claim and feel proud to follow this great personality and who are prepared to show resistance, lay down our lives and spend money on his path - need to follow his teachings and make efforts on this path.
The message of Islam includes this obedience and learning - that is to say, the knowledge, wisdom, acumen, mercy, unity, morality and other human characteristics that the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) message promoted and that Hazrat Abi Abdullah Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq (peace and greetings be upon him) made the most efforts to promote and establish.
Today, this is the responsibility of all Muslims.
Of course, the masses of the people follow the officials of countries.
It is governments, outstanding personalities, intellectuals, ulama, politicians and other such personalities who have the main responsibility in this vast arena.
Today, when I take a look at the issues of our own society and the issues of the world of Islam, I see that although all these great matters - including knowledge, wisdom and morality - are important for the world of Islam, the thing that is of primary importance is unity.
We Muslims have drifted away from one another to a great extent.
Unfortunately, certain policies have been successful in separating Muslims and the hearts of Muslim groups from one another.
Today, we need unity.
In this vast region - which forms a great portion of the population of the whole world - if Muslim nations join hands in general orientations, not in details, then the world of Islam will achieve progress and transcendence. If they are seen together, this will exert great influence.
If heads and outstanding personalities of Islamic countries speak against one another, this emboldens the enemy and gives him hope.
If we stay together even in our statements, this brings about greatness for the world of Islam and for the personality of the Islamic Ummah.
Whenever we witnessed instances of this unity and gathering - even if it is a mere gathering of bodies - its reflection in the world brought about dignity for Islam, for Muslims and for the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
When we read Eid ul-Fitr prayers together, we say, "You Who have turned this day into an Eid for Muslims. You Who have turned this day into a source of dignity, greatness and abundance for Muhammad (God's greetings be upon him and his household)" [al-Iqbal, page 289].
Even the mere gathering of bodies during prayers is a source of dignity for the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
The same is true of the gathering of Hajj.
This year, you witnessed that during Husseini Arbaeen, millions of people gathered.
People all over the world bowed down in respect to this great movement which was launched by a group of Muslims - of course, it was not particular to Shias and Sunnis too participated in this rally - and which sent waves throughout the world.
They considered it to be the greatest rally in the world. Who had such an opinion?
I deem it necessary to thank the government, people and different tribes of Iraq who made sacrifices, rendered services and showed greatness of character in this very important test.
This year's Arbaeen of Karbala was an astonishing event.
The enemies of Islam and Ahlul Bayt vainly thought that they had blocked the path of Muslims. Notice what a great movement was launched.
When even bodies stay together, it has such a reflection.
If we stay together, if Islamic governments and Muslim nations - whether Shia or Sunni or different denominations of Shia and Sunni - are honest with one another, if they are not suspicious of one another, if they do not insult and have malevolent intentions against one another, notice what will happen in the world and what great dignity will be brought about for Islam.
Today, some elements both among Sunnis and Shias are working at separating Muslims from one another.
If you trace these elements, you will see that all of them are connected to espionage and intelligence services of the enemies of Islam - not the enemies of Iran and Shia Muslims, rather the enemies of Islam.
The kind of Shia which works with the MI6 of England and the kind of Sunni which is a mercenary of the CIA of America are neither Shia nor Sunni.
Both of them are against Islam.
It is 35 years now that we in the Islamic Republic are letting out this cry. We do not only speak, rather we act.
The Islamic Republic's assistance to its Muslim brothers has mostly been given to Sunnis. We have stood beside the Palestinians.
We have stood beside the religious people of regional countries because we know that today, the issue of unity is at the top of Islamic issues.
I advise and I insist that well-known ulama, outstanding personalities and politicians of the world of Islam do not speak so much about discord and disunity. Some people in the world are spending money in order to promote Islamophobia and damage the reputation of Islam. And we ourselves are trying to damage one another's reputation and frighten people of one another.
This is against wisdom and politics.
I have heard that some regional governments have based their foreign policy on confronting Iran. Why should they do this?
This is against reason.
Why should someone make such a great mistake?
On the contrary, we have based our foreign policy on camaraderie, brotherhood and friendly relationship with all Muslim and regional countries, whether those which are our neighbors and those which are not.
This is our policy.
We have acted in the same way until now and we will act in the same way in the future.
Thankfully today, the people of Iran have gained such a deep awareness that they know the future interest of their country depends on Islamic unity with other Muslim nations and countries.
Of course, some people are trying very hard to create obstacles in the way of this unity, to arouse suspicions and to temp the people, but our people have thankfully understood this today.
The cry of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) - both before the victory of the Revolution and after the formation of the Islamic government - about the issue of unity paid off and our people became aware.
Today, all Muslims throughout the world should think about the Islamic Ummah and Islamic unity.
If we think of the Islamic Ummah, the interests of our countries will be safeguarded as well.
His interest lies in attacking one country and raising an army with the help of another country.
We should not allow him to do this.
Who is the enemy?
The enemy is American capitalism and global arrogance which is headed today by America and the Zionists.
The Zionist government in occupied Palestine is part of the dangerous group and the deadly cancer which the Zionists have created in the world.
We should stand up against them.
We should refer to Islam and Quranic texts in order to stand up against them.
Sometimes, one takes a look at some writings and sees that some people write certain things which are not based on Quranic ayahs.
The Holy Quran says, "Say you: â€˜We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Ibrahim, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to all prophets from their Lord'" [The Holy Quran, 2: 136].
After the Holy Quran speaks about the conditions that Muslims should believe in, it says, "So if they believe as you believe, they are indeed on the right path" [The Holy Quran, 2: 137].
Islam does not believe in pluralism.
Those who promote the idea that Islam believes in pluralism because it has praised Hazrat Moses and Hazrat Jesus should refer to the Holy Quran and Islamic texts. They put forward this idea without enough information and out of ignorance.
This is Islam: "So if they believe as you believe, they are indeed on the right path. But if they turn back, it is they who are in schism, but Allah will suffice you as against them" [The Holy Quran, 2: 137].
This is the meaning of the Holy Quran.
To the believers is he most kind and merciful" [The Holy Quran, 9: 128].
He is kind to believers and "those who are with him are strong against unbelievers, but compassionate amongst each other" [The Holy Quran, 48: 29].
You should be strong against those who show enmity to you and who are your enemies. You should be firm against them. You should not be like a soft earthwork which the enemy can infiltrate easily.
You should stand firm against the enemy, but you should be compassionate among yourselves.
You should be honest with and kind to one another.
This is one of the lessons of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Today - which is the birthday anniversary of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) - we should learn his lessons.
Mere praise of that great personality is not the only thing that is expected of us today. We should learn his lessons.
I hope that Allah the Exalted helps us to succeed in doing what we say.
Dear God, make the world of Islam and the Islamic Ummah stronger and more successful on a daily basis.
Leader’s Speech to Members of Assembly of Experts - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 8, 2012 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the chairman and members of the Assembly of Experts.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to welcome the honorable gentlemen, the esteemed members of the Islamic Republic’s Assembly of Experts.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the gentlemen who made certain points in this meeting, which shows that they are sensitive to the domestic issues and events and that they feel responsible towards the future of the country.
I hope Allah the Exalted will help all of us make efforts with pure intentions in order to fulfill the responsibilities that have been placed on our shoulders.
However, all of us should make efforts â€“ no matter where we work â€“ to move things forward. Before discussing the points I have written down, I deem it necessary to thank our honorable people for their timely and highly effective presence in the parliamentary elections.
Anybody who knows what efforts the enemies made during the past few months in order to discourage the people from voting on the 12th of Esfand, anybody who knows how much money they spent, anybody who knows how many people they recruited, anybody who knows how many plots they designed, anybody who knows how hard they tried in their think tanks to influence our people’s thoughts and actions with their carefully prepared statements, should know how great the achievement of the people was and how great the popular movement was.
First, it is necessary to be thankful to God because these things are the result of God’s will, mercy and grace.
Second, it is necessary to thank the people with all one’s heart and soul because divine blessings do not come to a particular country and its people without good reasons.
We pray to God, “Dear God, I ask You for the requirements of Your mercy.”We should prepare the ground for divine blessings and then we will be showered with divine grace and blessings. Our people prepared the ground for divine blessings.
The presence of the people on the scene, their resistance in the face of the enemies’ attacks, their insight and other such characteristics prepared the ground for divine blessings.
And we are truly grateful to our people and we hope that Allah the Exalted will fully reward them.
The first point that I would like to discuss is related to the issue of elections.
First of all, elections are an important pillar of the Islamic system.
Religious democracy is founded on elections.
Without elections, there will be no democracy.
Elections are the standard of relying on the people: a concrete, tangible and measurable standard.
Therefore, anybody who firmly believes in the Islamic system considers taking part in the elections as his responsibility. Such a person takes part in the elections even though he might have objections about certain things, about a particular election or about a particular form of elections.
This is a responsibility.
Therefore, all those who entered the arena of elections throughout the country fulfilled this obligatory responsibility. They carried out their duty. They showed their accurate understanding.
This accurate understanding shows that the issue of elections is about a pillar of the Islamic Republic.
We cannot stop voting simply because we have objections to certain individuals or certain things.
Such objections are not a good reason to stop voting. This is an essential point.
Elections are like an awakening slap across the face of the individuals who wallow in their illusions and fantasies.
Two days ago, I heard the American President has said that they are not thinking of going to war with Iran.
This is an illusion. The exit from illusion in the case of not going to war is good, but remaining under an illusion regarding the sanctions will harm them.
When a person builds his calculations on illusions rather than realities, it is obvious that he will fail in his plans that are based on these calculations. And this is what they are doing.
They said the purpose of the so-called crippling sanctions was to separate the people from the Islamic system, but they saw that the people went to the ballot boxes and voted for the Islamic system.
Every vote for any candidate is a vote for the Islamic system. The people proved this.
I described elections as a slap: there are different kinds of slaps. One of kind of slap is awakening â€“ it has an awakening effect. This parliamentary election was of this kind.
The second point â€“ which I mentioned in passing earlier â€“ is that elections show that the people trust the government.
After the controversial and eventful elections of the year 1388, certain people predicted that the people would lose their trust in the government and that they would no longer go to the ballot boxes to vote.
This election was a decisive and clear response to this wrong assumption and inference.
They showed that they are committed to the Islamic system. They showed that they trust the Islamic system. They showed that they will enter the arena and respond to the government’s call which invites them to determine the plans through the ballot boxes.
As I said, every vote is in fact a vote for the Islamic Republic.
The vast majority of the people who stepped into the arena gave rise to one of the highest turnout rates over the past 33 years.
The people entered the arena of elections after having analyzed the situation. They had their own analyses. You saw that whoever was asked why he or she had taken part in the election â€“ including the youth who were voting for the first time as well as old men and women â€“ he or she would present a reason and an analysis.
No, they would explain why they were voting.
This is a very important point.
Another point that is related to this election is that the Majlis that has emerged out of this election has a heavy responsibility to shoulder.
This is always the case.
Any elected government official at any level has a responsibility that is as important as the election through which they were elected. The Majlis that will be formed will have to shoulder a heavy responsibility considering current conditions, the uproar that the enemy has cause and the presence of the people in this arena.
The brothers and sisters who will come together to form this Majlis in the near future â€“ both the ones who have already been elected and the ones who will be elected during the second round â€“ should know what a heavy responsibility has been placed on their shoulders.
They should come and fulfill their responsibilities with wisdom and acumen.
The country is as important as the laws that are passed.
In all areas, we need laws that can remove the obstacles.
Members of the Majlis should look at the realities on the ground. They should identify the needs and on the basis of the needs they have identified, they should provide our government officials with the appropriate legal solutions.
The laws that are passed should remove the obstacles. A law that creates obstacles and blocks the paths, a law that cannot be implemented, a law that creates many problems, a law that contradicts itself â€“ such laws are useless.
They should both be careful and just.
I do not advise them to be extremely careful at the cost of causing injustice in certain cases.
They should be careful, but at the same time they should also observe justice.
They should move forward in an intelligent and sincere way. Sincerity is indeed the basis.
Mr. Mahdavi rightly pointed out in his statements that the weight and influence of Imam Khomeini’s (r.a.) words and plans was mostly due to his sincerity.
Yes, he was a truly sincere man. He was the embodiment of sincerity.
If there is sincerity, our duties will be carried out successfully.
The government officials in the judiciary and the Majlis, the clergy and those who are in the military or different other organizations should know that what is necessary is to identify our obligations and work hard to fulfill our obligations: we must not let other considerations affect our work.
Of course, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the officials in charge of the elections. Mr. Yazdi pointed out that the Guardian Council has been thanked for its efforts.
I prayed many times to Allah the Exalted to give more strength to all those who are in charge the elections: members of Assembly of Experts, the government, the Ministry of Interior, the officials in charge of security matters who managed to ensure the security of the elections, the officials in charge of public relations, the IRIB and others.
What they did was truly great and outstanding. They managed to carry out this great duty and this heavy and vital work in the best possible way.
Islamic democracy is our paradigm.
In Islamic democracy, Islam is the essence and the soul. There must be no deviations from Islam.
When drafting laws and when assigning individuals to different positions, our standard should be Islam.
The framework and the method of management is democracy.
Islam is still the essence and content of the movement of our system and democracy is the form and the framework.
That is to say, democracy itself originates from Islam.
It is wrong to say that we have learnt democracy from westerners.
The exterior form is the same, but our democracy has its roots in a different kind of religious understanding and a different world view.
We believe that there must be respect for human beings.
Westerners act in a different way. Of course, we have our own frameworks and they have their own frameworks, but their frameworks are oppressive.
Even if we assume that the event is not fictitious, even if we assume that it is a true story, is it a crime to deny a true historical event?
If a person is not convinced of the truth of the Holocaust and he denies the story or expresses doubt about it, he is thrown into prison.
This is what they are doing in the European countries that claim to be civilized.
This is their framework: if somebody wears hijab to university or work, she becomes a criminal.
It goes against correct human understanding.
We believe that it is necessary to stand up against these deviations.
This is religious democracy.
This is our paradigm.
If Muslim nations are interested in what the Islamic Republic has to say and what its claims are, they should know that we will not abandon Islam. We believe that it is obligatory to observe divine command and sharia in all of our daily life affairs and our efforts are focused on achieving this goal.
And religious democracy is our framework in this arena.
The people should step in and vote.
It is the people who should elect those who are supposed to implement the laws.
Everything is decided by the people with honor and dignity.
I hope Allah the Exalted makes us successful in following this path and protecting ourselves against deviations.
Leader’s Speech to Teachers and Graduates of Mahdaviat - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on July 9, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with teachers and graduates of Mahdaviat [faith in the re-appearance of the last Shia Imam, Imam Mahdi (a.s.)].
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to thank all the brothers and sisters who are working on different areas - including daily prayers, zakat, exegesis, Mahdaviat and all the other areas that Mr. Qara'ati spoke about.
All these areas are important and necessary. By Allah's favor, working on these areas is indeed a genuine charitable act that will be accepted by Allah the Exalted.
I would also like to thank everybody who has attended this meeting, especially Mr. Qara'ati.
We cannot really thank them because their efforts are for the sake of God and hopefully God will reward them for their efforts, but we should also appreciate their work.
Now I would like to make a few points in the company of you dear brothers and sisters.
Mr. Qara'ati is an exemplary person. First of all, the issues that he followed up were among the shortcomings that existed in the country.
If somebody manages to identify the needs and tries to fill the gaps, his efforts are highly valuable. This is how Mr. Qara'ati has acted.
Zakat was not really discussed in our society and the fact that it used to be sidelined was a weakness and a shortcoming. But he stepped into the arena and made determined efforts. He went to different places, spoke to different people, urged everybody to take action and worked tirelessly until he managed to address this problem.
The same is true of exegesis, Mahdaviat and the other areas that he is following up. This is one of the points that I wanted to raise about the work of our esteemed Mr. Qara'ati.
The second point, which is even more important than the first point, is related to his sincerity.
Allah the Exalted supports pure intentions.
And this is another point which is very important. I am not saying these things to praise Mr. Qara'ati or exaggerate what he has done.
I just want his efforts to be a model for all of us, especially for our seminarians.
This is the first point.
The second point is related to persistence.
I hope Allah the Exalted will help Mr. Qara'ati and all you dear brothers and sisters. I hope God will bestow health and a long life on all of you so that you can follow up what you have started.
These are important points. These days are close to the birthday anniversary of Imam Mahdi (a.s.), which is a great Eid for the Muslim world and even all of humanity.
Why?
Because Mahdaviat represents what all prophets were sent for - namely, building a monotheistic world on the basis of justice using all the capacities that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on humanity. This is the era that will come after the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (God's greetings be upon him and may God hasten his re-appearance): the era in which monotheism and genuine spirituality will be dominant over the entire life of human beings, the era in which justice will be established in the real sense of the word.
I have repeatedly said that the movement carried out over many centuries by humanity in the shade of the teachings of divine prophets is a movement towards the wide road which will be built after the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his re-appearance), the road that will lead humanity to lofty goals.
It is as if a group of people are guided by certain people through mountains, valleys, marshes and thorny bushes in order to reach the main road.
Humanity has moved through difficult paths and has cleared various obstacles in order to reach this main road. This main road is the road that will be built after the re-appearance of the Imam of the Age (a.s.). It is the world that will be built after the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (a.s.).
In a sense, the movement of humanity will start from that point.
For this reason, as far as I know, in all divine religions there are teachings which are essentially the same as Mahdaviat.
The issue of Mahdaviat is among the undeniable Islamic realities. That is to say, Mahdaviat is not limited to Shia Islam. All Islamic denominations accept that the end of the world will come when Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his re-appearance) establishes ultimate justice in the world.
There are valid narrations by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and Islamic luminaries in different denominations of Islam.
Therefore, there is no doubt in this regard.
However, Shia Islam has an advantage among other denominations because the issue of Mahdaviat is not an ambiguous issue in Shia Islam. The issue of Mahdaviat is not a convoluted and unintelligible issue in Shia Islam. It is clear.
And this familiarity is not based on Shia narrations alone. There are non-Shia narrations that clarify the details for us.
Followers of other Islamic denominations should pay careful attention in order to understand this clear truth.
This is the kind of importance that should be attached to the issue of Mahdaviat and we are better qualified to work on this issue.
The issue of waiting [for the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (a.s.)] is an integral part of Mahdaviat. It is one of the key concepts for understanding religion and the general movement of the Islamic Ummah towards the lofty goals of Islam.
Waiting means expecting an event that will definitely happen.
This is the meaning of waiting.
Waiting means that this future is definite.
There are certain narrations according to which people can see him, but they do not recognize him.
In certain narrations he has been likened to Prophet Joseph whose brothers used to see him.
Humanity needs this waiting and the Islamic Ummah needs it even more.
When a person is sure that there is such a future, he must expect it and be prepared for it.
Most surely in this is a message to people who are devout."
We should know that a great event will happen and we should always expect this event.
We can never say that the event will not happen in a few years and we can never say that the event will happen in the near future. We should always wait for it.
Those who are waiting should get closer to the characteristics that will be expected in the era that is being awaited.
This is the requirement for waiting.
If there is supposed to be justice, truth, monotheism, purity and worship in the era which we are awaiting, then as the people who are waiting, we should get closer to these things.
We should prepare ourselves for justice.
These are the requirements of waiting. One of the things that the essence of waiting requires is that we should not be satisfied with the status quo and with the level of progress we have made so far.
These are the requirements of waiting.
As Mr. Qara'ati said in his report, thankfully there are certain people who are doing scholarly work on the issue of waiting.
It is necessary to pay careful attention to scholarly and accurate work on the issue of waiting and on the era after the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (a.s.). It is also necessary to clearly avoid unscholarly and ignorant work in this regard.
Unscholarly and ignorant work - the kind of work that is not based on knowledge and valid documents and sources about the Imam of the Age (may God hasten his re-appearance) - is among the things that can be highly dangerous and it can prepare the ground for false claimants.
Unscholarly and undocumented work that is based on fantasies and illusions, rather than valid sources and documents, pushes people away from the state of waiting and prepares the ground for false claimants. It is necessary to seriously avoid such things.
There have been false claimants throughout history. As was mentioned in this meeting, certain claimants try to make a sign apply to themselves or other people.
Some of the things that are said about the signs of Imam Mahdi's (a.s.) re-appearance are not definite and they have not been mentioned in valid and documented narrations either.
They are based on narrations that are not solid and we cannot rely on them.
There have always been certain people who have tried to apply the poems of Shah Nimatullah Wali to different people in different centuries and I have seen some of these people.
His descriptions have been applied to a particular person and after a century or so the same descriptions have been applied to another person. These things are wrong and misleading. When there is deviation, the truth will be sidelined and it will be a tool to mislead people.
Therefore, it is necessary to seriously avoid unscholarly work and surrendering to rumors. Scholarly, firm and documented work is something that experts should do.
It is necessary to take this issue as seriously as possible so that the path is opened up for ordinary people.
Some of the duas that we have are very valuable and in certain cases they are good documents.
Tawwasul [seeking spiritual intercession and connection] to Imam Mahdi (a.s.) is done from a distance.
This tawwasul and this spiritual closeness are very good and necessary.
I hope Allah the Exalted will hasten the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi (a.s.).
Biography of Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution - Khamenei.ir
On the 16th of July 1939, the future Leader of Islamic Iran was born in the holy city of Mashhad, in the province of Khorasan.
Sayyed Ali was the second son of Sayyed Javad Khamenei, a humble and poor Islamic scholar who taught all members of his family how to lead a simple, humble way of life.
My father, though a well-known religious figure, was a bit of an ascetic. 0.135094 154.txt 2130-2130.txt Ina iya tunawa wasu ranakun ma ko abin da za mu ci da dare ma ba mu da shi a gidan. Da kyar mahaifiyarmu take dan shirya mana abin da za mu sa a baki, shi din ma biredi ne da zabibi kawai. Sometimes for supper we had nothing but bread with some raisins, which our mother had somehow improvised.... our house, some sixty-five square meters, consisted of a single room and a gloomy basement. 0.123310 154.txt 2130-2130.txt Har lokacin da wasu masoyan mahaifinmu suka saya masa dan wani waje a kusa da gidanmu a nan ne fa aka samu damar gina wasu dakuna biyu muka zamanto muna da dakuna uku kenan”. Years later some charitable persons bought the small, empty lot adjacent to our house, so we were able to build two more rooms.
At the age of four Sayyed Ali and his older brother Mohammad, were sent to maktab, the traditional primary-schools of that time, in order to learn the alphabet and the Holy Quran. Later, he was transferred to a newly established Islamic school to continue his learning.
The main encouraging factors for this enlightened decision were my parents, especially my father says Ayatollah Khamenei today.
At Soleiman Khan and Nawwab religious schools and under the supervision of his father and the tutorships of some great religious scholars, he studied all the 'intermediate level ' curriculum including logic, philosophy and Islamic jurisprudence in the exceptionally short time of five years.
He then started his advanced level studies called darse kharij with such eminent scholars and instructors as Grand Ayatollah Milani.
He was fascinated by the theological and academic instructions of such eminent scholars such as Ayatollah Hakim and Ayatollah Shahrudi. He attended their lessons and was willing to stay there and continue his studies in order to profit from these excellent teachers. However his father made it known that he preferred his son continue his advanced studies in the holy city of Qum.
Thus, respecting his father's wish, he returned to Iran in 1958.
Diligently and enthusiastically he followed his advanced studies in Qum from 1958 to 1964 and benefited from the teachings of great scholars and grand ayatollahs such as Ayat. Borujerdi, Imam Khomeini, Ayat. Haeri Yazdi and Allamah Tabatabai.
He received the bad news that his father had lost his sight in one eye and was not able to read properly. This prompted him to return to Mashhad and while being at the service of his father, seek further knowledge from him, from Ayatollah Milani and other important scholars residing in Mashhad.
Recalling this important point of departure in his life, the Leader says, "If there have been any successes in my life, they all go back to God's blessings favored upon me because of my dutiful caring for parents." POLITICAL ACTIVITIES "In the areas of political and revolutionary ideas and Islamic jurisprudence, I am certainly a disciple of Imam Khomeini" says Ayatollah Khamenei.
He adds: "Yet the very first sparks of consciousness concerning Islamic, revolutionary ideas and the duty to fight the Shah's despotism and his British supporters, was kindled in my soul at the age of 13 when the brave cleric, Nawwab Safavi, later martyred by the Shah's regime, came to our school in Mashhad in 1952 and delivered a fiery speech against the Shah's anti-Islamic and devious policies."
In May of 1963 (corresponding to the holy month of Muharram), Imam Khomeini honored the young, brave cleric Sayyed Ali, with the mission of taking a secret message to Ayatollah Milani and other clergymen in Mashhad, on the ways and tactics of exposing the true nature of the Shah's regime.
Here he was arrested for the first time and spent one night in jail. The following the authorities ordered him not to speak at the pulpit again. From that moment he knew that he would be under police surveillance all the time.
Of course he did not submit to police threats, and as a result of his activities relating to the bloody June 1963 Uprising (15th of Khordad ), he was again arrested and transferred to Mashhad to spend ten days in prison under severe conditions.
In January 1964 (Ramadhan 1383), according to a well-organized plan, Ayatollah Khamenei and a few close friends traveled to Kirman and Zahedan in southern Iran, to expose the phony referendum the Shah was holding for his so-called reforms. There in the course of many public speeches, he exposed the satanic American policies of the Pahlavi regime. This time, the Shah's feared intelligence agency, SAVAK, stepped in and arrested him one late evening.
He was taken to Tehran by an airplane to spend two months in solitary confinement during which time he was tortured.
Once freed, he started holding lessons on the exegeses of the Holy Quran, the Prophetic Traditions and Islamic ideology in Mashhad and Tehran.
They thought that there must be links between these revolutionaries and people like me because of my intellectual and diligent activities.
LAST ARREST AND EXILE Throughout the years 1972-1975, Ayatollah Khamenei was holding classes on the Holy Quran and Islamic ideology in three different mosques in Mashhad. These classes together with his lectures on Imam Ali's (as) Nahjul Balagha attracted thousands of conscious, politically-minded youth and students.
The lectures were circulated among the people in hand-written or typed forms, in most towns and cities.
His students traveled to distant cities to spread his lessons and ideas. All this frightened the Shah's SAVAK agents and so, in the winter of 1975, they broke into his home in Mashhad and arrested him for the 6th time and confiscated all his books and notes.
In the autumn of 1975, he was freed and sent back to Mashhad and he was now completely banned from delivering lectures or holding classes.
His clandestine activities, however, prompted SAVAK to apprehend him in the winter of 1976 and sentence him to exile for three years.
Thus, after nearly 15 years of bearing all sorts of torture and maltreatment at the hands of the agents of the Shah's bloodthirsty regime, he could now witness the fall of the tyrannical Pahlavi regime and the rise of an Islamic Republic in Iran. THE VICTORY OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
Shortly before the triumph of the Islamic Revolution (February 11, 1979) and before Imam Khomeini's victorious return to Iran from Paris, an Islamic Revolutionary Council was formed at the behest of the Imam.
1980- Founding member of the Islamic Republic Party, together with such religious scholars and Mujahids as Shahid Beheshti, Rafsanjani, Shahid Bahonar, and Musavi-Ardebili.
• Deputy-Minister of Defence • Supervisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
• Imam of Tehran's Friday Congregational Prayers, per Imam Khomeini's decree.
• Elected Tehran MP in the Majlis (Consultative Assembly)
1982- Elected President of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the martyrdom of President Mohammad Ali Rajai (Ayatollah Khamenei was himself the target of an assassination attempt at Abu Dhar mosque in Tehran after which he was hospitalized for a few months).

Leader’s Speech to Families of Martyrs and War Veterans of Kermanshah - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 13, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the families of martyrs and war veterans of Kermanshah province.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me this opportunity today to be present in this great meeting.
On my trips to different cities, as far as I am concerned one of the greatest and most important meetings is the meetings that are arranged with the honorable families of our martyrs and war veterans.
The reason is that there is such greatness in self-sacrifice that no society can achieve glory and dignity in the absence of it. We usually fail to see all the aspects and dimensions of the martyrdom of our martyrs and the self-sacrifices of our war veterans. This is while engaging in self-sacrifice in society, which might lead to martyrdom or physical disabilities, has many different meanings and dimensions.
One of these aspects is identifying the opportunities that present themselves and responding to the needs of the moment.
The brave, proud, pious and selfless youth who identified the needs of the country and welcomed the dangers, those youth had an outstanding characteristic: they identified the needs at the right time and they responded to those needs.
This is a crucial aspect and a lesson for us.
Yesterday I mentioned that one month after the victory of the Revolution the youth of Kermanshah felt that they were needed in the battlefields.
Shahid Sayyid Mohammad Ja'fari - the pioneering and outstanding martyr - and his friends prepared themselves to go and defend the military base of Sanandaj Army. They understood the significance of this defense.
This ability to identify the needs quickly and to take action to address them at the right time is the important point that must not be ignored.
All of our dear martyrs across the country had this characteristic.
The dear friends and brothers mentioned the names of certain cities and recounted memories of the defense lines that had been formed in this province.
Of course, there were people from all parts of the country. There were prominent people from other parts of the country who were martyred in this province. However, we must not ignore the role of the people of this province, the role of the pious youth of Kermanshah, the role of the exceptional and valuable characteristics that those youth had: their vigilance and their ability to identify the opportunities.
And these characteristics are exactly what we have always needed and what will always need.
Different countries and societies are often harmed because they fail to identify the opportunities. When the enemies lie in ambush and we fail to notice this or fail to take action to deal with the situation at the right time, we get harmed.
The dear brother who spoke in this meeting made a good point.
He said that Iranian families believed that if they failed to send their youth to the battlefield, they would have to fight against the enemies in the streets.
This is a very important point: it is the same point that has also been mentioned by the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.): any community of people who fail to take action while the enemy is coming and are forced to push the enemy out of their homes, will be defeated.
It is necessary to identify enemy attacks from a distance.
In Tehran, there were constant reports that the enemy forces were being deployed in Kermanshah and Ilam and those activities were mostly in Kermanshah.
Our politicians used to dismiss those reports, saying that there were no such military activities in the country.
This continued until the enemy dropped bombs on Tehran.
In fact, the war did not break out on Shahrivar 31, 1359: that was the time when Tehran was bombarded and the war had already started.
If the officials who were in charge of the affairs of our country at that time - the same people who proved later on that they were not competent enough to run the country - had identified the threat and prepared the country for the war, those things would not have happened to Khorramshahr, Qasr-e Shirin and certain other border cities.
That initial lack of vigilance caused such a tragic atmosphere in this region and the Khuzestan region. I witnessed some of the events up close and they were so tragic that I cannot erase them from my memory.
When the people are in charge, when the people are given the opportunity to enter the arena with their capacities, such lack of vigilance would not happen.
But they would not allow this at that time.
In these areas, groups of people would come together here and there and they would start defending the country after going through a lot of trouble to gather weapons.
This is a lesson for us.
As I pointed out yesterday, a government like the Islamic Republic - with such ideals, with such goals, with such great claims - which is opposed to oppression, arrogance and the arrogant greed of the international powers, would naturally face different kinds of challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to be prepared.
This preparedness depends on religious faith of the people more than anything else.
Awareness of the people is a great protective wall that helps a nation defend its identity and dignity and protects it against the machinations of Satan.
We experienced this during the war.
Today the same thing will happen in every sector and in every field of endeavor where there are vigilant officials who are prepared to give the people a role to play.
Our government is an Islamic republic: it is a democracy, an Islamic democracy.
Our martyrs and disabled war veterans as well as their families passed the most difficult test on this path.
The great patience, which was shown by the families of our martyrs, is very valuable.
If the families of our martyrs and soldiers had not shown patience and understanding and if they had displayed a lack of insight, the atmosphere of self-sacrifice would not have lasted.
The families of our martyrs and soldiers showed patience.
Many years have passed since the Sacred Defense Era, but the door of martyrdom is not yet closed. We still see certain families whose dear ones are martyred for different reasons.
If a nation enjoys such insight and such patience, it will definitely reach the peaks.
We never wavered in identifying our goals and determining the path to reach them. We never wavered in our faith in the path we had chosen and we are thankful to Allah the Exalted for this.
Allah the Exalted never let our hearts lose the light of hope and we saw with our own eyes that our hope was not false hope.
There was a day when it appeared to certain individuals that there was no hope for us, but there were insightful people - and our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was the distinguished person among them - who would give us hope.
Sometimes we would listen to them obediently, but we were not able to analyze the situation properly.
And today when we take a look at our 32-year experience after the Revolution, we constantly see the achievements that the Islamic Republic has accomplished.
In my meetings with the honorable families of our martyrs and war veterans, after expressing my appreciation and respect, I primarily try to tell our dear people that the spirit of self-sacrifice can save a country.
The spirit of self-sacrifice and identifying the right time to fulfill one's duty can deliver a nation.
Fortunately today we can see the signs of progress and success in our country. We can see that we are moving forward. Of course, we need to make efforts.
Our people are far more vigilant than they used to be in the past.
Thankfully there are many people in our society who are faithful, pious and committed to the ideals, which is the case with the honorable people of this province as well.
As I said yesterday, all I have seen in this province is heroic characteristics among both men and women.
It was mentioned in the meeting that a lady - a faithful and brave woman - had captured an enemy soldier during the war.
There are so many manifestations of bravery in this province that one cannot mention all of them.
Since the first day, the people of this region made sacrifices together with our military forces. We had brave and competent commanders from this province, Air Force commanders who would offer facilities and tactical support to Shahid Shiroudi and others in order to carry out those amazing operations, both in Army 81 and elsewhere.
They used to work so sincerely and so selflessly that they had filled the atmosphere of this region with the signs of sincerity, self-sacrifice, heroism and selflessness. And this is among the things that your province should feel proud of: it will remain for you.
You were at the vanguard of the Sacred Defense.
I hope our government officials will manage to do what is necessary in this province.
There are many things that have to be done in this province. Kermanshah province has a lot of potential.
There are also certain shortcomings and these shortcomings should be followed up and eliminated through the efforts of our government officials. Greetings be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 26, 2009 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the officials in charge of hajj affairs.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The hajj should be viewed as a blessing and a great divine opportunity.
This is true of all kinds of worshiping. Daily prayers are also an opportunity and a blessing.
If daily prayers had not been declared as obligatory, we might have sunk into the sea of pure unawareness.
Praying is a great blessing that provides us with the opportunity to talk to God and humbly prostrate before him several times a day. The same is true of the hajj.
Being international is the advantage of the hajj over other Islamic obligations.
In spite of all their racial, linguistic, and cultural differences, all Muslims engage in solemn and humble praying during the hajj ceremonies.
This is an extraordinary phenomenon, but we fail to realize its greatness and importance appropriately because we are used to it.
During the hajj, all Muslims assemble in one place, focus their attention on the same thing, and prostrate before the same center. That is how we should view the hajj. We should view it as an opportunity.
If we consider the hajj as an opportunity, then we will have a better view of our obligations and will pay more attention to them.
This is the first opportunity.
Every minute and every hour of the hajj is an extremely valuable opportunity, and we should not spend them on the petty everyday activities and untimely entertainment that we engage in at our own marketplaces and in different other places. In Mecca and Medina, we should think of increasing our faith, our spiritual qualities, and our humility before God.
This is the first step we should take.
The opportunity to establish a relationship with the world of Islam is another manifestation of this great opportunity.
It is ordinary citizens who make up the world, not politicians, not bullying commanders, and not the arrogant powers of the world.
Sometimes you hear the arrogant powers attribute the output of their corrupt minds to the global community. They say the global community wants this or that!
The same is true of the Islamic Ummah.
The Islamic Ummah is not the individuals who have used various means to dominate a portion of the world of Islam.
It is the willpower of these ordinary members that can cause great changes.
It is the movement of these ordinary citizens that can promote Islamic values in the world.
Each year during the hajj, hajj pilgrims encounter a large number of these ordinary members of the Islamic Ummah as well as the glory of the world of Islam.
This is an opportunity, and it should be appreciated.
How should we appreciate this opportunity?
There are various ways to do that.
For example, through their behavior and actions, the Iranian Muslims - who live under the flag of Islam and the Islamic Republic - should introduce the kind of Islam promoted by the Islamic Republic. They should show how Islamic education has affected them.
This is one of the easiest ways to appreciate this opportunity.
In Masjid al-Haram, in Masjid al-Nabawi, in Baqi', and at the shrines of the martyrs of the Battle of Uhud as well as in Mena and Arafat, hajj pilgrims should show their Islamic education through their behavior. They should show their Quranic education. They should show that they are humble and kind, and that they are not the kind of people to insult other people.
Obviously, Imam Sadiq would not have compared the prayers led by an ordinary prayer leader with the prayers led by the Prophet (s.w.a.).
It highlights the importance of unity.
You should show unity in practice. For the same reason, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) advised all of us and all Iranian hajj pilgrims to participate in the congregational prayers held in Masjid al-Haram and Masjid al-Nabawi.
When other people are saying their prayers in congregational prayers, Iranian pilgrims should not be carrying their luggage to their hotel rooms.
Such things are harmful.
Behavior that shows one's Islamic education is one of the most important things [during the hajj].
Even if you do not know Arabic and do not speak to other pilgrims, the mere fact that you behave politely, observe the standards of hygiene, and engage in dhikr and dua as an Iranian pilgrim is like a great effort to promote Islam, which is more important than many kinds of publicity efforts. This great congregation of believers engage in solemn praying, repentance, and weeping.
This is itself a kind of publicity for Islam.
Participating in the ceremonies to express your hatred towards polytheism is itself great publicity for Islam, which shows that you have accepted the hajj in its totality.
The hajj is the manifestation of monotheism.
Regarding the hajj, there is another point that I would like to discuss: The great caravan of the Iranian pilgrims - which is a source of honor for the Islamic Republic - should try to address the current needs of the Islamic Ummah.
We should identify the needs of the Islamic Ummah each year.
Islamic unity has been one of the important needs of the Islamic Ummah throughout the past few years. One can feel that unity among different Islamic denominations is one of the current needs.
You should consider what the enemies of the world of Islam are doing in order to create a split in the Islamic Ummah.
You should consider how much money they are spending in order to line up different groups of Muslims against one another.
For many consecutive centuries, Shia and Sunni Muslims have lived together peacefully in Iraq.
They had the same beliefs in the past as they do today, but such events were unprecedented in the past centuries.
The same is true of the bloody events that have occasionally taken place in our country as well as the events that happen in Pakistan.
Who are the people who insult what Shia and Iranian pilgrims hold sacred?
Sometimes they even harass the female family members of the pilgrims. Who are these people?
Everybody should be vigilant in this regard. The Saudi government is responsible for safeguarding the pilgrims of the House of God and the shrines of the infallible Imams (a.s.) and the Prophet (s.w.a.).
When a person insults or hurts a Shia pilgrim or clergyman, it is not appropriate for Saudi officers to stand by and watch or help the attacker. These things work against unity.
The pilgrims of the Ka'bah cannot afford to be unaware of the developments of the Muslim world.
Today Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and some parts of Pakistan are under the pressure of foreign soldiers - they are under the pressure of the measures taken by the arrogant powers.
These are the things that we should pay attention to during the hajj.
The hajj should be the manifestation of the willpower and strong determination of the Islamic Ummah against the measures that are aimed at undermining Islamic unity or thwarting the progress of the Islamic Ummah - the measures that are aimed at undermining the flag of Islam, which is thankfully being carried by the Islamic Republic today. We should be alert.
These are our duties. Our management of the caravans, our publicity, and other such affairs should be based on these needs. Our cultural and political planning and our choices should be based on these needs.
I would like to express my gratitude to all the esteemed officials in charge of the hajj and all those who have made efforts during the past years to carry out this great duty. I would like to thank Mr. Reyshahri, Mr. Khaksar, and other government officials as well as the esteemed ministers of Culture and Islamic Guidance. I also thank the heads of the caravans, the esteemed clergymen who accompany the caravans, and all the dear officials who have attended this meeting.
Your goal is a great goal, and your responsibility is extremely heavy.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of you.
Imam Khamenei’s Hajj Message - 2016
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
And all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and Allah’s greetings be upon our Master, Muhammad, and upon his immaculate household and chosen companions and upon those who follow them rightfully until the Day of Judgment.
Muslim brothers and sisters across the world!
For Muslims, the season of hajj is the season of pride and glory in the eyes of God’s servants, the season of enlightening hearts, the season of humility before the Creator and of solemn prayer.
Hajj is a heavenly, earthly, divine and communal obligation.
On the one hand, the commands “then remember Allah as you remembered your fathers, rather a greater remembering” [the Holy Quran, Sura al-Baqara, Ayah 200] and “remember Allah during the appointed days” [the Holy Quran, Sura al-Baqara, Ayah 203] and on the other hand, the declaration “whoever shall incline therein to wrong unjustly, We will make him taste of a painful chastisement” [the Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj, Ayah 25] shed light on its infinite and diverse dimensions.
During this unparalleled obligation, temporal and spatial security bestows tranquility on the hearts of human beings like a clear sign and a brilliant star and draws hajj pilgrims out of the siege of insecurity by domineering oppressors that constantly threatens humanity and it helps humanity taste the pleasure of security during a particular period of time.
Abrahamic hajj, which Islam has presented to Muslims as a gift, is the manifestation of pride, spirituality, unity and glory.
It demonstrates to ill-wishers and enemies the greatness of the Islamic Ummah and its reliance on God’s eternal power. It highlights the distance between Muslims and the cesspool of corruption, humiliation and tyranny that international oppressors and bullies impose on human communities.
The Islamic and monotheistic hajj is the manifestation of being “firm against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves” [the Holy Quran, Sura Fath, Ayah 29].
It is the stronghold of renouncing unbelievers and promoting friendship and unity among believers.
Those who have reduced hajj to a religious-tourist trip and have hidden their enmity and malevolence towards the faithful and revolutionary people of Iran under the name of “politicizing hajj”, are themselves small and puny satans who tremble for fear of jeopardizing the interests of the Great Satan, the U.S.
Saudi rulers, who have obstructed the path of Allah and Masjid ul-Haraam this year and who have blocked the proud and faithful Iranian pilgrims’ path to the Beloved’s House, are disgraced and misguided people who think their survival on the throne of oppression is dependent on defending the arrogant powers of the world, on alliances with Zionism and the U.S. and on fulfilling their demands.
Almost one year has now passed since the horrifying events in Mina, as a result of which several thousand people tragically lost their lives- under the hot sun with thirsty lips- and this happened on the day of Eid while they were in the clothes of ihram.
Shortly before that, another group of people were crushed to death in Masjid ul-Haraam while they were worshiping and performing tawaf and salat.
Saudi rulers were at fault in both cases. This is what all those present, observers and technical analysts agree upon.
The heartless and murderous Saudis locked up the injured with the dead in containers- instead of providing medical treatment and helping them or at least quenching their thirst. They murdered them.
Several thousand families from different countries lost their loved ones and their nations were bereaved.
The hearts of their families are still broken and bereaved and our people remain grief-stricken and angry.
Instead of apology and remorse and judicial prosecution of those who were directly at fault in that horrifying event, Saudi rulers- with utmost shamelessness and insolence- refused to allow the formation of an international Islamic fact-finding committee.
Instead of being tried as the accused, they acted like the plaintiff and with increased malice and vileness, they revealed their long-standing enmity towards the Islamic Republic and towards any flag of Islam raised to confront kufr and arrogance.
Their propaganda mouthpieces- from the politicians whose behavior towards the Zionists and the U.S. is a source of disgrace for the world of Islam, to impious and haraam-eating muftis who blatantly issue fatwas against the Book and Sunnah, and to media minions who are not even deterred by codes of professional conduct from spreading and telling lies- are making futile efforts to show that the Islamic Republic is at fault for depriving Iranian pilgrims of this year’s hajj pilgrimage.
The fitna-promoting rulers who by forming and arming wicked takfiri groups, have plunged the world of Islam into civil wars, murdering and injuring the innocent and shed blood in Yemen, Iraq, the Levant, Libya and other countries- the godless politicians who have extended the hand of friendship towards the Zionist regime, have closed their eyes on the Palestinians’ sufferings and heartrending tragedies and have spread their oppression and betrayal to the cities and villages of Bahrain- the irreligious and unconscionable rulers who gave rise to the great tragedy in Mina and in the name of being servants of the two holy places, sacrificed divine sanctity and God’s guests on the day of Eid in Mina and in Masjid ul-Haraam shortly before that- these same people are now claiming the need to avoid politicizing hajj and are accusing others of the great sins that they themselves have committed and caused.
They are the perfect example of the enlightening Quranic description: “And when he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and to destroy crops and cattle and Allah does not love mischief.
And when it is said unto him: Be careful of your duty to Allah, pride takes him to sin.
Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place” [the Holy Quran, Sura al-Baqara, Ayahs 205-206].
Based on reports, this year as well, besides barring the participation of Iranian pilgrims and pilgrims from certain other countries, they have placed pilgrims from the participating countries under unprecedented surveillance with the help of the spy agencies of the U.S. and the Zionist regime. They have made the divine sanctuary unsafe for everybody.
The world of Islam, including Muslim governments and peoples, must familiarize themselves with the Saudi rulers and correctly understand their blasphemous, faithless, dependent and materialistic nature.
They must not let those rulers escape responsibility for the crimes they have caused throughout the world of Islam.
Because of these rulers’ oppressive behavior towards God’s guests, the world of Islam must fundamentally reconsider the management of the two holy places and the issue of hajj.
Negligence in this regard will confront the Islamic Ummah with more serious problems in the future.
Muslim brothers and sisters! This year enthusiastic and sincere Iranian pilgrims are absent from the hajj ceremonies, but they are spiritually present among the pilgrims from different parts of the world and they are concerned about them and they pray that the evil progeny of the taghut do not succeed in harming them.
In your duas, worship and prayers, remember your Iranian brothers and sisters and pray that the sufferings be removed from Islamic communities and that the Islamic Ummah be liberated from the hands of the arrogant powers, the Zionists and their followers.
I commemorate those who were martyred in Mina and Masjid ul-Haraam last year and the martyrs of Makka of the year 1987. I pray to Glorious God to bestow clemency and mercy and the highest positions on them. I extend my greetings to the Imam of the Age- may my soul be sacrificed for his sake- and I ask Allah that the accepted prayers of that honorable Imam improve the Islamic Ummah and save Muslims from the fitna and malevolence of the enemies.
And providence belongs to Allah and reliance is on Him.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Dhu al-Qa’dah 1437, September 2016
Leader’s Speech to Laborers - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 29, 2012 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with laborers of pharmaceutical companies.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate, pure and chosen household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I congratulate our honorable laborers as well as the people of Iran on the occasion of Labor Week.
If the efforts of laborers, entrepreneurs and skilled manpower are appreciated in a society, that society will make progress. When the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) bowed down to kiss the hand of a laborer, he was not just showing his appreciation to a particular person.
The labor of a laborer is so valuable that even a person like the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) - who is superior to the entire creation - bows down to kiss his hand.
This is a lesson for us.
Labor in the broad sense of the word - which includes physical labor, intellectual labor, scientific work and managerial work - is in fact the pivot of a society's progress and survival.
In the absence of labor, neither capital, nor raw materials, nor energy, nor information would be useful for mankind.
Labor is like the soul of capital, energy and raw materials and turns them into something useful, a product that can be consumed.
This shows the value of labor.
In the Islamic Republic nobody stands on ceremony with laborers and makes ceremonial gestures.
Certain people established a so-called labor government during an era and kept the world busy for a few decades, but they did not benefit laborers.
Leaders of socialist and communist countries took advantage of their societies.
They lived a happy life just like other taghuti governments in the world, all in the name of laborers.
What they did was a lie, a ceremonial gesture.
In the west, the main purpose of different kinds of labor insurance, support for laborers and other such things is to encourage laborers to work so that the "one percent" can enjoy the outcome and live a happy life. They are not honest with laborers. Islam is honest with laborers.
Labor is a value.
This narration - which uses figurative language - says that knowledge calls upon labor and if labor responds, knowledge stays and develops and if labor fails to respond, knowledge disappears.
Notice how beautifully the concept has been expressed. Emergence, permanence and progress of knowledge depend on labor. This is the logic of Islam.
These are the intellectual principles of Islam. Islam is honest with laborers.
A lot of things have been done in this regard and it is necessary to do a lot of other things.
For this reason, I named this year the year of "Supporting Iranian Labor and Capital".
In the absence of capital, there would be no labor.
Labor and capital are the two wings of national production.
It is necessary to appreciate both Iranian capital and Iranian labor.
And it is necessary to translate this principle into action. So far, our honorable laborers have arranged annual meetings with me in a Hussayniyyah on the occasion of Labor Week.
I would meet them in a Hussayniyyah and speak to them. This year I decided to come and visit our laborers.
You dear laborers of this company and those of you who have come from other companies should pay attention to the point that I arranged this meeting to express my respect and gratitude for Iranian labor and laborers.
As long as we do not appreciate the value of Iranian labor and capital, we will not achieve national production.
And if we fail to achieve national production, our country will fail to achieve economic independence.
And if a society fails to achieve economic independence - that is to say, if a society does not manage to make independent economic decisions and stand on its own feet - it will not achieve political independence.
And if a society fails to achieve political independence, other things will not matter.
As long as a country has not strengthened its economy and made it independent, it cannot play a significant role in political, cultural and other areas.
Our country needs a powerful and stable economy.
In my public addresses over the past 3, 4 years, I have warned our people, youth and officials that the enemy has focused his machinations on our economy.
Now you can see that the signs of this great plot are becoming visible one after the other.
Of course, by relying on your firm determination, you dear people of Iran will remove this obstacle from your path, just as you removed the other obstacles that lay on your path.
And our people should show their firm determination in consuming our domestic products.
It is necessary to adopt fundamental measures. Fortunately efforts are already being made. As was pointed out by our esteemed executive officials, since the beginning of this year they have focused on this issue in their meetings, plans and discussions.
Everybody must make efforts in order to give promote national production and to strengthen our economy.
Primarily it is our government officials - in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of government - who should make efforts in this regard. Sometimes things might end up in the judiciary.
As far as labor, production and investment are concerned, the health of our economy depends on the cooperation of all the three branches of government.
Various measures should be adopted on different fronts: regarding the issue of improving the skills of the workforce, the issue of correct managerial attitudes, the issue of empowering the workforce, the issue of confronting economic disruption in the right way, the issue of sense of security for both laborers and investors.
That is to say, our plans, laws and regulations should be such that both our laborers and our investors should feel secure.
One example of economic disruption is the issue of smuggling.
Sometimes stealing is from a particular individual and other times it is from a nation, which is more serious.
It is necessary to confront such disruption.
Several years ago, when I wrote letters to the heads of the three branches of government and warned of economic corruption, certain people were alarmed that my warnings would scare off the potential investors.
I announced that the opposite was true.
An investor who wants to have healthy economic activities in the country would be happy to see that we are fighting economic corruption and economically corrupt individuals.
Of course, fortunately many advances have been made today in the area of domestic production.
Definitely what has been done in this regard is more than what the people know.
The novel and outstanding work that has been done in this company is very valuable. The company was established and operated by the Iranian workforce in a short period of time.
However, as far as highlighting domestic production is concerned, the issue of quality is very important and our esteemed production managers and laborers should pay attention to this point.
Making the cost of production competitive is important and it is necessary to pay attention to it.
These are the things that must be done and it is not just the government that is responsible in this regard.
The executive branch, the Majlis, different managerial organizations, the private sector, the people and those who can improve the culture of our society through their words - they should all be at the service of national production.
If we succeed, I assure you that we will strike a serious blow to our blood-thirsty enemies.
Production-based policies, promoting the culture of consuming domestic products, improving the quality of domestic products, modernization of production equipment, and innovative products, management and production - these are the things that must be done and I hope by Allah's favor, they will be taken care of.
I apologize to the friends and the brothers and sisters who sat in the sun in this hot weather and listened to my statements.
I hope that by Allah's favor, you will live an enjoyable and happy life.
Leader's Hajj Message - Khamenei.ir Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, delivered a message to this year's hajj pilgrims.
The following is the full text of this message issued on October 11, 2013.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds and peace and greetings be upon the Master of Prophets and Messengers and upon his immaculate and pure household and chosen companions.
The arrival of the hajj season should be regarded as the great Eid of the Islamic Ummah.
The great opportunity which these precious days provide for Muslims throughout the world is like a miraculous elixir. If the value of such days is appreciated and if we benefit from such days in an appropriate way, many of the maladies of the world of Islam will be cured.
Hajj is the bubbling spring of divine blessings.
Each and every one of you happy pilgrims has gained the opportunity to cleanse your hearts and souls with these religious practices, which are full of warmth and spirituality, and to collect many blessings for your entire life by using this source of mercy, dignity and power.
In this divine arena of self-edification you can express your humility before Allah the Merciful, carry out the responsibilities which have fallen on the shoulders of Muslims, show enthusiasm and dynamism in the affairs of the world and in your religious duties, offer mercy and forgiveness when you interact with Muslim brothers, demonstrate your courage and determination in the face of difficult events, become hopeful about divine assistance in all arenas and, finally, build your human character the way Muslims should.
When you are ornamented with these precious resources and when you have benefitted from them, then you can offer yourselves as gifts to your country, your nation and the Islamic Ummah.
More than anything else, the Islamic Ummah needs individuals who can utilize thoughts and actions as well as faith, sincerity and purity, who can show resistance in the face of the spiteful enemies as well as exercising self-purification and piety.
This is the only way for the liberation of the great Muslim community from the problems which have been created, either by the enemy, or as a result ofthe lack of determination, faith and foresightamong Muslims. Muslims have suffered from these things for a very long time.
It is exactly in such conditions that our determination- which is based on faith, reliance on God, foresight and wisdom- can help Muslim nations achieve victory against these challenges and bring about a dignified and honorable fate for Muslims.
The opposing camp which cannot tolerate Islamic Awakening and the dignity of Muslims has entered the arena with all its power and it is using all kinds of psychological, military, security, economic and propaganda tools to suppress Muslims, make them inactive and busy them with trivial things.
Taking a general look at the conditions of West Asian countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and countries surrounding the Persian Gulf, and North African countries such as Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan and a number of other countries- reveals many truths.
The existence of civil wars, religious and denominational prejudices and political instabilities, the prevalence of cruel terrorism, the emergence of extreme groups and orientations- which like savage tribes in history, cut open the chests of human beings and rip their hearts out with their teeth- the emergence of armed mercenaries who kill women and children, cut off the heads of men and rape women and who do such horrible and disgusting crimes in the name of religion are all the products of the satanic and arrogant plots of foreign intelligence services and their regional agents. Such plots are implemented in countries in which the ground is prepared before-hand and as a result, they create a disastrous situation for these nations and peoples.
In such conditions, it is clear that one cannot expect Muslim nations to remedy their material and spiritual shortcomings and to achieve security, welfare, scientific progress and international dignity which are the results of achieving awakening and finding one's true identity.
These disastrous conditions can abort the progress of Islamic Awakening, destroy the mental awareness which has been created in the world of Islam, drag Muslims- once more- towards stagnation, isolation and decline and consign to oblivion important and fundamental issues such as the liberation of Palestine and other Muslim nations from the transgressions of the USA and Zionism.
The most important cure for this situation can be summarized in two key phrases, both of which are among the clearest lessons of hajj:
First: unity and brotherhood of Muslims under the flag of monotheism.
Second: knowing the enemy and confronting his plans and methods.
Strengthening the spirit of brotherhood and cooperation is a great lesson of hajj.
During hajj, even quarrelling and arguing with others is forbidden.
During hajj, wearing the same clothes, following the same practices, making the same moves and behaving in a kind way,all mean equality and brotherhood for all those who believe in and rely on monotheism.
This means that Islam strongly rejects any idea and belief which views a number of Muslims and believers in Ka'bah and monotheism as people who are outside the circle of Islam.
Theseorientationswhich are based on takfirism, which have become playthings in the hands of the treacherous Zionist politicians and their western supporters- commit serious crimes and shed the blood of Muslims and innocent people, and the people who claim to be religious, who call themselves clerics and who fuel the fire of fitna between Shia and Sunni and otherdenominations- should know that the hajj pilgrimage will thwart their claims.
I, like many Islamic scholars and sympathetic personalities in the Islamic Ummah, announce that any statement or action which fuels the fire of discord among Muslims, any insult to the sacred beliefs of each one of the Muslim denominations and any act of takfirism against Islamic denominations equals serving the camp of atheism and polytheism and betraying Islam.
Knowing the enemy and its methods is the second important factor.
First, we should not forget about the existence of a spiteful enemy.
Performing the ritual of the stoning of the jamarat during hajj is a symbolic sign of this awareness.
Second, we should not make a mistake in knowing the main enemy, who in the present time is global arrogance and the criminal Zionist network.
Third, we should properly identify the methods of this hostile enemy which is creating discord among Muslims, promoting moral and political corruption, threatening and tempting outstanding personalities, exerting economic pressures on all nations and arousing doubts about Islamic beliefs. Moreover, we should identify their agents and those who are, knowingly or ignorantly, dependent on them.
Arrogant governments, headed by the USA, conceal their true character with the help of comprehensive and advanced propaganda tools. By claiming that they support human rights and democracy, they deceive public opinion in different countries.
They speak about the rights of all nations while each day Muslim nations feel- with their bodies and souls- the fire of discord more than the past. For decades, the oppressed Palestinian nation has been receiving strikes as a result of the crimes of the Zionist regime and its supporters. In the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, terrorism - which originates from the policies of global arrogance and its agents in the region - has ruined the lives of the people.
Political, cultural and religious personalities throughout the world of Islam should consider it their responsibility to draw everyone's attention to these facts.
This is the moral and religious responsibility of all of us.
North African countries, which are unfortunately suffering from deep domestic conflicts today, should pay attention to this responsibility more than other countries. They should pay more attention to the issue of knowing the enemy and its plots and methods.
The continuation of these conflicts among nationalist orientations and Muslims' negligence about the threat of domestic wars in such countries is a great danger. The loss that may be inflicted on the Islamic Ummah because of such events will not be quickly compensated for.
Of course, we have no doubts that the people who have risen against global arrogance and who have become the embodiment of Islamic Awakening in such countries will not, by Allah's favor, allow time to go back so much so that the era of the corrupt, dependent and dictatorial rulers starts again.
We believe, from the bottom of our hearts, in the capability of nations and in the power, faith, determination and foresight which Allah the Omniscient has offered to the masses of the people.
For more than three decades, we have seen this in the Islamic Republic with our own eyes and we have experienced it with all our hearts and souls.
Our determination is an invitation forall Muslim nations, to this experience of their brothers in this dignified and indefatigable country.
I ask Allah the Exalted to bestow peace on Muslims and to foil the plots of the enemies.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
The following is the full text of the message issued on March 20, 2014 by Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, on the occasion of Norouz.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
O Conqueror of hearts and sight, O Planner of night and day,
Allah, Your blessings be upon Fatimah, her father, her husband and her children.
Allah, be for Your representative, the Hujjat, son of al-Hasan, Your blessings be on him and his forefathers, in this hour and in every hour, a guardian, a protector, a leader, a helper, a proof, and a watchful eye until you make him reside on the earth, in obedience (to You), and cause him to live in it for a long time.
Allah, hasten his re-appearance and place us among his companions, his supporters and his Shia.
I would like to offer my congratulations to all my dear fellow countrymen throughout Iran and to all the Iranians who live in different parts of the world â€“ particularly to the esteemed families of martyrs, to disabled war veterans, to their spouses and to all those people who have made and continue to make efforts on the path of Islam and Iran and who have shouldered and continue to shoulder different responsibilities â€“ on the occasion of the arrival of the new year.
I would like to extend my congratulations to all the nations who honor Norouz and who hold it in high esteem.
This year, the arrival of the new year coincides with the two narrations of the Fatemiyyahs and the martyrdom anniversary of the great lady of the world of Islam, Saddiqat al-Kubra (s.a.).
By Allah's favor, this coincidence will help our people to benefit from the blessings of Fatemi enlightenment, to place themselves in the radius of the teachings of that great personality and to enlighten themselves with the light of divine guidance which has been bestowed upon all the people throughout the world through Fatimah Zahra- Allah's greetings upon her- and the Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.a.s.) household.
The passage of different years should both be an experience and a source of foresight for us.
We should learn from the past and we should look to the future and make decisions for it with open eyes and with wise hearts.
I ask Allah the Exalted to bestow health, enthusiasm, psychological security, peace of mind, progress, transcendence and happiness on our dear Iranians in this new year.
I hope that He bestows enthusiasm and dynamism on our youth. I hope that He bestows firm determination and willpower on our men and women so that they can take glorious paths. I hope that He bestows happiness and health on our children and I hope that He bestows security, kindness and compassion on our families.
Our responsibility is to look to the past in order to learn a lesson and to look to the future for making plans and taking decisions.
It was announced that last year was â€œThe Year of Political and Economic Valorâ€.
Thankfully, political valor was achieved â€“ in the best way possible - in different arenas including the arena of elections, great rallies, the presence of the people in different areas and the efforts that were made by both officials and the people throughout the year.
This was done with tranquility and utmost security in the country and thankfully a new link in the long chain of the management of the country was created.
But on the issue of economic valor, what should have been done and what was expected to be done was not done.
Certain efforts were made which are appreciated, but the great task that should be carried out in the arena of economic valor is still ahead of us. We are responsible for achieving this epic.
The issue of economy is an important issue for our country and our people. Thankfully, a theoretical infrastructure was designed for economic valor and the policies on the economy of resistance were announced at the end of the year 1392.
From the viewpoint of this humble person, there are two issues which are more important than anything else in our outlook towards the year 1393. One is the issue of economy and the other is the issue of culture.
What is expected in both arenas and areas is a collaborative effort by the officials of the country and the people.
What is expected to be done in order to build life and the future cannot be done without the people's cooperation.
Therefore, in addition to the officials' management, the presence of the people in both arenas â€“ the arena of economy and the arena of culture - is necessary and fundamental.
Without the presence of the people, the task at hand will not be carried out and the goal will not be achieved.
The people in various public groupings can play a role with firm determination and with national willpower.
They should do this both in the arena of the economy and culture.
God willing, I will explain all these issues to the people of Iran in the speech that I will deliver next Friday.
So, I think what is ahead of us in this new year is an economy that will blossom with the help of officials and the people and a culture that can determine the direction of the great movement of our country and our people with the determination of officials and the people.
This is why I have named this year â€œThe Year of Economy and Culture with National Determination and Jihadi Managementâ€.
I hope that Allah the Exalted will help both the people and the honorable officials to carry out their responsibilities in this area.
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met today with a group of students, scholars, and teachers of Islamic seminaries.
Speaking at the meeting, the Leader said that some people violated the law and created uproar after the presidential election. "As a result of these acts, the enemy was emboldened to the extent that it insulted Imam Khomeini (r.a.) in front of many students who are committed to our magnanimous Imam, the Revolution, and the Islamic Republic."
He further reiterated: "This great insult was the result of post-election violations of the law and dependence on the encouragement of foreign media.
And now that these mistakes have already been made, they have resorted to sophistry and faulty reasoning in order to cover up their mistakes."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that such sophistry is the main cause of fitna and public confusion.
They shout slogans in support of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), but their actions caused this great sin against Imam Khomeini (r.a.)." His Eminence added that those who promote the principles of Islam, the Revolution, and Imam Khomeini (r.a.) will immediately change their path and rectify their ways as soon as they realize that their movement and statements work against these principles.
But why are these gentlemen not chastened yet?
He reiterated: "When Islam is deleted from the central slogan of the Islamic Republic - that is, 'independence, freedom, Islamic Republic' - these gentlemen should wake up to reality and realize that they are treading the wrong path. When slogans are shouted against Palestine and in support of the usurping Zionist regime on Quds Day, these gentlemen should be chastened, and they should distance themselves from this movement."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "Why do they not realize that they have been wrong when they are supported by the leaders of oppression and arrogance - embodied by America, France, and England.
Why do they not realize that they have been treading the wrong path when exiled monarchists and corrupt people support them?"
Open your eyes and distance yourselves from this movement. 0.357787 274.txt 1223-Leader-Slams-Violations-of-Law.txt Shin ana iya rufe idanuwa daga wadannan ababe da suka fito fili ta hanyar fakewa da batun amfani da hankali. Is it possible to ignore these clear realities under the pretext of rationality? 0.229265 274.txt 1223-Leader-Slams-Violations-of-Law.txt Rufe ido kan wadannan hakika, shi ne ma kishiyar amfani da hankali. Ignoring these realities is the opposite of rationality, the Leader noted.
His Eminence said that some followers of the path of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Revolution deviated from the path of the late Imam (r.a.) during his lifetime and caused him to renounce them. He added: "We should learn lessons from such events.
Of course, as I said in my Friday prayer sermons, I believe in maximum inclusion and minimum purging of opponents. But some people insist on distancing themselves from the system." The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the few people who have been encouraged, by the words and actions of a particular group of people, to oppose the Islamic Republic are nothing compared to the greatness of the Iranian nation and reiterated: "The Islamic Republic is a divine system, and Allah the Exalted has bestowed His support and blessings on the Islamic Republic on numerous occasions during the past thirty years.
Therefore, if we follow the path of God, He will undoubtedly help us."
Ayatollah Khamenei further stressed that the enemies of the Islamic Republic and the global domineering powers that are trying to use faulty reasoning to dominate the world will be defeated by the Iranian nation as well as other independent nations of the world.
The Leader of the Islamic Republic referred to the wrath of different groups of people following the recent insult to Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and described the reaction of the people as appropriate.
He further stressed: "Everyone should stay calm and know that those who are opposed to the nation have no roots and will be wiped out by the grandeur of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Revolution."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the law enforcement officials of the country will fulfill their duties when necessary and added: "Of course students have to identify the sources of corruption and introduce them to others. But everything has to be done in a peaceful atmosphere."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the enemies of the Iranian nation are like "bubbles on water" which will finally fade away. "And what will remain at the end is the Islamic Republic," he noted.
He added: "On the basis of which law is the US government continuing its occupation of Iraq and increasing the number of its troops in Afghanistan every day?"
Leader Meets Khaled Meshaal - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this afternoon with Khaled Meshaal, the political leader of Hamas, and his accompanying delegation. Speaking at the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran will not change its stance on the Palestinian issue. The Leader expressed his appreciation for the resistance of the Palestinian people and Palestinian resistance groups, including Hamas.
He further reiterated that resistance, reliance on God, and taking action are the three factors which can help Palestinians achieve victory. His Eminence said that the future is promising for the Palestinian people despite all the hardships and the crimes and atrocities which are committed against them.
He added: "God has promised that the ultimate victory belongs to those who believe in Him and engage in jihad on His path."
Ayatollah Khamenei further stated that there are two aspects to the events happening in Palestine and referred to these events as one of the greatest events of history. He further added: "One aspect of these events is the resistance of the Palestinian people in the face of the greatest pressures, and the other aspect is the betrayal of some so-called Arab Muslims towards the Palestinian people."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the resistance of Hamas leaders against pressures, threats, and political games as very valuable and stated: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the issue of Palestine as a domestic issue and views supporting the Palestinian people as a religious and Islamic duty."
His Eminence referred to the efforts of the enemies to lead the Islamic Republic of Iran towards adopting an indifferent stance on the issue of Palestine and added: "They have made every effort to achieve this goal, but their efforts have proven futile."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the issue of Palestine is one of the main reasons for the enmity of the global arrogant powers towards the Islamic Republic. He further stated that such enmity would have been greatly reduced if the Islamic Republic had changed its stance on the Palestinian issue.
But the Islamic Republic will stand firm in this regard and will never change its current position, he noted.
His Eminence said that finding an appropriate solution for the issue of Palestine will help solve many of the problems of the Islamic Ummah.
He further referred to the recent threats of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people and added: "If the Zionist regime starts another war against the people of Gaza, it will receive an even harder blow in the mouth this time.
In this meeting, Khaled Meshaal expressed his appreciation for the supportive stance of the Leader and the Iranian nation and government towards the Palestinian people.
He also presented a report on the latest conditions of Gaza and the West Bank, further adding: "Resistance is a strategic decision which has been made by Hamas, the resistance forces, and the Palestinian people.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on May 1, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, in a meeting with a group of panegyrists on the occasion of the birthday anniversary of Fatima Zahra (s.a.).
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I congratulate all of you dear people and dear brothers and sisters, who are the nightingales of the garden of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and who eulogize the best people in the world, on the occasion of this noble Eid, this auspicious birthday anniversary and this day of happiness and joy of the hearts of all Shia Muslims throughout history.
I hope that Allah the Exalted will thoroughly approve of the program that was presented by you dear people including vocalists, presenters and all of you dear people.
Perhaps, it is around 30 years or more that we have been holding these meetings on such a day and we can, thankfully, see the flourishing, the magnificence and the spiritual growth of concepts in these meetings.
This year, the program that you presented was very good both in terms of content and form.
Today the network of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) panegyrists and eulogists has, thankfully, developed in the entire country.
Thankfully, a large number of panegyrists - who are comprised of our youth, our experienced panegyrists and our professors - with many capabilities and with enthusiastic hearts go among the people and help them get close to God and benefit from the blessings of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
This is an opportunity for our country, just like many other opportunities that we have.
Our Muslim brothers in other countries do not have many of these opportunities.
This is one of them. This movement and this network, through which we get close to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and their kindness and through which we inspire feelings, are great opportunities. For any reason, other people in other areas in the world do not benefit from this great blessing, which is for all people, in such a way.
The prophets and divine messengers did not use philosophical language with the people although adopting a philosophical approach was and still is necessary for fully understanding their words.
Great philosophers obtained the maximum benefit from the widely shared blessings of the divine prophets.
However, these blessings are not particular to specific people.
This language was a combination of reason and feelings.
We naturally benefit from such a process both in mourning ceremonies, festive occasions and in meetings in which eulogies, mouloodis and duas are performed.
Thankfully, these are privileges which the followers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household benefit from.
These things have combined reason with feelings in the mind of humanity throughout history.
This is the role of a panegyrist.
The role of a panegyrist and a eulogist - a profession which is thankfully popular in our country today - is that he should promote knowledge and understanding among the people through artistic methods and means of expression.
This is the main factor. The poetry and tone that you choose and the way you speak with the people should be orientated towards increasing people's knowledge and deepening their understanding of religion and life.
I have said many times - and this is a fact - that when you recite a ghazal or qasida which contains important points, this sometimes has a deeper effect than when a person delivers a speech for many hours in an articulate and eloquent way.
This is an opportunity.
You should use this opportunity.
This opportunity should not be wasted.
If your performance is delivered in a way that it oversteps the boundaries of sharia, then this opportunity will be wasted. If it ignores the fundamental things which the people need to know today, this opportunity will be wasted. Imagine that during the Sacred Defense Era when the country was in need of enthusiastic valor in jihad and in practical arenas, somebody attends a meeting and he recites a poem in a good way in the presence of youth and fathers and mothers, but if he does not mention the needs of the time, he has wasted the opportunity.
In those days, panegyrists played a very good role.
During the Sacred Defense Era, the things which our panegyrists did and the influence that they exerted on the hearts and souls of our soldiers were exceptional.
Today when I take a look at you, I see that you paid attention to fundamental things in the poems that you recited in this meeting.
An example of this is the poem that Mr. Sazegar recited. It is the same every year.
He slowly and artistically begins from spiritual concepts until he reaches the needs of the time.
Notice that what he does is an artistic combination. The poems that he recites are also good. You use your throats which are a divine blessing.
You use poetry and the capability to compose poetry is a divine blessing.
These blessings are available to you. How do you use these blessings?
You use them in order to increase knowledge and understanding.
As a result of these conflicts, biased and obstinate people in certain areas in the world behead other people in large numbers. You should be careful about this. Considering the fact that today there is video, Internet and different other means of communication, you should take care not to recite a kind of poem which provokes some biased and dim-witted people - after they hear about your poem - into shedding the blood of a group of innocent women and children.
This is the reason why I insist and stress so much that you should avoid sectarian and tribal conflicts.
Nobody should imagine that this is the way to express their gratitude for the blessed love of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household which has, thankfully, filled the hearts of our people. Nobody should imagine that this is the way to engender feelings in the heart of the people. This is wrong.
Creating discord or provoking conflicts which will result in discord are not to the benefit of our country. Neither today nor during the time of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) was it a proper move.
However, some superficial people do not pay attention to this issue.
The same is true of domestic conflicts.
Today our people should have hopes.
If there is hope, there will be valor.
It is not the case that we should order the people to achieve valor.
Is this possible?
Valor originates from the heart.
It is guided by reason and it is reinforced with faith.
Will valor be achieved if we create doubts in the minds of the people and inject despair into their hearts? It is obvious that it will not be achieved in such a way.
For example, 30 years ago in the early years of the 1360s if we had said that the future will be bright, perhaps some people would have said that we were fixing these ideas in the minds of the people.
But today nobody says such things. Today we can see the widespread and ongoing movement of the Revolution and the country towards goals - including material, spiritual, political, social, domestic and international goals.
These goals are being achieved in front of our eyes. Can anybody deny this?
Continuous jihad does not mean suffering. Jihad causes excitement.
If today that we need jihad somebody guides the people towards laziness, isolation and inaction, they have behaved in a blasphemous way towards divine blessings.
Have you not seen those who have changed Allah's favor for ungratefulness and made their people to alight into the abode of perdition [The Holy Quran, 14: 28].
Among you dear people there are, thankfully, both experienced and young panegyrists. You have good capacities.
Among you I can see fresh and newly-budded flowers who have managed to successfully enter the arena.
Not only have you managed to replace previous panegyrists - we have seen many of the panegyrists who were active in the past - but you have also moved forward better than they did.
What I want to tell you is that eulogy increases knowledge and understanding.
Eulogy sows the seeds of knowledge and understanding, acumen, hope and firm beliefs.
Eulogy engenders feelings in the hearts of the people with the art of poetry and performance.
Of course, my dear ones, there is a basic principle.
If you win praise from the people by behaving in a moral, religious and modest way, all the things that I spoke about will deeply influence the people.
But if, God forbid, the opposite happens, if the people witness signs of moral instability, moral backwardness and, God forbid, immorality and other such things, then the effect of the art and the beauties which exist in your work will be minimized. You should be careful about this. All of us should be careful.
Everybody, including you, should be careful. You who are involved in the arena of religion and religious understanding should be very careful.
You should be careful about your morality and your purity of tongue, heart and hands.
May Allah the Exalted help you.
When a panegyrist of Fatima Zahra (s.a.) achieves such a position, he is an outstanding man.
As we have known, understood and believed, those who tread the path of eulogizing the Imams (a.s.), expressing love for Fatima Zahra (s.a.) and attracting hearts to these great personalities are dear to Allah the Exalted.
Today, there was an outstanding point in our meeting which is praiseworthy.
They used to perform rowza and make the people shed tears.
What does panegyrist mean?
Your main characteristic is praising, not performing rowza. You can perform rowza.
When a mouloodi is performed for the Imams (a.s.), it should not be mixed with a rowza to make the people shed tears. This is not at all necessary.
You should not do something to make outsiders promote the idea that our people's emotions towards the Imams (a.s.) are only centered around shedding tears and mourning.
They should not be mixed.
And the second point which should be discussed today is the issue of women.
One of the sins that western civilization committed is the movement that they launched on the issue of women.
We have many things to say in this regard.
Like everything else, they give this movement different names. They commit crimes, but they refer to it as measures to defend human rights.
They launch attacks, but they call it defense.
The characteristics of western civilization are deceitfulness, hypocrisy, dishonesty and contradiction between words and actions.
Unfortunately, they have established their culture throughout the world.
They have acted in a way that today one of the most important responsibilities or the most important responsibility of women is to put themselves on display and put their beauty at the service of men's pleasure.
Unfortunately, the world has become like this.
In the most formal meetings, such as political meetings and different other meetings, men should wear long pants and modest clothes, but if women appear as nude as they can, it is alright. Is this normal? Is this natural?
Women should put themselves on display and they should become objects of pleasure for men. Is there a kind of oppression which is worse than this?
They call this freedom and they call the opposite behavior restriction.
The first consequence or perhaps one of the first consequences of this behavior was that the family was destroyed and undermined.
When the family is undermined and destroyed in a society, corruption will be established in that society.
The problems that exist in the west today and the dim-witted and malevolent laws that they pass on sexual issues will push them off the precipice.
This fall is not preventable. They are condemned to destruction.
Whether they like it or not, western civilization cannot prevent this fall.
The brakes of the vehicle of western civilization have failed and the path which it is treading is slippery.
They committed a sin when they caused this brake failure and when they stood at the edge of the precipice. They are condemned to failure. The fall of civilizations as well as their rise happens gradually.
And this gradual fall of western civilization is taking place. I do not think that this generation or the next generation will miss witnessing this.
They will see what will happen.
In the Holy Quran, Allah the Exalted has mentioned how much women should be respected.
There is no difference between men and women in terms of spiritual and divine position.
This path has been created for human beings, not only for men or for women.
Allah the Exalted has created a woman like Fatima Zahra (s.a.) about whom Imam Askari (a.s.) or Imam Hadi (a.s.) say, "We are the representatives of Allah among the people and Fatima is representative of Allah among us."
She was infallible.
And such a person was a woman.
Great women such as Mary, Sara, Asiya and many other great women are the outstanding personalities of the world.
There is no difference between men and women in terms of social rights.
There is no difference between men and women in terms of individual rights.
This is Islam. It has the most reasonable, the most dignified and the most practical laws that one can ever imagine regarding the issue of gender.
We should follow this path.
One of the major ways to do this is to raise a family, safeguard the family environment and preserve love in the family.
And this is the responsibility of the lady of the house.
The mother can raise children in the best way possible.
She raises and teaches them with her behavior, with her words and with her feelings. She teaches them by stroking, by singing lullabies and by living with them.
Mothers teach children by living with them.
The more righteous, the more intelligent and the wiser women are, the better children will be raised and taught.
Therefore, there should be careful planning in our country to improve women's level of faith, literacy and intelligence.
One of the most important responsibilities of women is being a homemaker.
As everybody knows, I do not believe that women should not have social and political roles.
But if this means that we should look down on homemaker, then we have committed a sin. Homemaking is a job.
It is a great, important and sensitive job which builds the future.
I have said to our people many times that the consequences of aging and a reduction in the number of young people in our country will show themselves later on.
But today, it can be cured.
Giving birth is one of the feminine efforts and responsibilities.
Giving birth to children is, in fact, the art of women.
It is they whom Allah the Exalted has offered the means for raising children.
Allah the Exalted has not provided men with the means for raising children.
He has given them the patience, the feelings, the emotions and the body which are necessary to raise children.
This is, in fact, the art of women.
If we do not let these things pass into oblivion, then we will make progress.
One issue is that we should respect women and this issue should receive careful attention.
The behavior of women in the family environment, in the workplace and in political and social environments is also an important issue. The way we should behave towards women is another issue.
It is men who are addressed by this statement, whether men in the family - including fathers, brothers and husbands - or men in work environments.
It is necessary to behave towards women in a respectful, loving, noble and moral way.
Therefore, respect for women, the responsibility of women and our responsibility towards women are issues which should be considered separately and we should develop separate plans for them.
Mother's Day and Women's Day - which have, fortunately, coincided with the birthday anniversary of Fatima Zahra (s.a.), the chosen woman in the entire creation - should draw everybody's attention to these points.
If we manage to think , decide and act in the right way on the issue of family and women - as mothers and wives - then you should know that the future of the country will be guaranteed.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Change our condition to the best of conditions.
Greetings be upon Siddiqat al-Tahirah, Fatimah al-Marziah, the Holy Prophet’s (God’s greetings be upon him and his household) daughter.
And greetings be upon Allah’s Great Representative (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake and may God hasten his reappearance)
I would like to congratulate all Iranian families and each and every Iranian - wherever they are in the world - on the occasion of Norouz.
In particular, I would like to congratulate the dear families of the martyrs, the dear disabled war veterans, their honorable families and all self-sacrificing individuals, and I commemorate the memory of our great martyrs and our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
The year that has just begun – the year 1395 – is blessed with the auspicious name of Hazrat Zahra (s.a.) both in its beginning and in its end.
Both the beginning and the end of this year are marked by the birthday anniversary of that great personality – corresponding with the lunar months.
Therefore, I hope that God willing, the year 1395 will be an auspicious year for the people of Iran by the blessedness of Hazrat Zahra (s.a.) and that we will learn lessons and benefit from the spirituality, instructions and life of that great personality.
All years and days of one’s life include opportunities and threats.
Our skill lies in benefiting from opportunities and turning threats into opportunities.
The year 1395 is ahead of us.
In this year as always, there are both opportunities and threats.
Everyone should make efforts so that we can benefit from the opportunities of this year in the real sense of the word and so that at the end of the year, the country will witness a tangible difference compared to the beginning of the year.
There are certain hopes for the year 1395.
When one looks at the prospects and the circumstances, one witnesses certain hopes.
We should work day and night and try hard in a ceaseless manner.
The main point is that the people of Iran should do something to liberate themselves from vulnerabilities in the face of the enemies’ threats and enmities.
We should do something to avoid being vulnerable in the face of the enemies’ threats. We should reduce our vulnerability to zero. I believe that the issue of the economy is the first priority.
When we take a look at priorities, we see that the issue of the economy is the most urgent and essential one.
If the people, the administration and different officials can – by Allah’s favor – adopt correct, timely and proper measures, then we can hope that this will influence other issues – such as social maladies and moral and cultural issues – as well.
On the issue of the economy, what is important and fundamental is the issue of domestic production, the issue of employment and eliminating unemployment, the issue of economic dynamism and the issue of combating recession. These are the issues that people are faced with.
These are the things that people feel and demand.
The statistics and statements of the officials themselves show that these demands and requests of the people are legitimate and sensible.
If we want to resolve the problem of recession, domestic production and unemployment and if we want to manage the issue of inflation, the cure for all these things lie in the framework of economic resistance and the economy of resistance. The economy of resistance includes all these problems.
With the economy of resistance, we can fight against unemployment, we can fight against recession, we can manage inflation, we can stand up against the enemy’s threats and we can create and benefit from many opportunities for the country. The condition is that effort is made on the path of the economy of resistance.
This is what constitutes our responsibility. By Allah’s favor, I will discuss this issue in detail with our dear people during the [Mashhad] speech.
Thus, the name that I want to choose for this year is, “The Economy of Resistance: Action and Implementation”.
The economy of resistance, action and implementation- this is a straight and enlightened path and the road towards what we need.
Of course, we do not expect that this action and implementation will solve all the problems in the course of one year, but we are sure that if action and implementation is carried out in a systematic and correct manner, we will be able to witness the results at the end of the year.
I thank all those people who worked and continue to work hard on this path.
And I ask God to bestow His peace and blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), on his household and on the Imam of the Age (God’s greetings be upon him and may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Imam Khamenei Meets with Family of Shahid Rajab Mohammadzade - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met Sunday morning with the family of Shahid Rajab Mohammadzade - a disabled war veteran [with severe facial disfiguration due to war injuries] who recently achieved martyrdom.
Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence praised the lofty and desirable station of Shahid Mohammadzade, saying: “Over the course of these years, every moment and every hour during which this dear shahid endured pain and difficulties resulting from his disability will be recorded and rewarded by Allah the Exalted.
Praising the high morale, self-sacrifice and patience of Shahid Mohammadzade’s family- particularly his spouse- the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: “You families of martyrs are the embodiment of the Islamic Revolution and our morale is boosted when we see you dear ones.” Ayatollah Khamenei also stressed the necessity of promoting the biographies of resistant and great men like Shahid Mohammadzade.
In the year 1366, he was severely injured in the area of the head and face following a mortar attack.
He met with Ayatollah Khamenei in the month of Farvardin of the year 1394 during the Supreme Leader’s visit to the Holy Shrine of Imam Ridha (a.s.) where he was warmly received by His Eminence.
Leader’s Speech to Government Officials on Mab’ath - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on June 30, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to congratulate the honorable audience, our esteemed government officials, the honorable ambassadors of Islamic countries, all dear Iranian people, the great Islamic Ummah and the entire humanity on this great Eid and this holy day.
If the importance of a particular day depends on whether or not Allah the Exalted has bestowed a blessing on humanity on that day, then Mab'ath is definitely the greatest and the most important day of the year.
This is because sending down the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) for humanity was greater than all divine blessings throughout history.
Therefore, one can say with certainty that Mab'ath is the best, the greatest and the most auspicious day of the year.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said, "God sent the Prophet when the mission of other Prophets had stopped and the peoples were in slumber for a long time." Be'that happened at a time when humanity had been deprived of the presence of divine prophets for a long time. It was about 600 years after Jesus Christ.
Humanity had not seen a divine messenger for hundreds of years.
What was the result?
Allah the Exalted sent the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) in such a situation.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was the person who had been prepared by Allah the Exalted for such a great mission in the entire history of mankind.
Therefore, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) managed to start a movement in 23 years, and this movement has pushed human history forward in spite of all the problems.
Twenty three years is a short time, and 13 years of it were spent in unfair battles.
Later on Allah the Exalted prepared the way for the immigration of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) to Medina, and he managed to establish this Islamic system and this civilization in Medina.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) organized, built and managed this system in only ten years. It was a short time.
Such events usually disappear in the flood of other important events, and they are usually forgotten.
Ten years is a very short time. But the Holy Prophet managed to plant, water and nurture this sapling in that period of time. He managed to start a movement that led to a civilization, and this civilization stood at the peak of human civilization during a certain period.
That is to say, during the 3rd and 4th centuries of the Hijri calendar, Islamic civilization was greater than all earlier civilizations.
This is one of the miracles of Islam.
In spite of all these things, in spite of the deviations that emerged over time, in spite of the impurities that appeared and grew, the Holy Prophet of Islam and the message of Be'that managed to give rise to that greatness in 3, 4 centuries, and the modern world and all civilizations of the modern world are indebted to Islamic civilization of the 3rd and 4th Hijri centuries.
If humanity considered the issue in a fair way, it would acknowledge that human beings' salvation and their movement towards perfection will be possible only through Islam.
We were ungrateful, and we paid the price. Islam has the capacity to help humanity achieve prosperity and perfection.
The foundations that were established by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) - faith, rationality, struggle and dignity - are the main foundations of an Islamic community.
When these things are revived in a society, that society will definitely follow the path of Islam and the path of the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.).
Thanks to the message of Islam and thanks to the call of our magnanimous Imam, we Iranian people managed to practice part of these things in our life, and we can see the positive results. Today the world of Islam has awakened.
The movements that we see today in certain North African and Middle Eastern countries are the result of using the light of Islam and following the guidance of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Therefore, by Allah's grace, the future of this region and these countries is bright.
What we see today in Egypt, Tunisia and certain other countries tell us that a new chapter has begun in the history of this region.
The wrong and oppressive balance that western arrogant and colonial powers established in this region 100-150 years ago and imposed it on the destiny of this great and strategic region, has been upset. A new chapter has begun.
Of course today western arrogant powers are resisting. They do not want to accept the great and undeniable fact that the regional nations have awakened.
The Islamic spirit has been revived in Muslim countries.
The puppets of America and the west did something that these nations had no option but to rise up, start an impressive popular movement and carry out a revolution. Therefore, they started following this path. These movements will definitely achieve the desired outcome.
Of course westerners are making a lot of efforts.
Today all propaganda, political and economic organizations of America and some of its mercenaries in the region are trying to derail these popular revolutions and these great uprisings. They are trying to hide and deny the Islamic aspect of these movements. They are trying to deceive the people and install individuals who would help them change all the equations in favor of the west again.
They are trying to do these things, but their efforts are futile. Nations have awakened.
When a nation awakens, when a nation enters the arena in a courageous way, it is not possible to dissuade or deceive it.
We hope that the path of the Muslim nations that have revolted - and those nations that have the potential to revolt - will be continued and that this path will become as short as possible.
The end result is certain although the path might be long or short. Today the Americans are trying to derail these revolutions with the help of the Zionists and some of their allies and mercenaries in the region.
These problems are natural.
Therefore, these problems exist. Today you see that they create internal disputes in Egypt and other places.
The solution is to awaken the people and prominent figures - scientific and political figures and empathetic government officials who care about the destiny of their country. They should be vigilant.
They should be careful, and by Allah's favor, the work will be continued in the best possible way.
This is the manifestation of the continuation of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) be'that and the prophetic movement.
Oppressed nations are after their dignity, the same dignity that was one of the pillars of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) call to Islam.
Enemies, arrogant powers, occupiers and interferers exploited Muslim nations for many years. They also humiliated Muslim nations.
When a nation enjoys the blessing of Islam, it will be after dignity.
This is the Islamic movement.
This is what the Islamic movement means.
They should not keep themselves busy with pointless and unimportant disputes.
We Iranian people are happy to see that Muslim nations are after their freedom and dignity.
Since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the positions of the Revolution have been clear on regional issues, regional movements and regional uprisings.
Wherever a movement is opposed to the arrogant powers, Zionism and the usurping Zionist regime, we support that movement.
Wherever a movement is against America, against America's international dictatorship - against domestic dictators, wherever a movement seeks to claim national rights, we support that movement. Everybody should be vigilant. We should be vigilant, and other nations should also be vigilant.
They should know that the plots of the enemies are diverse and complex.
We should consider insight as the criterion for our work.
Nations should pay attention to the fact that the Americans, the Zionists and their allies and mercenaries are trying to derail the revolutions. They focus their attention on the countries that have awakened. They do whatever they can to derail the movement of these nations.
The oppressed Bahraini nation is like the Egyptian nation, the Tunisian nation and the Yemeni nation. They are all in the same situation. It is meaningless to distinguish between the movements of these nations.
Unfortunately we see that instead of paying attention to what nations want, some people follow the path and make the move that the enemies of these nations want.
Today in order to simulate what was done in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya and other such countries, America has realized that it should create problems for Syria - which is moving on the path of resistance.
The nature of the issue in Syria is different from the nature of the issue in these countries.
In these countries, the movements were anti-America and anti-Zionism, but America is clearly involved in Syria. The Zionists are following up the issue.
We should not make a mistake.
We should not forget our standard.
We will preserve this logic and this insight.
Of course we know that the enemies of the Islamic Republic will get angry and will increase their machinations against us.
We have resisted in the face of these machinations.
The Iranian nation has resisted in the face of different kinds of machinations over the past 30 years.
They pin their hopes on certain events that happen in the country. Fortunately different organizations are doing their duty with hope and enthusiasm today. You see how much work has been done in the country during the recent years.
We used to import oil products, but we turned into a country that exports these products. Thankfully the country is active in different areas.
The mutual attempt by the administration and the Majlis to downsize the government is a very important and great measure. These things should be followed up, and by Allah's favor, they will be.
By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation and government officials will manage to turn the hope of the enemies of the Iranian nation into despair through their resistance, unity, inexhaustible faith in divine assistance and cooperation. I pray to Allah the Exalted to increase His blessings on this nation.
By the blessedness of this holy day, this auspicious Eid and the soul of the Last Prophet (s.w.a.), I hope God will bestow His blessings and assistance on the Iranian nation and other Muslim nations.
I hope He will make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with us.
Leader's Message Condemning Insult to the Holy Quran - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Surely We have revealed the Reminder, and surely We are its Guardian. [The Holy Quran, 15:9]
Dear Iranian nation, Great Islamic Ummah,
The insane, hateful, and disgusting insult to the Holy Quran in the United States which took place under police protection is a bitter and important event which cannot be considered as only an insane move by a number of worthless mercenaries.
This is a calculated move by centers which have pursued the policy of Islamophobia and anti-Islamism for many years. And they have fought against Islam and the Holy Quran by using hundreds of methods and thousands of propaganda and operational tools.
This is another link in the disgraceful chain that was formed by the treachery of the apostate Salman Rushdie and was continued by the hundreds of anti-Islam Hollywood movies and the move by the wicked Danish caricaturist. These moves have now led to this hateful theatre. Who and what is behind these evil moves?
Analyzing this evil process - which was accompanied during the recent years by criminal operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, and Pakistan - leaves no doubt about the fact that the process is planned and controlled by the heads of the domineering powers and Zionist think tanks which wield the greatest influence on the US government, its military and security organizations, the British government and some European governments.
The purpose of the recent disgusting action is on the one hand to extend opposition against Islam and Muslims to all levels of Christian communities, to put a religious façade on such opposition, and to gain support from religious biases and concerns through the use of churches and priests. On the other hand, they intend to divert the attention of Muslim nations from the issues and developments of the Muslim world and the Middle East by causing them to be enraged and offended by this great offence.
This spiteful action is not simply the beginning of a movement. Rather, it is one of the stages of the long process of anti-Islamism that is led by the Zionist regime and the US.
All the heads of the arrogant powers and Aimmatul Kufr [leaders of Kufr] have now stood against Islam. Islam is the religion of human freedom and morality and the Holy Quran is the book of mercy, wisdom, and justice. It is the duty of all freedom seekers of the world and followers of Abrahamic religions to stand by Muslims and oppose the evil policy of Islamophobia which is being carried out through such disgusting methods.
The heads of the US government will not be acquitted of complicity in this hideous event through their use of hollow and deceiving remarks.
All the rights and honor of millions of innocent Muslims in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Pakistan as well as what they hold sacred have been trampled underfoot for many years.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, tens of thousands of men and women have been enslaved and tortured, thousands of children and women have been abducted, and millions of people have been paralyzed and disabled.
Why do western media introduce Muslims as the symbol of violence and Islam and the Holy Quran as a danger for humanity despite all such innocence?
Who can believe that this vast plot is probable and practical without the assistance of the Zionist circles operating within the US government?
Muslim brothers and sisters from Iran and all parts of the world,
I deem it necessary to mention a few points to everyone.
First, this event and the preceding events clearly show that what is being targeted by the global arrogant powers is the essence of Islam and the Holy Quran.
The blatant opposition of the arrogant powers against the Islamic Republic is a result of the clear opposition of the Islamic Republic against the global arrogance.
And pretending not to be hostile towards Islam and other Muslims is a great lie and evil deception.
They are opposed to Islam and everyone who is committed to it.
Second, this chain of spiteful actions against Islam and Muslims is the result of the fact that the light of Islam has been brighter than ever before during the past few decades and that the influence of Islam on the hearts has been increased more than ever before both in the Muslim world and even in the west.
These actions are the result of the fact that the Muslim world is more aware than ever before and that Muslims are determined to break the chain of two centuries of domination and invasion by the arrogant powers.
The insult to the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) is an event which represents a great promise despite its bitter nature.
The brilliant rays of the Holy Quran will become brighter on a daily basis.
Third, we should all know that the recent event has nothing to do with churches and Christianity. And the puppet-like moves of some insane priests and mercenaries should not be written down in the record of Christians and their religious men.
Muslims will never do similar actions with regard to what is held sacred in other religions.
Fourth, it is now the US government and its policymakers that all Muslims hold responsible. If they are honest in claiming that they are not involved in the events, they should properly penalize the main elements behind this great crime and the perpetrators of this crime who caused pain in the hearts of one and half billion Muslims.
Greetings be upon Allah's pious servants
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Shahrivar 22, 1389
Leader’s New Year Address - Khamenei.ir
I would like to congratulate my dear countrymen across the country, all Iranians living in different parts of the world and all nations that value Norouz [Iranian New Year] on the auspicious occasion of Norouz and the beginning of spring and the new year.
I would like to congratulate my dear countrymen across the country, all Iranians living in different parts of the world and all nations that value Norouz [Iranian New Year] on the auspicious occasion of Norouz and the beginning of spring and the new year.
In particular I would like to extend my congratulations to the individuals and families who are rendering services to the country, the Revolution and the Islamic system, the families of our dear martyrs, our disabled war veterans and their families and the families of those who have sensitive and important duties and cannot be with their families during these holidays.
I hope, by Allah's grace and favor, the people of Iran will have a happy year full of divine blessings. I hope the Iranian people will be successful in all arenas.
Of course the bitter tragedies that are being imposed on the people of certain countries - such as Bahrain, Yemen and Libya - prevent us from fully enjoying the New Year celebrations.
I hope Allah the Exalted will soon bestow deliverance on the people of these countries - the people of Bahrain, the people of Yemen and the people of Libya. I hope Allah the Exalted will punish the enemies of these nations.
Eid shows the natural progression of man through the year, month, day and night.
And because this progression should be towards perfection and transcendence, each Eid enables man to enter a new stage in life.
By Allah's grace and favor, we Iranian people managed to make great accomplishments in the year 1389.
I named the year 1389 as "The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor".
Fortunately this slogan was practiced throughout the year. I can claim that over the past years "Intensified Effort and Labor" was the most successful slogan in terms of attracting the attention of the people and government officials, and it closely corresponded to the situation of the country.
Fortunately the people and the government truly showed intensified effort and labor throughout the year.
In general I feel that thankfully our nation is moving well on the path of progress and transcendence.
Of course this movement, which has gained further momentum on a daily basis, is the result of many years of efforts by our people and government officials. But this movement has gained further momentum with the passage of time.
For example, in the arena of production of knowledge, according to the figures presented by global and international centers, the contribution of our country to global scientific progress and production of knowledge is more than 11 percent. This is while our people make up only one percent of the population of the world.
Therefore, our country has thankfully made good progress in different areas.
Among the national issues - which should be the focus of our determined efforts in the year 1390 - economic matters are one of the most essential tools which are used by the enemies of our people to counter our nation.
Of course they are active in cultural, political and scientific arenas as well, but they are much more active in the arena of economic matters.
The sanctions which were imposed on us by the enemies of our nation were an attempt to thwart the accelerated progress of our country.
Of course their wishes were not fulfilled, and they did not manage to get the results they wanted. The measures adopted by our government officials and the cooperation of the people foiled the enemies' plot. But they will not give up.
Therefore, in the new year, which starts from now, we must pay attention to the most essential issues of the country, and I believe economic matters are the pivot of these issues.
Thus, I hereby name this year as "The Year of Economic Jihad", and I expect our officials - who work for the executive branch, the legislative branch and economic sectors of the country - and our dear people to make selfless efforts in the economic arena.
It is not enough to move forward at an ordinary pace.
As you know, we are entering the third year of the decade of justice and progress.
Of course good achievements have been made both in the arena of progress and to a large extent in the arena of justice, but our movement must be such that we can call this decade the genuine manifestation of progress and establishment of justice.
Fortunately with the movement that has started in the world of Islam, one feels that by Allah's favor this decade will be the decade of progress and justice for the region as well.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow His blessings on you dear people of Iran, on you dear government officials and on you faithful, spirited, active and talented youth. I hope God will help you benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
I commemorate our dear martyrs and our magnanimous Imam (r.a.), and I hope that by the blessedness of their souls, Allah the Exalted will bestow His mercy, grace and blessings on the Iranian nation.
Leader Meets Navy Officers - Khamenei.ir
He added: "During their long domination over Iran, satanic governments prevented the presence of Iran's Navy in regional and international waters, but today you should make up for the past backwardness by making intensified efforts."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the history of the presence of the bullying powers in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and said: "Today the conditions are different from the past. And the long coast of this region is being controlled by an independent government and a proud and vigilant nation that knows its national power and determination, a nation that will impose its will on any political and military power and will force it to retreat by relying on God."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "Thanks to the powerful presence of Islamic Iran, today the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman are free and independent."
Ayatollah Khamenei described the presence of US and European fleets in the region as detrimental and unpleasant and stressed: "The era in which the arrogant powers used to determine the destiny of other nations through their military presence has come to an end. Even if certain regional governments still have a tendency to follow the orders of the arrogant powers, nations of the region are vigilant and they consider foreigners' military presence in the region as a source of insecurity."
The Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces stressed: "We have not encouraged any country to cause confrontation and war and we will not do so.
We will avoid any accidental or calculated confrontation as much as we can, but those who rely on bulling to bring about progress for themselves should feel that they are faced with a powerful nation." His Eminence said that the Navy is the manifestation of the Iranian nation's power at sea.
He urged the Iranian Armed Forces to continue making efforts in a sincere and determined way and added that the Islamic Republic of Iran is indebted to the youth who show the power of the Iranian nation.
Leader’s Speech to Army Cadets - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei on November 10, 2010 at the graduation ceremony held at Shahid Sattari University.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to extend my congratulations to the dear graduates and the faithful youth who have finished their dignified studies and will start their services as members of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Armed Forces and the honorable Army of the Islamic Republic.
I would also like to extend my congratulations to the dear youth who received epaulets, and I hope they will continue their education successfully.
When looking at the issue objectively, our Armed Forces and the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army are at a very favorable level.
You are superior to other armies in terms of two things. First, your goal is a divine and human goal.
Second, there is a strong heartfelt bond between you and the people.
In order to provide security, tread the path of glory and achieve material and spiritual well-being, all societies and countries throughout the world are in need of power, and one important part of this power is provided by the armed forces in all societies and countries.
The main difference lies in the fact that the paradigm of power in material systems - which is prevalent in today's world - is different from the paradigm of power in the Islamic system.
This does not mean that we should ignore weapons. This does not mean that we should view discipline, weapons and training as insignificant. All these things are necessary, but the spirit of these things is the divine sense of responsibility, the feeling of reliance on Allah the Exalted.
This is the factor which makes an army and a nation so strong that material powers become unable to bring them to their knees, and ultimate divine assistance and ultimate victory belong to that nation and army.
This is not just at the level of theory. This is not just an expression of our ambitious dreams.
You dear youth can study these realties carefully in the recent history of the country.
The victory of the Iranian nation in the face of the taghuti system is a perfect example of the triumph of spiritual factors over material factors.
In this beloved and oppressed homeland, the taghuti, dependent and corrupt regime depended on different means of material power provided by international powers, but it was defeated by an unarmed nation that was equipped with faith and self-confidence.
The second experience is the one that the Iranian nation went through during the Sacred Defense Era.
They were doing all of these things in order to defeat the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation. But amid comprehensive sanctions, especially sanctions on weapons and military equipment, the Iranian nation managed to defeat the enemy that had a mountain of weapons and military equipment at its disposal by relying on its faith, the faith of its youth and the valor of its Armed Forces.
The same is still true today.
Just see how much modern weaponry is exported to this region, how much money the countries of the region are spending on this weaponry and how much this profits the owners of military industries of America and the west.
Of course the Air Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army and its honorable martyrs - such as Shahid Sattari, Shahid Babai, Shahid Khazrai, Shahid Doran and many others - were pioneers on this path.
The first institute for self-sufficiency jihad of the Armed Forces was established in the Air Force. Both flight crew and technical support crew created values in one way or another.
The Islamic Republic will never forget these services.
Universities helped, and scientists of the country cooperated. Today besides relying on its faith and spiritual values, the Iranian nation is relying on the material means that it has built on its own.
We want them to feel that they can be independent of the arrogant powers of the world and that they can build Armed Forces that are equipped with the products of indigenous ideas and innovations. Look at everything from this perspective.
Continue your research with this orientation. Rely on yourselves. This is the experience gained by you, your country and veteran members of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army and the entire Armed Forces.
When you rely on yourselves, your talents flow like an inexhaustible spring and offer their outcomes to you, your organization and your nation.
The report that was presented by the commander of this university was a good report.
What he reported has been done in different areas, and this is good. But you should not be complacent about these things.
The path of perfection is an endless path. The more you move ahead, the more you will experience the pleasure of perfection.
This is true of material issues as well as spiritual virtues - such as closeness to God, attention to God, love for God and spirituality, and treading the divine path. The more you move ahead, the more powerful and delighted you will feel. This path is the path of you dear youth.
Allah the Exalted has promised that He will assist you if you promote His religion, tread His path and seek divine goals.
God's assistance means the assistance of the forces of nature - all of them will help you. Even supernatural forces will come to your aid. You will be assisted, and you will move ahead - just as you have up until today.
You should know that today your country is very different from 10 years ago and that it has made a lot of progress. It has made more progress compared to 20 years ago. It has made even more progress compared to the early years of the Revolution - thirty years ago.
This progress is the result of the determined efforts of our nation, our people, our youth, their reliance on Allah the Exalted and their efforts on this holy path. Continue these efforts.
Universities affiliated to the Armed Forces are among the most promising social and scientific centers of this country.
This university was named after Shahid Sattari - the honorable, hardworking, active, innovative, faithful and mujahid martyr.
During the Sacred Defense Era, before he was appointed as an Air Force commander, Shahid Sattari made many valuable efforts without many people knowing. He also rendered a lot of services as a commander.
Similarly, the rest of our dear martyrs - from the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force and different other parts of the Armed Forces - rendered great services. You should appreciate this university.
The plans should always be up-to-date and forward-looking, and they should be clearly formulated.
The honorable teachers should make as many efforts as they can.
The dear students should try their hardest. The senior commanders should visit such universities and speak with these dear youth in person.
We become dynamic when we look at you dear youth, and you can benefit from the experience of the veterans.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, bestow Your grace and blessings on these dear youth.
Dear God, bestow Your support and assistance on our Armed Forces, the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army, the Police and the Basij.
Leader: Leader Intervenes Only When Important National Interests Ignored - Khamenei.ir Ayatollah Khamenei said that insistence of the Iranian nation on its righteous positions and its efforts to become a role model for the regional nations is the main reason behind the pressures and the hostile propaganda broadcast against the Islamic Republic.
And this firm position of the Islamic Republic has made their sword blunt."
The Leader referred to the recent events in the Ministry of Intelligence and added: "Take a look at the propaganda broadcast by foreign media about these events - which are not very important. See what uproar they have caused. They are saying in their analyses that there is a rift in the ruling system of the Islamic Republic and that the President is not listening to the Leader."
Ayatollah Khamenei added: "The propaganda broadcast by the enemies over the past few days showed once again how they are looking for an excuse to ambush the Islamic Republic like a wolf."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the responsibilities have been clearly specified in the Constitution. He added that the Leader does not want to interfere in the decisions and actions of the administration, but that he will intervene whenever he feels an important national interest has been ignored. Ayatollah Khamenei stressed: "Regarding the recent event, which is not very important, I felt that an important interest has been ignored."
Ayatollah Khamenei added: "As long as I am alive and as long as I have this responsibility, I will not allow the slightest deviation in the great movement of the Iranian nation towards the ideals."
His Eminence stressed that as long as the people are present on the scene and enjoy wisdom, insight and strong determination, they will continue benefiting from God's blessings. "God's assistance will decrease if government officials go after their personal interests and forget the goals."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "Today the officials of the three branches of the government as well as the people are carrying out their heavy responsibilities in the arena of hard work and selfless efforts."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the name of the current Iranian year - "The Year of Economic Jihad" - and stressed: "All our people and government officials should join hands to start this movement because the purpose of choosing a name for each year is to start a movement towards the selected goal and slogan."
Elsewhere in his speech, the Leader of Islamic Revolution referred to the current regional developments and added: "Thanks to Islam and the Islamic Revolution, today Islamic Awakening has already taken place in the region, and this movement will definitely produce results, just as it has in certain parts of the region."
Ayatollah Khamenei added: "The more the determination, faith and preparedness of the people for self-sacrifice, the more the possibility of victory."
His Eminence said that America, Europe and the Zionists were surprised by the regional developments. "All efforts of the arrogant powers are focused on gaining control over the regional developments. But this Islamic Awakening will not stop, and this progressive movement is irrevocable."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "This movement will finally benefit the people of the region, but they must be fully vigilant because the enemy is looking for an opportunity to derail this movement."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the clear oppression against the people of Bahrain, Yemen and Libya and stressed: "Impartial analysis of the current regional developments, especially the events happening in these three countries, shows that western powers have oppressed the people and that they are the obvious criminal and culprit."
His Eminence said that the fake Zionist regime is the main reason why America and the west are oppressing the people of the region. He reiterated: "The people of Bahrain have been oppressed more than any other nation during the recent events."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the widespread propaganda of the west against Iran and added: "Because the Islamic Republic of Iran has adopted a righteous position and has announced it explicitly, western powers have focused their propaganda attacks on Iran."
Ayatollah Khamenei reiterated: "Despite what the arrogant powers want, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not an indifferent bystander, and the people, government and political figures of Iran will not stand by and watch the oppressive actions of the arrogant powers."
His Eminence rejected the allegations that Iran is interfering in the affairs of the regional countries and said that these allegations are baseless. He further added that the Islamic Republic of Iran has only explicitly announced its position on the events happening in Bahrain, Yemen and Libya.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated that the Islamic Republic of Iran has never been afraid of the disapproval of the superpowers when announcing its righteous and explicit positions.
Ayatollah Khamenei reiterated: "The protests of the Bahraini people are completely appropriate and righteous.
He added: "The Bahraini government is treating its people in the wrong way because such actions will produce no results other than increasing the anger of the people, and it may not be able to do anything if the people's anger erupts again."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated that the Bahraini government and the countries which have deployed their forces in Bahrain have made a mistake. Ayatollah Khamenei said that events in Libya are another example of the oppression of the arrogant powers against the people of other countries. "Westerners do not want a populist and Islamic government in Libya, a country which is close to Europe and is full of oil resources.
Therefore, they have decided to start a political game with the people of Libya, but the people of Libya have uncovered this western policy." His Eminence said that the international Zionist network is the main culprit in the recent events in the region. He reiterated: "By taking advantage of the current situation, they are trying to exert pressure on the people of Gaza and kill them on a daily basis.

Leader’s New Year Message - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I congratulate all my honorable countrymen who live across our dear and vast country, all Iranians who live in different parts of the world and have pinned their hopes on their beloved homeland, the self-sacrificing youth, men, and women who have made great sacrifices for the lofty goals of the Revolution and the country and who have laid down their lives and offered their youth to the Revolution and the glory of the country, the honorable families of our martyrs, our disabled war veterans and their self-sacrificing families, all those who made sacrifices during the war, and those who work and make efforts for the glory of the country on the auspicious occasion of Norouz and the beginning of the new year - which is the beginning of spring and revitalization of nature.
And I offer my greetings to the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam who was the founder of this great public movement and the source of progress and improvement of great Islamic Iran.
Norouz is the beginning of growth.
Just as this growth is tangible in nature, it can also be manifested in our hearts and souls and in our movement towards progress.
Let us have a look at the year 1388 which has ended now.
If the year 1388 were to be described in a sentence, I think the description would be, the year of the Iranian nation, the year of this great nation's glory and victory, the year of this nation's historic and significant presence in the arenas that determined the fate of our great Revolution and our country.
In the beginning of the year 1388, through their unprecedented presence the people gave rise to an election that was unprecedented in the history of our Revolution - and of course in the long history of our country -and was considered a prominent peak.
During the months following the election, the people demonstrated their presence, determination, resistance, national determination, and insight in a great test and in a great and fateful movement.
A short analysis of the post-election events which lasted several months is that after the passage of 30 years the enemies of the country and the enemies of the Islamic Republic have focused all their efforts and power on defeating this Revolution from within.
Faced with this great conspiracy and this hostile movement, the nation managed to bring the enemies to their knees through its unique awareness, insight, determination, and resistance.
The eight-month experience - from the presidential election to the 22nd of Bahman - that the nation and the country went through was full of lessons and was indeed a source of honor for the Iranian nation. In the year 1388, the nation had a brilliant performance.
Government officials made valuable and great efforts. These efforts are comparatively valuable.
All fair observers have a religious obligation to appreciate the efforts which were made in different arenas for the reconstruction, prosperity, and progress of the country.
In scientific arenas, in industrial arenas, in social activities, in foreign policy, and in many different areas, government officials have made great achievements.
Observing the current situation of the country and the great potentialities that lie in the heart of this great country and nation, one may conclude that what we have done and what government officials and the people have done are not a great achievement compared with the great potentials of this country for achieving progress and justice.
Everyone should make more efforts than before, and they should consider themselves responsible. This prayer, which we recite every New Year, contains a very interesting point. It says: "...transform our condition into the best condition."
It does not say transform us to a better state or better condition. It asks the Almighty to transform our condition to the best of conditions.
The sincere and dedicated effort of Muslim individuals is that which allows them to reach the best in all areas and affairs.
This year in order to attain that which this noble prayer teaches us and that which is our duty, in order to fulfill the needs and potentials of our nation, we need to multiply our efforts and increase our labor.
I name this year "The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor" with the hope that government officials together with the dear people of our country will make great strides in all affairs - in economic affairs, in cultural matters, in politics, in infrastructure and social matters.
We all are in need of this intensified effort.
We should know that there is a lot of work to be done in different areas.
Our enemies are the enemies of knowledge and faith in our society.
We should double our effort to strengthen our knowledge and faith.
By Allah's favor, our path will become smooth. The obstacles will become insignificant, and divine assistance will be with our people, our country, and our officials.
On the occasion of Eid al-Ghadir, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met with thousands of people from various social backgrounds.
Ayatollah Khamenei described Ghadir as a beacon that shows the path of the Islamic Ummah.
Referring to the disappointment of the infidels after Ghadir, he added: "Introducing the issue of Wilayat and appointing the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) as the successor of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was in fact a decision made by Allah the Exalted.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution cited Quranic verses and reliable Islamic narrations and said that Imam Ali (a.s.) is the exemplary figure of the history of Islam.
He touched on the propaganda and accusations that dismiss Shia Islam as a political fabrication and reiterated: "The issue of Ghadir, which is an indisputable reality in the history of Islam, refutes all these accusations and clarifies the roots and nature of Shia Islam."
Ayatollah Khamenei touched on the reasons behind the propaganda broadcast against Shia Muslims and said: "The arrogant powers of the world are well aware that the Iranian nation has helped all sympathetic Muslims and intellectuals of the world fulfill their wishes by relying on the spirit of Wilayat and establishment of an Islamic system.
Therefore, they are making efforts to portray Shia Muslims as a group that does not belong to the Muslim world."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the US and Britain as the greatest and most evil enemies of the Iranian nation and stated that the Zionist regime, the US, and other arrogant powers of the world are afraid of the vigilance of the Islamic Ummah.
By Allah's favor, these enemies have not managed to achieve their goals so far, and they will not do so in the future either."
Elsewhere in his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the false claims made by the Zionist regime and other foreign countries about the Islamic Republic's nuclear activities and added: "The enemies of the Iranian nation have reached a stage where they are trying to mislead global public opinion by spreading lies about the Islamic Republic's nuclear activities. But the truth will ultimately be revealed, and these lies will not benefit them and will disgrace them even further."
His Eminence advised the heads of the US, British, and other European governments to avoid spreading lies and added: "Regarding the nuclear issue, as I have repeatedly said, the Iranian nation is after gaining the knowledge which the country needs. And we believe that if the Iranian nation fails to acquire this knowledge today, it will not have enough time to do so in the future when the wheels of the world economy will be spinning around nuclear power."
He added: "Today the Iranian nation is making efforts to acquire knowledge in the field of nuclear energy so that the country's future generation will not be dependent on western countries in this regard.
But western countries are trying to prevent us from achieving this national goal by spreading lies and accusations as well as causing uproar."
His Eminence also urged the Iranian people to maintain their vigilance in the face of the arrogant powers of the world that are making use of all their political and propaganda tools to deny the Iranian nation its indisputable right.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution further touched on the current policies of the world's arrogant powers and said that these powers usually try to cause enmity and discord among nations when they cannot achieve their goals through threats, military attacks, or sanctions.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Iranian people are patient and steadfast, further adding: "In their propaganda, the leaders of the arrogant camp are saying that their patience is running out, but everybody knows that they have never been patient with Iran.
And they have used every opportunity to hatch all types of political, economic, military, and propaganda plots in order to defeat our nation."
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
By Allah's grace, the arrival of the New Year will be auspicious for you dear brothers and sisters.
The prayer "O Transformer of power and circumstances" transforms the year. This transformation is not just limited to transforming winter to spring. After all, all seasons of the year are transformed.
Winter is apparently tough, but it is in fact a preface to the beginning of spring.
These are all divine signs. We are used to these things, so we fail to appreciate their importance. Otherwise, if we were not used to these natural transformations, we would be surprised to found out how amazing they were.
Germination of plants, revitalization of nature and trees growing leaves - these are all signs of divine power, which we tend to ignore just because our eyes are used to them.
The same is true of our existence.
Different changes take place while we do not even notice them.
The longer he travels in that direction, the bigger the gap grows - the gap between the right direction and the direction in which he is walking.
When he finds out about the mistake, he suddenly realizes how big the gap has grown.
Daily prayers which must be said five times a day are indeed one of the greatest blessings of God.
If it were not for these daily prayers, we would be submerged in lack of vigilance.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to perform our daily prayers in an attentive and appropriate manner. If daily prayers are performed in an attentive manner, they will help us pay attention to our actions.
Therefore, if we are careless when the year 1388 ends and the year 1389 begins at a pre-specified point in time, we will not pay attention to the change in nature. And this point in time is identical to any other moment of our lives. From a natural and mathematical point of view, the last hour of the year 1388 is not at all different from the first hour of the year 1389.
In fact, we can add this to the capacities and features of Norouz.
Norouz, which is a seemingly non-religious Eid, is a national occasion for celebration. It does not have religious content, and it is not associated with religion. Although some narrations say "Norouz is among our days", I do not know how valid they are.
They pray, they engage in dhikr and they go to holy places. Even those who travel to another city - in which there are no famous holy places - spend the first hours of the New Year at the shrine of a descendant of an infallible Imam if they find one.
For example, if they travel to Shiraz, they spend the first hours of the New Year in Shahcheragh. This is a very good tradition that our people observe.
The more we can increase religious content of different events, the more we will benefit from them.
Man would be in a dire situation in the absence of religion.
This has always been the case in different eras.
In the modern world those who decided to manage the world in the absence of religion are now suffering from difficulties that are strangely severe.
These difficulties are not like physical problems that people suffer from in their daily lives, and they do not appear immediately. No, they appear only when it is too late for a solution.
When carnal desires are unleashed and when such policies and cultural norms are adopted, the situation becomes so grave that you see a government official, a minister, hold a formal wedding to celebrate his same-sex marriage without feeling ashamed of the people of the world. This will result in incest later on.
This is a problem in the modern world, but they are not prepared to accept it. However, they will undoubtedly reach the same conclusion. That is to say, this is the natural consequence of this trend.
This is the result that an irreligious world would produce.
People should and will turn back to religion. They have already started to do so. This will happen whether they want it or not.
And in this great movement, Islam is the brilliant point, the focus of attention among different faiths.
Islam is shining.
They want to stop Islam, but they cannot.
Their enmity towards the Islamic Republic is mainly due to this reason. They know that this is a religious movement. They know that it is religious faith that has encouraged the people to start this movement and remain on the scene.
Of course many of these politicians are not really involved in policy-making. They only enforce policies formulated by other people, and they only see the appearances. But those who develop international policies - those who really lead this world - have no choice but to understand that this is the case.
Of course they try to keep the world of Islam busy.
Today the events that are taking place in Palestine are due to the side issues that the world of Islam is busy with.
Today real tragedies are happening in Palestine, Gaza and the West Bank. The events that happened in Mecca should not be underestimated.
Purging Islamic works from their Islamic qualities is one of the dangerous things that is happening in front of Muslims' eyes in the world.
Everybody is so busy with side issues and trivial matters that they do not realize what is happening in the world of Islam.
This is a plot hatched by the enemies against the world of Islam.
Today the Organization of the Islamic Conference - which was basically established to defend the people of Palestine - has a responsibility to resist. It has a duty to mobilize the world of Islam against this cunning move by the Zionists and their supporters. In spite of their disagreements, the arrogant western powers generally cooperate in supporting the Zionists.
The world of Islam should stand up to resist, and it is able to do so. The world of Islam has great capacities to resist against the greed and evil plots of the Zionists. All attention is suddenly attracted to oil, but it is not a matter of oil.
Their reputation depends on this region. The most important passageways of the world are under the control of Muslim countries. These things are what the world depends on, and they are under the control of Muslims.
Being determined is itself a great means to influence the events that happen in the world.
Unfortunately this means is not utilized, and it is carelessly ignored.
In any case, we should learn lessons.
We should divide our issues into primary and secondary issues, and we should focus on the primary issues.
We should focus on guiding our people and helping our government make progress. I hope Allah the Exalted will awaken us so that we can identify and fulfill our responsibilities appropriately.
By Allah's favor, the New Year will be auspicious for all of you, and I hope you will benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Leader’s Speech to Assembly of Experts - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 10, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with members of the Assembly of Experts.
In Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Honorable gentlemen and esteemed members of the Assembly of Experts, welcome.
I would like to thank the dear brothers and the esteemed gentlemen for their efforts - both the efforts which have been made during this meeting and the efforts which have been made in different commissions. I will pray for you.
I hope Allah the Exalted will accept your efforts and reward them.
I would like to thank all the gentlemen, especially Mr. Hashemi Rafsanjani who acted against the expectation of the spiteful enemies in this meeting. They expected to see discord grow among the members of the Assembly of Experts. They expected the competition for rendering services to turn into the commonplace competition of the material world, a negative competition to occupy centers and positions of power.
Well, this was what Mr. Hashemi was expected to do, considering the wisdom and sense of responsibility that I have always noticed in him.
Gentlemen, you elected the right person [as head of the Assembly of Experts].
Mr. Mahdavi has been a prominent figure since the beginning of the Revolution up until today as far as the world of the clergy, the world of politics, the current issues of the country and the issues of our Islamic seminaries and universities are concerned.
Thanks to the sincerity and wisdom of the gentlemen which can be noticed in their words and actions, what happened will benefit Islam and Muslims, and this is what is expected from the gentlemen.
Considering the issues of the region, the current conditions of the country are extremely important and sensitive.
There are great aspects to what is happening.
What the enemies, the international opportunists and arrogant powers want and what they are planning is a different issue.
What happened enjoys two crucial characteristics, and these two characteristics have been the wishes of sincere Muslims and those who cherish lofty ideals in the Islamic Republic and other parts of the world.
These two characteristics are very important.
Presence of the people means stepping into the battlefield and facing the dangers, just like what happened in Iran.
When this happens, no power can stand up against a nation, let alone powers like America.
Even if all powers of the world join hands, they cannot stand up against a nation that has entered the arena with all its power.
Of course they wage wars, kill people and shed blood, but they are defeated in the end.
As the Imam (r.a.) said at that time, blood will overcome the sword.
This is one point which is very important.
It is Allah the Exalted who bestows determination on hearts and deploys them.
The divine hand of power is noticeable in such events and because the divine hand of power is involved in these events, victory is ensured.
The second point is the issue of Islamic slogans.
In Islamic countries, the people are part of the Islamic Ummah.
Islam has set its roots even in countries where the manifestation of Islam was limited and where the people have been pressured.
And this is a characteristic of Islam.
The same is true of regional countries.
Of course there have always been other motives as well: liberal, socialist, ethnic and other such motives.
Therefore, the event that is happening is an extraordinary event, and it is in its early stages. As government officials of the Islamic Republic, we have responsibilities to fulfill. We should pay attention to these responsibilities and not let this historical stage pass us by.
The Islamic Revolution created a role model and a discourse, and this is one of the things that definitely affected these events.
The Islamic Revolution became a model for Muslims.
The construction projects which have been carried out in the country have in some cases put the country among the top countries in the world.
These are the things which have already taken place.
They can see these things. The Revolution came and established a system of government, and this system prevailed and achieved increasing power and progress on a daily basis.
Today the sense of Islamic identity among Muslim countries is not comparable to 30 years ago. Today the sense of Islamic dignity and the demand for this Islamic dignity is not comparable to the past.
This has already happened.
Naturally, as a consequence, the opposing camp is defeated.
Corrupt and dependent autocrats were in power in some countries.
This is a modern example, and it is very valuable.
This is the direction of an important portion of the propaganda that is broadcast against the Islamic Republic: they want to prevent creation of role models. They want to prevent the Islamic Republic from becoming a successful role model in the eyes of Muslim nations.
I believe this is a very important point which deserves our attention.
The enemies are trying to prevent the Islamic Republic from presenting itself as a successful role model to other nations. This is because when a role model appears, people move towards it.
When the success of this role model is recognized, people are encouraged to follow it.
About fifty or sixty years ago, an Egyptian writer wrote in his book that if Muslims manage to establish an Islamic government in a part of the world, it is more effective in spreading Islam than thousands of books and efforts to promote Islam.
He was right. Unfortunately we are far away from practicing Islam in a perfect way. Although the model we have presented does not correspond to Islam as much as we want, our current level of success in infusing Islam into our society has revealed its positive effects.
We can see the resulting glory, power, progress and independence. The people can see these effects. Therefore, they want to prevent the presentation of role models.
As a result, they try to undermine this role model in the eyes of those who want to follow it.
This is one of the things that has been done since the beginning of the Revolution.
This is one of the essential things that the enemy follows in his propaganda, and all their efforts are in this direction.
One is the domestic factor: the shortcomings that we are suffering from.
The domestic factor harms this role model. The other factor is related to the enemy. They magnify our flaws a hundred times and make others notice them.
What should we do?
First of all, we should take care of the domestic factor.
If we take care of the domestic factor, Allah the Exalted will take care of the other factor.
We should first criticize ourselves, and then the enemy.
How should it be practiced? Primarily it is government officials, elites, prominent figures, intellectuals, scholars, ulama and influential people who should watch their behavior.
The atmosphere of insult and disrespect in society is one of the things that Islam is opposed to. We must not let this happen.
And everybody is responsible in this regard.
I would like to address this message to all those who make public statements or write in newspapers or weblogs.
All of them should know that they are not doing the right thing.
It is one thing to raise objections, present reasons or condemn a wrong political or religious idea, but it is quite another thing to do something that goes against ethical principles, sharia and political common sense. I reject the latter completely and decisively. It must not be done.
I would like to address this advice to our youth in particular. Some of our youth - who are undoubtedly sincere, faithful and good people - believe that what they are doing is a duty.
No, I would say what they are doing works against their duty.
Of course we should not ignore the enemy's attempts at infiltration, evil deception and interference. As the Imam (r.a.) used to say, sometimes the enemy infiltrates enthusiastic and faithful groups and attracts them towards a certain direction or move. It is necessary to be cautious in this regard and not fall into the trap of lack of vigilance resulting from becoming emotional and failing to see the hands of the enemy.
Therefore, I ask our youth in particular to put an end to this atmosphere of insult, backbiting, leveling accusations, cursing and disrespect.
If this atmosphere prevails, it will spread like a contagious disease.
And this is totally wrong.
My previous advice was addressed to the youth, but elderly people also need advice. They should be cautious as well.
Adopting appropriate positions, saying the right thing, refusing to be influenced by false news - these are a duty as well.
They spend day and night trying to do something that is in line with the Islamic movement.
All our people should be vigilant in this regard, young and old. We are always in need of advice, both when we are young and when we are old.
I hope Allah the Exalted will help all of us to preserve this successful and impressive role model - namely, the Islamic Republic. By Allah's favor, we will manage to pass on this role model to future generations, and we will be able to hold up our heads before Allah the Exalted.
Leader Meets People of Isfahan - Khamenei.ir
In a meeting with thousands of people of Isfahan, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to religious faith and commitment to divine values as the secret behind the achievements of the Iranian nation.
Thanks to the strength of this auspicious commitment, the Iranian nation will be pioneering and victorious in all arenas, and the enemy will continue being unsuccessful and hopeless. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution congratulated the faithful and selfless people of Iran and all Muslims throughout the world on Eid al-Adha.
He said that understanding the philosophy behind Eid al-Adha will help open up different paths in individual and national life, adding: "The great sacrifice by Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) and the great divine appreciation that righteous prophet received for his sacrifice are indicative of the fact that it is not possible to tread the path of transcendence and progress in the absence of self-sacrifice."
His Eminence stated that the philosophy behind continued divine tests is to help individuals and nations achieve a higher level of growth and transcendence. He reiterated that any individual and people who go through divine tests and hardships will get one step closer to their ultimate destination.
Regarding the philosophy behind divine tests, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the Iranian nation's success in dealing with the fitna of the year 1388 as an example. He reiterated that the Iranian nation's success was not just indicative of its power.
Rather, the most important meaning of the powerful weathering of last year's test and hardship was that the Iranian nation reached a new stage of its life by relying on its faith and insight, understanding the requirements of time and taking the necessary measures. And it gained new strength to achieve its ultimate goal.
Elsewhere in his statements, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the self-sacrifice of the people of Isfahan on the 25th of Aban in the year 1361 as another example of success in divine tests. "On that great day, the people of Isfahan sent thousands of their valorous youth to the battlefields while holding a funeral ceremony for 370 martyrs."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the presence of the faithful and revolutionary people of Isfahan in different events before and after the Revolution is a manifestation of the spirit of faith, self-sacrifice and jihad among the people of Isfahan province.
He reiterated: "Reflecting on these achievements will help us understand the identity and potential of the people of Isfahan, and it will show the people of Isfahan how to continue their progress, glory and pioneering role."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the enemy has pinned its hopes on causing a rift between the people, creating a gap between the people and government officials and causing suspicion and disagreement over trivial issues. "Everybody should carefully watch these activities of the enemy."
His Eminence criticized the individuals who accuse the Islamic Republic of what foreigners desire by creating pessimism, despair and discord across the country.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that promoting moral corruption and use of drugs is a means that is used by the enemies to further their political goals. He called on the people, government officials and the youth to be vigilant in this regard. Referring to Isfahan's Islamic seminary and prestigious universities, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution described Isfahan as a center of religious and scientific studies.
Leader: Progress Is Destiny of Iranian Nation - Khamenei.ir
In a meeting with thousands of laborers from across the country on the eve of International Labor Day, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said this morning that progress is the definite destiny of the Iranian nation.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that that labor and laborers are an irreplaceable link in the chain of fulfilling vital needs of the country.
He further added that during the early years of the Islamic Revolution leftist elements made many efforts to pitch the Iranian labor community against Islam and the Islamic Republic, but that laborers foiled their plots. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the presence of laborers in the Sacred Defense and in the arenas of hard work and progress were the signs of the deep commitment of the Iranian labor community to Islam, the Revolution and Iran.
His Eminence stated that the general policy of the Islamic Republic is to create solidarity among the elements that affect labor.
Elsewhere in his speech, His Eminence referred to "The Year of Economic Jihad" and added: "The enemies are continuing their efforts in cultural, security, political and other areas. Moreover, they have focused their attack against Islam and the Islamic Republic on economy in order to create a rift between the people and the government. Therefore, it is necessary to fight the enemy with all our power, relying on our sincerity, understanding and insight."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that combining Iranian art and capabilities will prepare the ground for improving the quality of domestic products and added: "Certain domestic products can rival similar foreign products, and certain other domestic products are far better than similar foreign products. It is necessary to achieve this quality in all domestic products."
Being dependent on foreign products and ignoring the efforts of Iranian laborers is a kind of disease and a bad habit which direct our national wealth into the pockets of foreign laborers. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that consuming domestic products is one of the necessities of "The Year of Economic Jihad" and added: "It is also necessary to raise the quality of these products to an acceptable level."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the anti-human organizations of the arrogant powers have been making constant efforts in order to harm the Islamic Republic. "By isolating Iran, they wanted to prevent our Islamic system - which is the representation of Islamic and human glory and honor - from becoming an inspirational role model for other nations, but in the impressive uprisings of the people of the region, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic have won more respect and attention than ever before.
His Eminence stressed: "Thanks to the fact that nations are moving on the path of Islam, the future of the region will be far better than its current situation."

Leader's Address to Teachers - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on May 5, 2010 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to a large group of teachers from across the country.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Dear brothers and sisters, welcome!
I would like to congratulate all of you and all the teachers across the country as well as the Iranian nation on Teachers' Day.
There is a lesson in the fact that Teachers' Day was chosen to coincide with the day a great teacher was martyred. That was a symbolic decision. That is to say, the greatness of teaching is so much that this praiseworthy and great job requires a combination of intellectual and scholarly work as well as presence in essential arenas of life - as was evident in Shahid Motahhari's life.
One essential point is that the teaching community of our country should always keep the greatness of their job in mind.
If you know what a great job you are doing, your motivation, efforts, and faith will be doubled - just like a courageous soldier who is doing his job and making selfless efforts in a sensitive part of the front, and the role of his selfless efforts is so great that it can affect and benefit the entire friendly front.
If the soldier is aware of this, he will never get tired or bored, and nothing will undermine the hope in his heart.
Teachers play a vital role in society, and their role is not comparable to other important roles in society. Our teachers should always keep this point in mind.
This has been scientifically proven. Just as the effect of genetic factors involved in some physical disorders can be offset through treatment and prevention, it is also possible to change inherited moral and spiritual factors.
Conversely, they can make them bad-natured and malevolent. They can train their students to be optimistic, self-confident, hopeful, and hardworking, or they can make them hopeless and isolated.
This shows the importance of teachers' role. Society needs faithful, motivated, patient, hopeful, optimistic, innovative, thoughtful, and scholarly individuals who are committed to pursuing public interests and reaching the peaks of individual and social perfection.
That is where the role of teachers becomes clear.
Of course many different things have been said about educational issues and the role of teachers.
Today we do not have the luxury of limiting ourselves to words only. We need action.
The education system can determine the future of this country.
I know that it is difficult to achieve these goals, but teachers cannot just put their motivation and sense of responsibility on hold until a favorable situation is created in the education system.
I advise all dear teachers across the country to develop faith in the greatness of their role. You should know that you are playing a key role in the future of this country.
For several centuries, our country has suffered great losses and backwardness. Lack of care has caused irreparable damage. And today this situation is what we are left with.
The dear teachers should know what kind of people we need for the future of this country and what characteristics our men and women should have in order to reconstruct this country appropriately.
This is all in your hands.
You have control over the children and adolescents who sit in your classrooms.
A wise teacher can do all of this within the confines of the classroom.
This need will bring about a response. When this need for guidance is felt by teachers, other parts of the country will be informed immediately, and they will try to address it.
Our needs will not be fulfilled unless we first feel and express them.
That is the role the education system should play.
He did not refuse to enter any arena where an Islamic intellectual was needed.
He was not thwarted by any considerations or interests - both on political fronts and in intellectual matters. When answering different questions that preoccupied me and other youth at that time, Shahid Motahhari was not like certain so-called religious intellectuals who used to present non-religious concepts as religion.
He was not after attracting praise from a particular group or intellectual association.
This was the characteristic of that great man.
He was not after fame or a position in the university or Islamic seminary.
He stepped in as an intellectual soldier.
He worked sincerely, and Allah the Exalted blessed his work.
Today his ideas are still alive and novel even after the passage of 30 years since his martyrdom.
At that time, his thoughts and ideas provided answers for different people at various intellectual levels. Today many intellectual advances have been made and many intellectual problems have been resolved, but Shahid Motahhari's thoughts and ideas still provide answers to new questions.
This is the characteristic of a profound thought that is accompanied by sincerity. Sincerity works miracles.
When someone sets out on a path for the sake of God, He blesses their efforts. That is why a few decades of work by that esteemed martyr continues to be an inexhaustible resource for our society.
Three decades have passed since the second greatest event in our country - that is to say, the establishment of the Islamic Republic which was the second most important event after the introduction of Islam. The Revolution awakened the world of Islam. It affected the political equations not just in the region, but in the entire world.
The world of Islam is divided. In spite of the fact that Muslims have access to the Holy Quran and firm religious teachings, they are suffering from backwardness due to various reasons.
What are these reasons?
We need to identify them. The Iranian nation should try to achieve a position that all its actions, moves, and intellectual output are referred to by the world of Islam and its intellectuals as authoritative.
And this is the path that lies ahead of us, and we should tread this path appropriately. We should move forward with self-confidence. We should make use of all our power, our human and intellectual capacities, and the talents that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on the Iranian nation.
If this happens, the fate of the world of Islam will be changed, which will lead to changing the fate of the world. The modern world is moving in an inappropriate direction. It is in a bad situation.
Moral values have been trampled upon. People of the world are suffering from the consequences of this moral degeneration, and intellectuals living in different countries are aware of this great tragedy.
They are troubled, and they express their concerns. We can tread a path that will be a source of salvation for humanity.
The first step is to transform ourselves, which starts with education.
Thankfully, the appropriate infrastructures have been created on different fronts during the past 30 years.
We can move ahead relying on these infrastructures.
Each achievement that the Iranian nation makes will disappoint certain people in the world.
Superpowers will naturally deploy their forces against the movements that are not in line with their interests. These things are not surprising and should be expected by any nation that enters great arenas of life.
Since the beginning of the Revolution, our nation has continued its path in the face of all these obstacles. Such problems are nothing.
The experience of the Iranian nation has shown that their threats, statements, and opposition cannot at all slow down the speed of our nation's progress.
Our nation will continue its path.
I hope the officials in charge of the Ministry of Education will pay attention to these important realities and heavy responsibilities and will pursue this great goal through intensified work and serious efforts.
And I hope you dear teachers will further this goal optimistically by relying on Allah the Exalted and expecting divine reward, grace, and guidance.
I hope God will reward you all and make the holy souls of our dear martyrs happy with us, the esteemed martyrs who prepared the ground for our nation to deal with these important matters.
May Allah the Exalted associate the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) - who opened up this path for our nation - with the holy souls of His saints. I hope all of you will benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Leader Meets with Basijis - Khamenei.ir
His Eminence said that the essence of Eid al-Ghadir belongs to all Muslims and all those who care about the welfare of humanity.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the Shia faith in the appointment of Imam Ali (a.s.) as the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) successor is based on strong and indisputable reasons.
Explaining the meaning of Imamate, Ayatollah Khamenei said: "Imamate means that a person or a group takes on the leadership of a society and specifies the direction of its movement in worldly and religious matters.
Therefore, in this sense Imamate has been the main issue of all human communities throughout history."
His Eminence cited verses from the Holy Quran and said that Imamate can be divided into two different categories. "In one kind of Imamate, a perfect example of which is the leadership of the divine prophets, just leaders lead the people towards the ultimate goal of human life. In the other kind of Imamate, which is exemplified by the leadership of the Pharaoh, the people are lead towards corruption, fire and destruction."
Explaining the comprehensiveness of the meaning of Imamate, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "Even in the most secular governments of the world, in spite of all the claims that political centers are separate from religious and spiritual centers, the life of the people both in this world and in the hereafter is in the hands of the rulers, and the positions adopted by the rulers shape the life of the people of those societies in this world and in the hereafter."
His Eminence said that big cultural organizations of the west and global bullies are among the leaders that act like the Pharaoh and lead the people towards corruption and destruction.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) establishment of an Islamic community as a proof of the fact that Islam is not limited to verbal admonishment and that it is after implementing divine rules in society. His Eminence said that appointing a successor for the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) in Ghadir Khumm was an effort to continue this path.
He added: "Although the history of Islam went off in a different direction, this standard and this auspicious thought remained in history until it was finally fulfilled in another part of the world thanks to the faith and resistance of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Iranian nation. And by Allah's grace, it will be promoted in the entire world of Islam on a daily basis."
His Eminence referred to the Basij as a prominent and brilliant truth and added that the presence of all Iranians from diverse ethnic and occupational backgrounds in the Basij is a sign that shows the inclusiveness of this impressive and unique organization.
His Eminence described as futile the efforts made by the enemies of the Iranian nation and their followers inside the country to humiliate and insult the Basij.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the Basij as a disciplined and systematic organization and reiterated: "There is no organization in the world that can match the Basij in terms of quantity, but the important point is that the Basij relies on beliefs, faith and emotions.
And this reality can help resolve the problems of the country and the nation during hard times."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to sincerity and insight as the essential foundations of the Basij and added: "These two determining factors contribute to one another.
That is to say, the more one's insight increases, the more one's sincerity will be.
And the more sincere a person is, the more God will increase the light of insight in him." The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that passions are the most important obstacles to insight. He referred to the behavior of certain people in the fitna of the year 1388 and added: "During those events, certain elements of the fitna ignored the interests of the country in order to achieve power.
But some people did not and do not see these clear truths.
Of course in spite of the fact that some people understand these truths, they are not prepared to act on the basis of this understanding due to their passions and the darkness of their heart."
He added: "A large portion of the world's population has realized the essence of the auspicious Revolution of the Iranian nation, but global powers have deployed their forces against the awakening yell of the Iranian nation."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the fulfillment of the divine promise of victory is the ultimate result of the Iranian nation's confrontation with the camp of global tyranny and arrogance.
He reiterated: "Until that bright future is achieved, the enemies will continue creating problems for our nation.
Therefore, it is necessary to preserve and strengthen our preparedness."
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this morning with thousands of enthusiastic students.
During this meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei described the 13th of Aban as a very important and meaningful symbol which represents numerous realities. His Eminence stated: "One of the events which happened on the 13th of Aban was Imam Khomeini's speech in the year 1343 which took place in the city of Qom. The speech was delivered in protest at the legislation - passed in the Majlis of that time - regarding the legal immunity of American citizens in Iran.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that this event is indicative of the greed of the US and the oppressive attitude of the arrogant powers towards other nations, including the Iranian nation.
If nations do not resist the US, it will go as far as it can to trample the honor of other nations underfoot."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution further touched on the seemingly friendly discourse of American presidents during different eras and said: "Although their discourse is seemingly soft, it is in fact similar to the iron fist which is covered with a velvet glove."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that faith should be accompanied by insight and added that this is one of the realities of the 13th of Aban.
He also referred to the actions of the mercenaries of the Pahlavi regime and the killing of students on the 13th of Aban in the year 1357, further adding: "Based on this fact, the 13th of Aban is the symbol of the pioneering role of the youth and their presence on the scene."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the pioneering role of students during the Sacred Defense Era and said that this pioneering role is rooted in their commitment, revolutionary spirit and insight.
Ayatollah Khamenei further mentioned the capture of the American embassy on the 13th of Aban in the year 1358 and added: "This action was indicative of the courage and bravery of the revolutionary youth in the face of the impressive power of the US.
This is because capturing the US embassy undermined the power of the US which was very great at that time and brought the US to its knees."
Ayatollah Khamenei urged the youth to increase their insight and reflect upon realities, adding: "By Allah's favor, the youth of our country have an enthusiastic, influential and insightful presence in political, economic, scientific and technological arenas today."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the failure of the fitna of the year 1388 was a clear example of the vigilant and influential presence of the youth and reiterated: "The fitna which happened last year was a great finta. The dangerous plot which was hidden behind this fitna will be uncovered after many years. The fitna failed due to the pioneering presence of the youth on the scene."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the ringleaders of the fitna of the year 1388 sought to capture Iran through their complex plots and added: "Throughout the process, the elements of the fitna, the majority of whom had entered this event unknowingly, moved in the direction which helped promote the goals of the ringleaders of this fitna.
This is an issue which requires accurate psychological analysis in order to figure out how some individuals unknowingly helped the enemies."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the prominent scientific, technological and political achievements made in the country, the reconstruction projects which are being carried out in the country, and the accelerated movement of the Iranian nation towards the peaks of progress and said that the Iranian nation has become independent in many arenas by relying on its rich and talented human resources and its efficient and sympathetic managers.
Leader’s Address to Instructors and Reciters of Holy Quran - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 2, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Republic in a meeting with a group of reciters and instructors of the Holy Quran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to thank the dear brothers who recited verses from the Holy Quran in a beautiful voice and enlightened our hearts with the light of the divine Book.
I hope Allah the Exalted will increase the familiarity of our people, especially our youth, with the Holy Quran as much as possible.
All the shortcomings in the world of Islam are the result of having strayed away from divine and Quranic teachings.
The Holy Quran is the Book of wisdom, knowledge and life.
The life of nations depends on familiarity with Quranic teachings, acting according to the requirements of these teachings and practicing Quranic ahkaam [Islamic rules extracted from religious texts through Islamic jurisprudence].
If human beings like justice and if they hate oppression, they should learn the ways of fighting oppression from the Holy Quran.
If human beings are determined to acquire knowledge and if they want to use their knowledge to improve their life and bring about comfort and welfare for themselves, they can learn how to do so from the Holy Quran.
If human beings are after spiritual purity, closeness to Allah the Exalted and establishing a relationship with Him, the Holy Quran is the solution.
The weakness of the Islamic Ummah, our backwardness, our wrong behaviors, our moral deviations - all of these things are the result of having strayed away from the Holy Quran.
Muslim nations turned their back on their own culture and they accepted the materialistic culture.
On the face of it, we were shouting "there is no god but God" and we remained Muslims, but western culture and western teachings affected our hearts and made us stray away from the truths.
Then we lost not only our economic privilege and material dignity, but also our morality and ethical principles.
If we are suffering from laziness and weakness, if our hearts are not close to each other, if there is malevolence among us - these are the results of the non-Islamic and anti-Islamic culture that has been imposed on us.
The role of the Holy Quran is to improve us materially and spiritually and the Holy Quran does this.
One of the examples is the Iranian nation.
It is wrong to think that the Iranian nation had the slightest credibility on international fronts during the time of satanic regimes - both during the time of the Pahlavi regime and during the time of the Qajar regime.
The enormous talent that our nation enjoys had been buried like a forgotten treasure. Proving one's talent was a matter of chance and it did not really happen.
There are so many active, dynamic and innovative youth who are interested in the progress of the country and bring about honor and fame for our country in different areas. There were similar youth in the country at that time as well, but they could not do anything due to the hegemony of satanic governments.
We took a step towards the Holy Quran and Quranic teachings - and what we have done is not more than a step - and Allah the Exalted bestowed dignity on us. He bestowed awareness and insight on us. He bestowed power on us.
Today our nation is one of the most responsive and most powerful nations in the world.
There is potential and enormous talent in different areas and we see numerous advances on different fronts: this is the situation of our country today.
Moreover, other nations praise our nation. Fortunately Islamic slogans that would provoke Muslim nations into action have been witnessed in different countries, just as you see and hear today.
This is the case in places where there is more activity and dynamism, where there is more efficiency and influence, where there is little susceptibility to the enemies and hypocrites and where there are Islamic slogans, Islamic demands and Islamic determination. This is the characteristic of Quranic teachings.
It is necessary to become familiar with the Holy Quran.
Of course today is not comparable with the past.
I remember that a prominent Egyptian qari - the late Abul Ayneyn Shaisha - had travelled to Mashhad and was reciting the Holy Quran in Goharshad Mosque. His recitation was very good.
The meeting had been arranged by the organization in charge of religious endowments. Unlike today's endowments organization, which is thankfully an honorable organization, the organization in charge of endowments was a notorious organization at that time. Although I was very eager to listen to the recitation by that qari, I was reluctant to go to that meeting.
I listened to his recitation from a distance.
There were not more than 50-60 people in that meeting.
Some of them were government agents and some others were famous qura from the city of Mashhad.
Today it is necessary to increase the interest in the Holy Quran, the interest which is prevalent everywhere. It is necessary to increase this interest on a daily basis.
Memorizing the Holy Quran is one of the things that can teach us to reflect on the Holy Quran.
We have a shortage of memorizers.
Previously I said that we should have at least one million memorizers of the Holy Quran in the country. Compared to our population, one million is not a big number. Now that our friends have made preparations and plans in order to promote memorization of the Holy Quran, I have become more hopeful and I would say we should have ten million memorizers in the country, not just one million.
Of course you should note that memorizing the Holy Quran is the first step.
First of all, it is necessary to remember what one has memorized.
As a memorizer, when you have to recite the Holy Quran repeatedly, you will have the opportunity to reflect on Quranic verses.
Of course it is necessary to become familiar with the interpretation of Quranic verses as well. When a person has memorized the Holy Quran, when he is familiar with the interpretation of Quranic verses and when he reflects on the verses, what will happen will be the same thing that our society expects: Quranic blossoming.
Fortunately the ground is prepared for this to happen. Today our nation enjoys steely determination.
But building such a Quranic society will only be possible in those conditions and I hope the conditions will be created.
As the people who are familiar with the Holy Quran, who recite the Holy Quran and who are interested in listening to recitations by qura with pleasant voices, you dear youth should appreciate your value. By Allah's favor, you will be rewarded by God.
You are in fact at the vanguard of this general movement in society.
You may be faced with more hardships, but you will be rewarded more by Allah the Exalted.
Dear God, make us be accompanied by the Holy Quran throughout our life.
Dear God, do not separate us from the Holy Quran neither in this world nor in the next.
Dear God, put us in the shade of the Holy Quran in the hereafter.
Dear God, bestow a Quranic, divine and Islamic life on us.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.
Do not separate us from the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.

Sayyid Ali Khamenei
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Today is the seventh day of the martyrdom of a group of our faithful and sincere fellow countrymen in Zahedan by bloodthirsty murderers and terrorists.
In this bloody event, the evil and criminal hand of prejudiced and misguided Wahhabis - who were supported by foreign espionage organizations - left families and hearts bereaved, hearts that had been enlightened by the light of love and respect for the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and purified by the light of pure knowledge and monotheism.
Blind, ignorant and criminal bigots put their misguided heart and dark nature at the service of the corrupt powers who have proven their enmity towards Islam and Muslims on numerous occasions, and they have shown their enmity and spite towards Muslims and have struck blows whenever and wherever they could.
Their enmity towards the Islamic Republic is because of the flag of Islam that has been raised in this country and the Islamic Republic's constant call to unity and Islamic power and glory.
In this bloody event and similar events, one of the goals of the enemies is to foment discord among Muslims.
The Islamic Republic that has been the biggest and the most reliable supporter of oppressed Muslims in Gaza, Palestine, Afghanistan, Kashmir and other Muslim areas is now the target of this evil plot hatched by the espionage organizations of America, the Zionist regime and England which wrongly believe they will involve Iran in religious fitna and Shia-Sunni confrontation.
They are unaware of the fact that Sunni Muslims in Islamic Iran have frequently proven their loyalty to this sacred Islamic system just like their Shia brothers, and they have bravely and faithfully stood up against the arrogant powers and their mercenaries to defend the Islamic Republic and their dear homeland.
Basically, the emergence and spread of brutal and blind terrorism in our region is the result of the evil policies of the US, Britain and their governmental and non-governmental mercenaries. All Muslims must oppose and fight against this sinister phenomenon which is a clear manifestation of corruption on earth and war against God.
All Sunni denominations of Iran as well as those of the neighboring countries - particularly Sunni religious scholars, intellectuals and academics - whose Islamic reputation has been targeted by these evil policies shoulder a heavier responsibility in this regard.
Shia and Sunni scholars of Islamic and Arab countries should clarify for everyone the evil intentions which the enemies pursue through establishing and supporting sectarian terrorism.
And they should warn them against the great danger of creating religious fitnas, which is what the enemies desire.
By Allah's permission, the Islamic Republic will not allow the elements of the global arrogance to create discord among Muslim brothers under such names as Wahhabism.
The organizations in charge in all the three government branches must seriously oppose these enemies of security and unity of the country and penalize those who are behind these fitnas.
And they should help the officials of the country fulfill their duties.
I send my regards to the souls of the dear martyrs of the bloody event in Zahedan, who were martyred on the birth anniversary of Imam Hussein (a.s.).
I also extend my sympathy to the dear and honorable families of these martyrs and pray to God to bestow patience, forbearance and rewards on the families of these martyrs.
Greetings be upon Allah's pious servants

Leader Attends Graduation Ceremony at Shahid Sattari University - Khamenei.ir
Speaking at the ceremony, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the Islamic Republic's model of power is based on faith, trust in God and sincere efforts to achieve lofty ideals.
He reiterated: "Relying on religious faith, the Armed Forces, including the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army, have managed to achieve notable advances in producing military equipment, and the Air Force has been a pioneer in this regard."
The Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces said that having a divine and human goal and a heartfelt bond with the people are two characteristics of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army.
He added: "In the Islamic Republic's model of power, discipline, military equipment and training have an important role, but the divine sense of responsibility and reliance on Allah the Exalted are the spirit of all these means."
Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that material powers whose model of power is based solely on military equipment and material calculations are not able to defeat a nation that has an Islamic model of power. "The victory of the Islamic Revolution was a clear example of superiority of spiritual power over material power. By relying on religious faith, the Iranian nation managed to defeat the Shah's satanic regime with empty hands."
His Eminence referred to the victory of the Iranian nation in the imposed war as another example of superiority of spiritual power over material power and added: "Amid comprehensive sanctions during the Sacred Defense Era, the Iranian nation managed to defeat the corrupt Ba'ath Party - which was receiving full support from the east and the west - by relying on the faith and courage of its youth and Armed Forces."
The Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces said that strengthening self-reliance and helping talents blossom are one of the characteristics of Islamic power.
He stressed: "According to the Islamic model of power, one can be independent of the arrogant powers of the world and build Armed Forces that are equipped with intellectual products of Iranian minds."
His Eminence stressed that the path of perfection and prosperity is endless and reiterated: "Military academies of the Armed Forces are among the most promising scientific centers of the country."
Leader's Message to Union of Islamic Students Associations in Europe - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the message by Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, to the participants of the 48th annual meeting of the Union of the Islamic Students Associations in Europe.
The message was read out on January 18, 2014 by Hojjatolislam wal-Muslemin Javad Ejeyi - the Leader's representative in charge of academic affairs in Europe - in Imam Ali Islamic Center in Vienna.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The youth and children of the Iranian nation who are acquiring knowledge in different universities throughout the world are valuable saplings which have their roots in fertile soil of their own country. Like their brothers and sisters in the dynamic and active universities of the country, they will provide their country and their people with valuable fruits.
This is the idea that Iranian students, anywhere in the world, should always bear in mind.
The quality of your learning, the field of study that you choose to study and the spirit which shapes your identity during your education should be based on this idea.
It is this idea which should determine your path.
In the exciting process of changing from a student into a manager and an outstanding personality in the future, reliance on God and asking for His kindness and mercy will help you more than everything else.
This is what cultivates your talents, solidifies your steps and comforts your hearts.
I entrust all of you to Allah the Great and I will pray for you.

Leader's Speech to Exemplary Laborers - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 28, 2010 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to a large group of laborers in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Laborers' Week does not just belong to our esteemed laborers - it belongs to all Iranians. This is because the working class is in fact one of the leaders of the public efforts to built the future of the country.
What Islam says about laborers - in the general sense of the word - is not simply a ceremonial gesture to make them feel happy.
The fact that the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.) bowed to kiss the hand of a laborer cannot be interpreted as a ceremonial gesture. That was an effort to create a cultural norm. That was a lesson which was intended to make the Islamic Ummah appreciate laborers and their efforts throughout history.
And that is how I think of the working class.
This is an important point.
That is the Islamic view of labor, and it is my heartfelt belief.
There is a great difference between this view of labor and materialistic views, including those of the capitalist and socialist camps where laborers are viewed as tools.
There is a great difference between this view of labor and the view that considers laborers as mujahids fighting on the path of God.
This is the genuine need in this regard. In the Islamic Republic the working class has emerged victorious out of different tests since the beginning of the Revolution.
During the Sacred Defense Era everybody was witness to the presence of laborers from agricultural, industrial, and service sectors of the country and from urban and rural areas. Everybody was witness to their presence on military and logistic fronts. Everybody saw that our laborers played a role during the 8 years of defense.
Apart from this, since the Revolution laborers have been among the most successful people in the Islamic Republic in different tests.
As you know, the working class and the slogans that are prepared for this social class throughout the world have always been used as a lever to pressure governments.
Since the beginning of the Revolution, some enemies tried to deploy the working class against the Islamic Republic.
On Bahman 20-22, 1357, I visited one of the factories on Karaj Highway several times because I had received some troubling news. I received the news from the laborers who were working for the factory.
I decided to go there.
That is to say, there were other people who were not working for the factory.
For several days I went to that factory early in the morning and came back late in the evening. One day I stood at a podium and spoke to them for nearly 7 hours! One of them came up and started reasoning and shouting slogans.
Eventually, the laborers themselves forced those disruptive elements to leave the factory. Ever since that day inventing political slogans and using laborers as political levers against the Islamic Republic have been among the plots of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic Republic.
For 30 years they have been trying to use such levers against the Islamic Republic, and our laborers have made them disappointed each time.
This shows the close relationship between our working class and the Islamic Republic, a relationship that is based on religious faith and the firm foundations on which the Islamic Republic has been established.
Let us have a look at the nature of this matter.
First and foremost, the material progress of the country is based on two factors.
Production will be thwarted in the absence of knowledge. A country can make progress only if it has access to knowledge. If knowledge is available, but production is not based on this knowledge, the country will make no progress.
During the reign of taghut the problem was that we did not have knowledge, and our production was not knowledge-based and thriving.
But due to the reign of taghut and different other factors, we fell behind. If we are determined to compensate for this backwardness, we must pay attention to knowledge and production. We want to make up for the backwardness, and our nation has started its movement and has made considerable progress already.
I have repeatedly emphasized the issue of knowledge for several years, and scientific progress and generation of knowledge are thankfully well under way in the country. Of course this process should be accelerated.
Both in industrial and agricultural areas, production is of primary importance. A country that fails to engage in production will inevitably become dependant.
Even if all the oil and gas resources of the world were ours, they would not be of much use to us. As you know, there are some countries that are very rich in terms of their mineral and natural resources - including energy resources as well as precious and rare metals - but they are living an absolutely miserable life in abject poverty.
Production must be stepped up in the country, especially knowledge-based production - production that is based on knowledge and scientific findings.
This is in the hands of labor and management.
And the government has a duty to organize labor and management.
It is necessary to implement all of them, but government officials should be careful not to let them become a satanic trap.
The next point that I would like to discuss is the relationship between labor and management.
Both of the views that are common in the modern world - that is, socialist and capitalist views of labor - are wrong.
From a socialist point of view, labor and management are considered enemies of one another. Labor and management are two enemies that are thirsty for one another's blood. This was how they interpreted the relationship.
And the solution they suggested - that is to say, state ownership of all production resources and tools - was also problematic and wrong. Their solution resulted in that disgrace in just a few decades.
The socialist view that considers labor and management as enemies is one view of labor. According to another view, which is completely western, management is considered to be in full control of labor, and labor is seen as a simple tool in the hands of management.
Both views of labor are wrong.
Islam has a different view of labor.
From an Islamic point of view, the relationship between labor and management is one of cooperation.
Labor and management are two elements that produce results when they work in conjunction. Contrary to the Marxist view according to which everything is based on opposition, the Islamic view of labor is one of compassion and cooperation. Thankfully, the Marxist view has disappeared from the philosophical schools of thought in the world.
This is the Islamic view, which is in line with the laws of nature.
This is true of everything else in the world, including natural phenomena as well as political, historical, and economic matters.
In contrast with the Marxist view which is based on opposition, the Islamic view is generally based on compassion, cooperation, and common goals. This is true of labor and management as well - labor and management are seen as two elements that have to work shoulder to shoulder in order to give rise to production.
In addition to material progress, there will be spirituality as well.
That is our view of labor and management.
This is the foundation.
Everybody must channel their efforts in this direction. Policy-makers, politicians, and executive officials should all move in this direction.
Labor and management should make efforts in a truly sincere manner in order to help the country make progress as a result of their work.
My dear people, we have fallen behind.
Of course we have made a lot of progress compared to the time of taghut.
During the reign of taghut, we had to depend on foreigners even for the smallest elements of production and machinery.
And the factories that had been built in the country were used to assemble products imported in parts, and they were purely dependant on foreigners.
We did not know how to design or develop what we needed. Neither did we know how to identify the necessary elements.
Today the Iranian nation is exporting technical services.
Today your country is one of the most advanced and prominent countries in the field of manufacturing dams and power plants.
You are in the process of establishing production lines in many countries of the world.
These things were scoffed at during the reign of taghut.
At that time it would be absurd if you said our country had to go and establish production lines in a highly populated, wealthy, and oil-rich country. Industrial production and other such things were rejected as absurd. But today we have already achieved these things.
Therefore, we have made a lot of progress compared with the past. But we have fallen behind compared with what the Iranian nation and its historical legacy deserve and the position our country deserves among the countries of the world.
There are a lot of things to be done.
That was why I named this year as "The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor ".
Our efforts should not just be focused on removing the immediate obstacles from our path - this is not a great achievement. We must focus our efforts on reaching the peaks.
That is the meaning of "intensified labor".
My dear people, our capabilities are far beyond our current performance.
Sometimes one may be asked to do something that is beyond one's capabilities. This would not be a wise demand.
This is different from asking the same thing of a physically weak person who has no chance of becoming a good wrestler or gymnast even if he spends 20 years on it.
The Iranian nation is like a talented and well-built youth who can become a world-renowned champion if he tries hard enough. The Iranian nation is like that, and it has proven this.
These are not just empty claims. These realities are based on objective findings.
And the experience of the past 30 years made it completely clear that the Iranian nation is capable of achieving these things.
A nation that was helped by no one, a nation that was refused industrial products and technological advances managed to manufacture the second, third, and fourth generation centrifuges. All the countries that enjoy nuclear power and technology were left astonished.
They were asking themselves, "Who did they learn these things from?"
How many countries have access to this kind of technology in the world?
Among all those countries that make extravagant claims regarding their stem cell technology, the Iranian nation suddenly managed to jump to the 8th position in the world.
What does this suggest?
The same is true of all other areas.
What do these things mean?
Yes, we can.
Intensified labor means that we should realize these potentials. The world that has deployed its forces against Iran is the world of arrogance. It is the world that is speaking to us through clenched teeth, the world that parades its bloody claws, the world that tries to create problems whenever it can.
They could not do anything, and I assure you that they will not be able to do anything in the future either.
When one relies on these things and makes serious efforts, one becomes a manifestation of "those who believe and do good deeds" [a phrase frequently repeated in the Holy Quran]. You have faith and engage in good deeds.
In the Holy Quran, faithful people who engage in good deeds have been promised numerous rewards - success in this world, salvation in the hereafter, closeness to Allah the Exalted, honor, and dignity. These are all the result of faith and good deeds.
We should continue treading this path.
May God bestow His grace and blessings on our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) who showed this path to us. He was the one who encouraged us to tread this path. He was the one who helped us.
The more progress our nation makes, the more Allah the Exalted will increase his virtues.
Allah's grace and greetings be upon our martyrs, mujahids, those who made sacrifices on this path, and those who laid down their lives and entered the arena. God's grace be upon those who were martyred or disabled and their families.
I hope all of you will benefit from God's blessings and the prayers of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Imam Khamenei issued message of condolences on passing of Afghanistan’s Marja’ - Khamenei.ir
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,
I would like to express my condolences on the passing away of the mujahid scholar, late Ayatollah Hajj Sheikh Muhammad Asef Mohseni, to all his enthusiasts in Afghanistan and in Iran, and to his honourable family.
Decades of fighting for the cause of God in the political, cultural, scientific and social areas in the Islamic country of Afghanistan, alongside the brave and zealous people of that land, reflects the proud record of this noble clergyman whose enduring blessings are a valuable spiritual legacy. I ask Allah to grant him mercy and paradise.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all sentient beings, and greetings be upon our Master, Muhammad Al-Mustafa, and upon his immaculate household and select companions.
The Ka’bah, the secret behind unity and dignity and the symbol of monotheism and spirituality, is host to enthusiastic and hopeful hearts in the hajj season who have responded to and accepted the call of Allah the Exalted and have rushed towards the birthplace of Islam.
The Islamic Ummah can now see a condensed picture of its vastness and variety and the depth of religious faith that rules the hearts of this righteous religion with the eyes of its representatives who have gathered here from the four corners of the world.
This re-acquaintance with ourselves helps us Muslims to realize the position we deserve in today’s and tomorrow’s world and helps us move towards it.
The spread of the wave of Islamic Awakening in today’s world is a fact that promises a good future for the Islamic Ummah.
Since three decades ago when this powerful movement started with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, our great Ummah has moved forward steadily, removed obstacles from its path and conquered certain strongholds.
The increased complexity of the methods through which the arrogant powers show their enmity and the costly efforts that they make to oppose Islam are also due to these advances.
The widespread propaganda of the enemy to promote fear of Islam, the hasty efforts that it makes to foment discord among Islamic sects and provoke sectarian prejudice, its efforts to make Shia and Sunni appear to be enemies of each other, fomenting discord among Muslim governments, making efforts to exacerbate disagreements and turn them into irremediable enmities and disputes, using intelligence and espionage organizations in order to promote corruption and prostitution among the youth – these are all frantic and confused reactions to the steady movement and firm progress of the Islamic Ummah towards awakening, dignity and liberation. Unlike 30 years ago, today the Zionist regime is no longer an invincible monster.
Today the Palestinian nation is the champion of resistance. The Lebanese nation broke the phony awe of the Zionist regime on its own and won the 33-day war.
And the Iranian nation is the standard-bearer and vanguard of the movement which is moving towards the peaks.
Conversely, the Islamic Awakening is spreading and deepening on a daily basis.
This promising situation which bears good news should on the one hand, push us Muslim nations towards a favorable future more steadily than before and on the other hand, teach us to maintain our vigilance more than ever before.
This public call undoubtedly makes religious scholars, political leaders, intellectuals and youth more committed than others and demands selfless efforts and a pioneering role from them.
The Holy Quran addresses us in a resonating and dynamic manner, “You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men. You enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in Allah.” [Sura Al-e Imran, ayah 110] According to this dignified ayah, the Islamic Ummah is created for humanity.
The purpose behind the creation of this Ummah is to save and benefit humanity.
And the great duty is counseling people to do good, advising them against evil and having firm faith in God.
No good deed is better than delivering nations from the evil claws of the arrogant powers, and no evil is more unacceptable than dependence on the arrogant powers and serving them.
Helping the Palestinian nation and the besieged people of Gaza, sympathy toward and cooperation with the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Kashmir, selfless efforts and resistance against the aggression of America and the Zionist regime, safeguarding the unity of Muslims, fighting evil hands and mercenary tongues that undermine this unity, and spreading awakening and sense of commitment and responsibility among Muslim youth in all Islamic lands – these are great responsibilities that currently lie on the shoulders of prominent figures of the Islamic Ummah.
The magnificent hajj ceremony shows us the appropriate grounds for fulfilling these responsibilities and it calls us to intensified effort and labor.
Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei
Aban 17, 1389
Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met Tuesday morning with Borut Pahor, the President of Slovenia.
Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence referred to the bitter and painful events in the region and the role of some powers in imposing instability and war on nations and reiterated: “The Islamic Republic has always called on independent countries to play an active role in confronting the issue of imposing pressure on nations and it has always asked them to avoid being silent and mere spectators.”
The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution stated that the existence of violent conflicts in countries located in West Asia and the creation of terrorist groups such as DAESH is the result of the interference and imposition of some powers.
Describing the Americans’ anti-DAESH coalition as unsuccessful, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to two viewpoints in explaining the reasons behind this failure: “On the basis of the first viewpoint, the Americans do not have a plan for uprooting DAESH. Like the English who have kept the wound of Kashmir open since the era of colonialism in the Indian subcontinent and which has resulted in two neighboring countries, India and Pakistan, to have discord on this matter until the present time- the Americans too want to act on the issue of DAESH in a way that this problem continues to exist in Iraq without ever being resolved.”
His Eminence said: “On the basis of the second viewpoint, the Americans are willing to resolve the issue of DAESH, but the situation has developed in a way that they are not able to do so.
Of course, the result of both viewpoints has been the same until today. In the present time, Iraq and Syria in particular are in a very bitter and difficult situation.”
The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed to the consequences of creating instability in West Asian countries such as the problems related to refugees, saying: “While the European countries failed to offer refuge to at most a few ten-thousands of refugees, it has been many years that Iran has been hosting about three million people from Afghanistan. Iran has prepared the ground for them to have education and to live a good life and it has behaved towards them in a humanitarian manner with complete patience.” Ayatollah Khamenei stated that one year and eight months of bombarding the people of Yemen and destroying the infrastructure of that country by the Saudi government is another bitter event occurring in the region in the present time.
His Eminence stressed that there are many resources and capacities for Iran and Slovenia to increase their cooperation: “I hope that the future will prove to be firm evidence of present-day negotiations.”
Stating that Iran has completely fulfilled its commitments of the nuclear agreement, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution criticized the other sides for wriggling out of their commitments.
Borut Pahor described his talks with the Iranian officials as very good and said: “We are after deepening our relations with Iran in all areas.”
The President of Slovenia referred to Iran as the main pillar of stability and security in the region and a country that deserves respect.
Praising Iran’s performance during the nuclear negotiations and the astonishing achievements of the country in recent years, Pahor stated: “Slovenia and Iran have many common experiences and numerous areas for cooperation.”
Imam Ayatollah Seyed Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (May 17, 1900 – June 3, 1989) was a Muslim cleric and Marja, and the political leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran which overthrew Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.
Following the Revolution, Imam Khomeini became Grand Leader of Iran — the paramount figure in the political system of the new Islamic Republic — until his demise.
Imam Khomeini was also a highly-influential and innovative Islamic political theorist, most noted for his development of the theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult."
Later, when he was 15, his mother and aunt died in the same year.
Arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Esfahan, but he was attracted, instead, to the seminary in Arak, which was renowned for its scholastic brilliance under the leadership of Ayatollah Sheikh Abdol-Karim Haeri-Yazdi (himself a pupil of some of the greatest scholars of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq). In 1921, Imam Khomeini commenced his studies in Arak.
The following year, Ayatollah Haeri-Yazdi transferred the Islamic seminary to the holy city of Qom, and invited his students to follow. Imam Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved, and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom before being exiled to the holy city of Najaf in Iraq.
He was keenly interested in philosophy and ethics.
Imam Khomeini became a Marja in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi.
Early Political Activity In this time he could represent his religious-political ideas openly. Because the deaths of the leading, although quiescent, Shia religious leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Mohammad Borujerdi (1961), and of the activist cleric Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962) left the arena of leadership open to Imam Khomeini, who had attained a prominent religious standing by the age of 60.
When the White Revolution proclaimed by the Shah's government in Iran called for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women, profit sharing in industry, and an anti-illiteracy campaign in the nation's schools.
In January 1963, the Shah announced a six-point program of reform called the White Revolution, an American-inspired package of measures designed to give his regime a liberal and progressive facade. Imam Khomeini summoned a meeting of his colleagues (other Ayatollahs) in Qom to press upon them the necessity of opposing the Shah's plans. Imam Khomeini persuaded the other senior Marjas of Qom to decree a boycott of the referendum that the Shah had planned to obtain the appearance of popular approval for his White Revolution.
Imam Khomeini issued on January 22, 1963 a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans.
Imam Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programs, issuing a manifesto that also bore the signatures of eight other senior scholars.
He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (March 21, 1963) be cancelled as a sign of protest against government policies.
In the afternoon of Ashura (June 3, 1963), Imam Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feiziyeh Madreseh seminary in which he drew parallels between Yazid and the Shah and warned the Shah that if he did not change his ways, the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.
Following Imam Khomeini's public denunciation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as a "wretched miserable man" and his arrest, on June 5, 1963 (Khordad 15, on the Iranian calendar), three days of major riots erupted throughout Iran with nearly 400 killed.
Opposition to capitulation During November of 1964, Imam Khomeini made a denunciation of both the Shah and the United States, this time in response to the "capitulations" or diplomatic immunity granted to American military personnel in Iran by the Shah.
Life in exile Imam Khomeini spent over 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy city of Najaf in Iraq.
Initially, he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964, where he stayed in the city of Bursa for less than a year.
He was hosted by a Turkish Colonel named Ali Cetiner in his own residence, who couldn't find another accommodation alternative for his stay at the time. Later in October 1965 he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until being forced to leave in 1978, after then-Vice President Saddam Hossein forced him out (the two countries would fight a bitter eight year war 1980-1988 only a year after the beginning of Imam Khomeini’s leadership in Iran and the start of Saddam Hussein’s term in Iraq) after which he went to Neauphle le Château in France.
He believed that the government was an un-Islamic and illegitimate institution usurping the legitimate authority of the supreme religious leader (Faqih), who should rule as both the spiritual and temporal guardian of the Muslim community (Umma).
A modified form of this Velayat-e Faqih system was adopted after Imam Khomeini and his followers took power, and he became the Islamic Republic's first "Guardian" or Grand Leader. In the meantime, however, Imam Khomeini was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah which he worked to build and strengthen over the next decade.
Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah as, for example, "the Jewish agent, the American snake whose head must be smashed with a stone," became common items on the markets of Iran, helped to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign.
Subsequent elections were held to approve of the newly-drafted Constitution. Along with the position of the Grand Leader, the constitution also requires that a president be elected every four years, but only those candidates approved indirectly by the Council of Guardians may run for the office. Imam Khomeini himself became instituted as the Grand Leader for life, and officially decreed as the "Leader of the Revolution."
The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Imam Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership.
The war continued for another six years, with 450,000 to 950,000 casualties on the Iranian side and the use of chemical weaponry by the Iraqi military.
As the costs of the eight-year war mounted, Imam Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations.
As the war ended, the struggles among the clergy resumed and Imam Khomeini’s health began to decline.
Though Rushdie publicly apologized, the fatwa was not revoked, Imam Khomeini explaining that "even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell."
In December 1988 (before the fall of the Berlin Wall), Ayatollah Imam Khomeini sent a letter to USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev predicting the fall of Communism and inviting him to study and research Islam.
In his historical letter he wrote: "It is clear to everyone that Communism should henceforth be sought in world museums of political history." Life under Imam Khomeini Under Imam Khomeini's rule, Sharia (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women.
Life for religious minorities has been mixed under Imam Khomeini and his successors.
By law, several seats in the Parliament are reserved for minority religions.
After eleven days in a hospital for an operation to stop internal bleeding, Imam Khomeini died of cancer on Saturday, June 3, 1989, at the age of 89.
Many Iranians mourned Imam Khomeini's death and poured out into the cities and streets.
Imam Khomeini led an ascetic lifestyle, being deeply interested in mysticism, and was against the accumulation of land and wealth by the clergy.
Family and descendants In 1929, Imam Khomeini married Batol Saqafi Khomeini, the daughter of a cleric in Tehran.
The elder son, Mostafa, was murdered in 1977 while in exile with his father in Najaf, Iraq and SAVAK (the Imperial-era secret police) was accused of his death by Imam Khomeini. Ahmad Khomeini, the younger son, died in 1995. Imam Khomeini's grandson Seyyed Hassan Khomeini, son of the late Seyyed Ahmad Khomeini, is also a cleric and the trustee of Imam Khomeini's shrine.

Tir 28, 1390
And give good news to the humble."
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
It is hajj time, the spring of spirituality and brilliance of monotheism on world horizons. The hajj ceremony is a transparent spring that can purge hajjis of their sins and negligence and restore the brightness of their God-given nature to their heart and soul.
Removing the clothes of ostentation and distinction during the hajj and putting on the identical, white clothes of Ihram symbolize the sincerity of the Islamic Ummah and call Muslims throughout the world to unity and unanimity.
On the one hand, the hajj represents the ayah "So your God is One God, therefore to Him should you submit.
And give good news to the humble." [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 34] On the other hand, it represents the ayah "... the Sacred Mosque, which We have made equally for all men, (for) the dweller therein and the visitor."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] Thus, in addition to being the symbol of monotheism, Ka'bah is the symbol of Islamic solidarity, brotherhood, and equality.
Muslims who have come together from different parts of the world - filled with enthusiasm of making tawaf and visiting the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) shrine - should make the best of this opportunity to strengthen the bonds of brotherhood among themselves, which is the remedy for many great maladies of the Islamic Ummah.
Today we can see clearly that the hand of the ill-wishers of the world of Islam is fomenting discord among Muslims more than ever before.
This is while the Islamic Ummah needs solidarity and unanimity more than any other time.
Muslims should figure out where and how the recent fitnas, wars, explosions, assassinations, and indiscriminate killings in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are being planned.
Why did the regional nations not experience so many hardships and tragic events before the western armies- led by America- domineeringly entered this region as if they had proprietary rights to it? On the one hand, the occupiers label as terrorist the resistance movements of the people of Palestine, Lebanon, and other countries of the world.
On the other hand, they mastermind and lead brutal sectarian and ethnic terrorism among the nations of this region. The Middle East and North Africa were colonized, occupied, and humiliated for more than a century by western governments, including the British and French governments, and subsequently by the American government.
Their natural resources were plundered and their spirit of freedom-seeking was suppressed. Their people were the hostages of the foreign aggressors' greed. And when the Islamic Awakening and national resistance movements made it impossible for international oppressors to continue their oppression, and the issue of martyrdom and ascension to God reappeared as a unique factor in Islamic jihad, the disgraced aggressors resorted to hypocrisy and replaced their old method with new methods of colonialism.
In order to bring Islam to its knees, the hypocritical fiend of colonialism is currently making use of all its capabilities - anything ranging from military coercion, iron-hand policy, and outright occupation to the evil chain of propaganda and to utilization of thousands of slandering centers; from organizing terrorist groups and brutal murders to preparing the ground for corruption, to distributing and promoting drugs, and to destroying the determination, spirits, and morality of the youth; and from all-out political attacks against the centers of resistance to provoking ethnic conceit and sectarian prejudice as well as enmity among brothers.
If suspicion - which is what enemies desire - is replaced with kindness, trust, and unanimity among Muslim nations and Islamic denominations and ethnicities, a large part of the ill-wishers' plots will be foiled and their evil plot of establishing domination over the Islamic Ummah will be thwarted.
The hajj is one of the best opportunities to achieve this lofty goal.
Through cooperation and relying on the common principles discussed in the Quran and Sunnah, Muslims will be able to stand against this hypocritical fiend and defeat it through their willpower and determination.
By following the lessons of the great Imam Khomeini, Islamic Iran has become a prime example of this successful resistance.
They have been defeated in Iran.
Thirty years of machinations, conspiracy, and enmity - anything ranging from staging a coup d'état and causing the eight-year imposed war to imposing sanctions and freezing our assets; from psychological and propaganda warfare and media confrontation to efforts to thwart our scientific growth and acquisition of knowledge- especially nuclear knowledge- to engaging in open provocation and interference in the impressive and significant presidential election - all these turned into scenes of the enemy's defeat, disgrace, and confusion. And the ayah "surely the machinations of the devil is weak" [the Holy Quran, Sura al-Nisa (4), Ayah 76] was once again realized in front of the eyes of the Iranian people.
In any other part of the world, where resistance that was rooted in determination and religious faith deployed the people against the boastful arrogant powers, the ultimate victory was for Muslims and the oppressors were doomed to suffer defeat and disgrace.
The prominent victory gained in the 33-day war on Lebanon as well as the proud and victorious jihad of the people of Gaza during the past 3 years are the living proof of this reality.
I strongly recommend that the hajjis who were graced to make this pilgrimage - especially the ulama and orators of Islamic countries who have attended this divine appointment as well as Friday prayer leaders of the holy shrines [of Mecca and Medina] - identify the urgent duty which they shoulder today through appropriate understanding of the issues.
With all their power, they should explain the plots of the enemies of Islam to their audience and call the people to friendship and unity.
They should seriously avoid whatever causes suspicion among Muslims, and they should inundate their shouts on the arrogant powers and the enemies of the Islamic Ummah, especially America and the Zionists who lead all fitnas.
They should demonstrate expressing hatred towards polytheists in words and action.
I solemnly pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow His guidance, grace, assistance, and mercy on all of us.

Leader Visits Naval Base in Southern Iran - Khamenei.ir
Addressing a group of senior Navy commanders at the base, Ayatollah Khamenei said that there are many capacities and areas for further progress of the Navy.
He stressed that the increased presence and activities of the Navy in international waters will prepare the ground for the Navy to become a genuinely strategic force.
His Eminence said that the presence of Iran's Navy in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal brought about glory for Iran.
He added: "This presence really frightened the enemy because the powerful presence of the Islamic Republic of Iran's naval units in international waters is a source of hope and inspiration for other nations."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not an aggressive country.
Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that executive organizations should cooperate with the Armed Forces in order to address the needs of the Army personnel and their families.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 11, 2010 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a group of high-ranking military and police officials in Tehran.
In the Name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to congratulate all you dear brothers who are shouldering heavy responsibilities on the occasion of Norouz and the arrival of the spring - the season of vitality, freshness, and revitalization. I have been witness to your efforts in different areas. Hopefully, God will accept these efforts from all of you, and He will provide you with the opportunity to enter and succeed in other vast arenas through intensified labor and efforts.
God willing, He will give you the opportunity to help the Armed Forces reach a position that this government and faithful, sincere, and hardworking elements like you deserve.
The existence of sincere and friendly officials is indeed one of the greatest divine blessings for the Armed Forces in this era. One must consider this a truly great blessing and thank God for it.
But this is the general attitude. When I look at you dear commanders, I really thank God for being generous to this nation and assigning such faithful and sincere elements to these great positions of responsibility.
Therefore, you need to be thankful for having a position that gives you the opportunity to play an important role.
Your presence, determination, knowledge, and sincerity can affect the fate and history of the country as well as the future of this nation.
And if this effect is positive, then it will be superior to everything else and nothing will be equivalent to it.
If you can establish a trend or do something that prepares the ground for the prosperity of a nation and brings about religious and material benefits for the nation, your work will be incomparable to all kinds of worshiping, praying, or ordinary services to God's servants. Your work will be superior.
God has provided you and me with this opportunity. Therefore, we need to be thankful for it.
However, just like all great achievements that bring about great benefits, this opportunity necessitates heavy costs and dangerous requirements. "Whoever reaps the benefits should pay the costs."
The higher one's position is, the more serious the dangers are.
And the way to counter these dangers is to fulfill our obligations and fight our illegitimate passions.
If you tread this path - which is not of course an easy task - it will become clear what you should do.
Therefore, we should ask Allah the Exalted not to turn His blessing - that is to say, the opportunity to be in a position where we can play a role in the fate of the country and the people - into retribution for us.
This depends on our own efforts.
And if we ask God for assistance and try hard, it will become possible. As the Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) said, the armed forces of a country act like ramparts.
For this reason, the Armed Forces must always maintain their solidity.
You should consider the Armed Forces from this prospective.
They must always maintain their solidity. If they remain solid, if the sentries on the walls stay constantly vigilant and watch the enemy movements, and if they do not allow any security breaches, the security inside the walls will be safeguarded.
Therefore, strengthening the Armed Forces is a religious principle that cannot be ignored.
The government should pay attention to this point, and the people should support it. The ramparts must remain solid. In all circumstances and regardless of what happens inside the walls, the Armed Forces must continue protecting the country.
This is an analogy, and ramparts mean different things. You are like ramparts. The Army, the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, the Basij Forces, the Police, and the Intelligence Agency are all different kinds of ramparts.
One should be very cautious in such a situation and act in a vigilant, prudent, and courageous manner.
You can see how the heads of governments behave across the world.
The modern world is like this. It is based on lies, deception, oppression, and masked coercion - though they sometimes remove their masks.
As you saw, a few days ago the US President implicitly threatened to use atomic weapons.
That was a very strange remark. The world must not at all pass over this remark.
In the 21st century, which is filled with all those claims in support of peace, human rights, global organizations, fighting terrorism, and other such things, the president of a country stands up and threatens to launch nuclear attacks!
This is a very strange remark in the world.
This will work against their interests. They do not understand.
The clear message that this remark conveys is that the US government is an evil and unreliable government.
They have been trying for years to prove that the Islamic Republic cannot be trusted regarding the nuclear issue.
This is while the Islamic Republic has neither started a war against a country during the past 30 years, nor has it trained terrorists.
They want to say that the Islamic Republic is not trustworthy.
Who cannot be trusted in the world?
That is a very strange remark. That is a source of disgrace for them.
It is necessary to be extremely cautious in such a world.
National determination is more important. National resistance against these storms is more important than military preparedness. Storms come and go, no matter how strong they are.
The problem with the buildings that collapse is that they are not firm enough to withstand the storm long enough. Otherwise storms are not permanent.
If a nation stands firm and maintains its resistance, it will be able to withstand the storms, which come and go. Storms will go away, but a strong nation will stay.
The strength of a government depends on religious faith, the power of resistance, strong determination, and not being deceived by the compliments that are sometimes easily exchanged in many political interactions. But these compliments are there to mask the violent and furious face of people with evil intentions.
The examples abound in our own time, and many such things have happened to us as well as various other countries over the past few decades.
We have been witness to many such things.
It is 30 years now that the Iranian nation has been resisting in the face of various storms, and this Revolution has become stronger.
Today we are far stronger than we used to be 10, 20, or 30 years ago.
We are far more powerful in all areas. We have proven this in the face of various kinds of hostilities.
But as I said, these protective walls must not be vulnerable to any breaches of security.
It is a fact that the people living inside these walls are standing firm, but the walls - that is, the Armed Forces - must be kept strong.
First of all, the Armed Forces must take the threats seriously - I have repeated this several times before.
Your evaluations should not be like political evaluations of threat. Political evaluations say that, for example, the possibility of an enemy attack is weak - 20 or 30 percent.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant.
Fortunately, this is already the case with the Armed Forces.
One can see that in the beginning of the Revolution only a small portion of these talents used to be utilized in different areas.
This experience shows us that our capacities are very high. You should go after innovative activities. You should go after the ideas that have not been explored in the world - regarding warfare and intelligence strategies as well as the methods of dealing with the enemy.
I would especially emphasize the way the Armed Forces are organized.
Fortunately, both the Army and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are heading in this direction.
There have been several innovations in traditional military organization, which have been realized in different ways in the Army and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. Go after innovative ideas.
Of course not every innovation is good.
This has been the case in different parts of the Armed Forces so far. The movement towards self-sufficiency of the Army is one of those innovations, and great achievements have been made since thirty years ago.
In the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution there have been numerous activities in this regard.
Thankfully, we are not short of promising experiences.
Great achievements can be made now. That is almost all I wanted to say today.
All of these things have a spirit as well - that is to say, spirituality, religious insight, and strengthening of religious beliefs which manifest themselves in different ways through the efforts of our active and hardworking brothers in charge of ideological matters in Sepah and elsewhere.
These brothers should pay attention to the issue of priorities, innovations, and intensified labor so that religious practices and ideological commitment are promoted on a daily basis in our Armed Forces. Greetings be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings
Leader’s Message on Martyrdom of Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The Martyrdom of the scholarly and outstanding youth, Shahid Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, imposed another grief on the heart of those who love knowledge and those who are committed to the progress of the Islamic Republic.
All of us share in the grief of the father, mother, wife and child of this innocent, outstanding and proud youth.This cowardly assassination - whose perpetrators and plotters will never dare confess to their evil crime and accept responsibility for it, just like the other crimes committed by the international network of state terrorism - has been planned or helped by the intelligence services of CIA and Mossad and it is a sign that the arrogant powers of the world, led by America and Zionism, have reached a dead end in the face of the determined, pious and progressive people of Islamic Iran.
This outrageous and brutal behavior will fail as well and they will not achieve their evil and malevolent goals.
The accelerated scientific progress and the conquering of the peaks of knowledge - which has been promoted by the determination of pious, proud and competent youth such as Shahid Ahmadi-Roshan - is independent of individuals. This is a historic movement that is rooted in an unbreakable national will.
We will continue this path powerfully and with a firm determination to the disappointment of the leaders of the camp of arrogance and hegemony and we will keep showing the progress of our great nation to the spiteful and envious enemies.
Of course, we will never neglect punishing the perpetrators of this crime and those behind it.I extend my condolences to the parents, wife and child of this honorable martyr, to the scientific and academic community of the country and to all those who love our comprehensive scientific movement and are committed to it and I pray to God to bestow patience and divine calm on them.
I also pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow the highest position on this honorable martyr in the hereafter and I pay tribute to the memory of Shahid Ali-Mohammadi, Shahid Shahriari and Shahid Rezaeinejad.

Leader's Response to President Rouhani's Letter on Nuclear Negotiations - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the letters written on November 24, 2013 by President Rouhani and Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
To the blessed presence of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution- Hazrat Ayatollah Khamenei (may his achievements continue),
With peace and abundant greetings, I thank God Almighty because in the first months of the administration of wisdom and hope, your revolutionary children managed to prove - during difficult and complicated negotiations in international arenas - that the people of Iran have the right to follow their nuclear activities.
Therefore, the path for future lofty steps towards preserving the technological and economic progress of the country has opened up.
These negotiations showed that we can take future steps towards resolving all disagreements in a determined way. Without a doubt, this success is the result of the attention of God, the guidance of the Leadership of the government and the complete support of the Iranian nation.
The final success on this path depends on the continuation of your guidance and on the support and assistance of the noble and patient people of Iran. The clear results of this initial agreement include the formal recognition of the nuclear rights of Iran and the preservation of the nuclear achievements of our country.
Besides, the process of imposing oppressive sanctions being halted, part of the illegal pressures that were exerted through these unilateral sanctions have been lifted and the collapse of this system - which is based on imposing sanctions - has already begun.
As a result of this innovation of Islamic Iran and this resistance of the great people of Iran, superpowers have reached the conclusion that sanctions and pressures will get them nowhere.
As Iran had announced from the beginning, superpowers came to the conclusion that there is no way to reach an agreement except with mutual respect and with honorable negotiations. This is an issue which, unfortunately, the other party noticed late.
Without a doubt, this agreement is to the advantage of all regional countries, it will further peace and global progress and it is in line with the principle of win-win.
I would like to congratulate you, the Leader of the Revolution, on this divine blessing and I express my gratitude to you for your guidance and support. Also, I would like to thank the great people of Iran for their complete support.
Commemorating the memory of our nuclear martyrs, I would like to renew the sincere pledge of this administration to render services to the people and I ask you and all the people to continue praying for this administration.
In the Name of Allah the Exalted, Mr. President, Such achievements [as written by you in your letter], deserve appreciation and we express our gratitude to the negotiating team and other officials.
Undoubtedly, divine blessings and the prayers and the support of the Iranian nation have brought about this achievement, and God willing, it will be the same in the future.
Resistance against avarice should always be the main standard in the forward movement for the officials in charge of this sector and so it shall remain, God willing.

Leader's Message on Ayatollah Rezvani's Demise - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the message issued on April 20, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on Ayatollah Rezvani's demise.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
I would like to express my condolences to the honorable family of Ayatollah Rezvani, on the demise of Ayatollah Hajj Sheikh Gholam Reza Rezvani (may God bestow paradise on him) who was a great Islamic jurisprudent. I extend my condolences to all those who respect him and to his students.
That great scholar was among the trustworthy students of Imam Khomeini (r.a.). He had certain responsibilities such as his responsibility in the Guardian Council. By Allah's favor, his services - which included cooperation with different organizations in illustrating fiqhi views of the Guardian Council - will be accepted by Allah the Exalted who will bestow paradise on him.
I ask Allah the Exalted to raise the position of this outstanding cleric.

Leader Meets Teachers - Khamenei.ir
In a meeting with thousands of teachers from across the country, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that teachers have a key role in educating innovative and pious individuals in the country.
The Iranian nation should achieve such progress that it can turn into an unquestioned authority for Muslim nations and intellectuals regarding various intellectual, scientific, political, and social matters. 0.189346 82.txt 1290-Leader-Meets-Teachers.txt Wannan wani nauyi ne na tarihi na al'ummar Iran. And this is the historical responsibility of the Iranian nation.
Ayatollah Khamenei reiterated: "Unlike some so-called religious intellectuals who used to present non-religious concepts as religion, Shahid Motahhari used to present genuine religious concepts to his audience on the basis of their immediate needs and questions."
He stressed that Shahid Motahhari was not after fame or an academic and religious position. "During his life, he fought misguided and heretic thoughts as vigorously as he fought reactionary attitudes and dogmatism, and this was one of the prominent characteristics of Shahid Motahhari," he noted.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that Shahid Motahhari's works have withstood the test of time and reiterated: "The sincerity of that great man is the reason why after the passage of 30 years since his martyrdom and in spite of various advances made ever since his works can still be used to address many of today's needs."
Ayatollah Khamenei added: "Whenever a profound thought is accompanied by sincerity, Allah the Exalted bestows such blessing on the thought that it turns into an inexhaustible resource for the people of society, and Shahid Motahhari's works are like that."
His Eminence said that the greatness of education is exemplified by the effect of Shahid Motahhari's scholarly and cultural works.
He referred to the key role of teachers and reiterated: "If teachers constantly take the greatness of their role into consideration, their faith, motivation, and efforts will be doubled."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the effect of teachers on the individual and social characteristics of children and adolescents is far beyond the effect of parents, media, social factors, genetic inheritance, morality, and spirituality. "Having such a prominent role, teachers can educate faithful, motivated, patient, hopeful, innovative, thoughtful, and scholarly individuals who are committed to pursuing public interests and reaching the peaks of individual and social perfection."
Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that if teachers fail to realize the importance of their role, they may educate students who are not useful to society.
His Eminence emphatically called on teachers to develop faith in the importance of their role and added: "It is essential to plan fundamental changes in the education system, and this must be carried out considering the needs, lofty ideals, and human capacities of the country. But this does not mean that we should stand by and wait until these fundamental changes are made."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the backwardness of the country, and said that compensating for this shortcoming necessitates great action.
Iran should achieve the position it deserves, and it should turn into a perfect role model for the world of Islam.
Ayatollah Khamenei reiterated: "In order to achieve this great goal, the Iranian nation should make use of all its power, human and intellectual capacities, and God-given talents."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the moral condition of the modern world as extremely bad and reiterated: "It is possible to change this appalling fate of humanity, but the first prerequisite is to make great changes in the country and turn it into a material and spiritual role model."
Ayatollah Khamenei further reiterated: "Education is the basis of all kinds of change in the country.
And the Iranian nation will continue treading its path in a firm manner."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated: "On the path to progress, the most important matter is that everybody should identify and fulfill their responsibility appropriately."
Leader Urges Fulfillment of Bilateral Agreements - Khamenei.ir The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei met today with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and his accompanying delegation.

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the bilateral agreement between Iran and Iraq to expel the members of the Munafeqeen grouplet from Iraq and said that the Islamic Republic expects that the agreement be fulfilled soon.
Mr. Talabani said that the development of the ties between the two countries will bring about peace and stability in the region and added that despite the concerns about the expansion of ties between the two countries, we consider the strengthening of our relations with the Islamic Republic as useful for our country and the region as well.
Leader Meets with Teachers - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this morning with thousands of teachers from across the country. Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence said that the most important characteristic of teachers is that they can turn their students into outstanding scholars and righteous, knowledgeable and capable individuals.
Ayatollah Khamenei called on the people, the educational system and teachers to appreciate the role and position of teachers and reiterated: "Correct, wise and caring actions of teachers can definitely lay a firm foundation in society in order to solve many of the cultural, ethical and behavioral problems."
His Eminence referred to the spread of public education to the remotest parts of the country and added: "In recent years praiseworthy measures have been adopted in the educational system and the most important measure among them was preparing the document for transforming the educational system, and the main mission is to implement the document."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the important role of the educational system in training the youth and promoting moral virtues in society, further stating: "The educational system should create role models for our youth and teenagers, and the best role models are our martyred youth and teenagers."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated: "Besides the educational system, the organizations in charge of public relations, the IRIB, governmental organizations and the clergy have an important role to play in presenting role models in society."
He added: "By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation is present on the scene and it is insightful and aware of the conditions. The Iranian nation knows its enemy well and will not be deceived by his hypocritical pretense of friendship."
Ayatollah Khamenei said that election is a manifestation of being present on the scene and reiterated: "With the conflict going on among the materialistic powers, the Iranian nation should always be present on the scene and maintain its vigilance in order to be able to defend its rights and the rights of its future generations."
At the end of his statements, Ayatollah Khamenei said that there are bright prospects for the Iranian nation and added: "By Allah's grace, the future of Islamic Iran will definitely be better than its current conditions."
Imam Khamenei's message of condolences to the President - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,
Dear Hujjatul Islam Rouhani, Respected President,
I would like to express condolences on the passing of your respectable sister.
I ask Allah, the Exalted, to bestow His forgiveness and blessings on her.

Leader Meets with Officials of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ambassadors - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met Wednesday morning with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Iranian ambassadors and charge d'affairs. Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence described the diplomatic apparatus of the country as the fighter in the front lines of defending the goals and the national interests and resources of the people of Iran.
Referring to the significance of diplomacy, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: "Intelligent and active diplomacy can bring about many important political, economic, human and social achievements.
This truth indicates the weight and position of diplomacy in the management of a country."
Ayatollah Khamenei stated that the recent events in the region are a manifestation of this truth, reiterating: "Certain powers tried to safeguard their interests with bullying and weapons, but they failed.
His Eminence described the present era as the period of transition to a new global order, stressing: "As well as the traditional actors, new actors have entered the arena in Asia, Africa and Latin America and they are trying to strengthen their position in the upcoming new order."
Otherwise, we will not benefit from the necessary position in the new world."
Expressing his agreement with the statements that the President had made two days ago about interaction with the whole world, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: "There are two exceptions in this regard: the Zionist regime and America."
He stressed: "Not only will establishing relations and negotiating with America not bring the Islamic Republic any advantage - except for a few special cases - but it will also be harmful for it.
Some people used to pretend that if we sit at the negotiating table with the Americans, many of our problems will be solved.
Of course, we knew that this was not the case, but last year's events proved this truth again and again."
His Eminence reiterated: "In the past, there were no relations between our officials and American officials, but last year, it was decided that officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs make contacts and negotiate with American officials because of the sensitive nuclear issue and the issue of making an experience that we referred to previously.
However, not only did these contacts not bring us any benefit, but the Americans' tone also became harsher and more insulting and they expressed more unreasonable expectations during negotiations and in public podiums.
Of course, in these negotiations, our officials gave them sharper rejoinders in response to their unreasonable expectations.
But in general, it became clear that unlike what some people think, negotiations are not helpful at all."
He touched on the issue of increasing sanctions against Iran, saying: "Not only did the Americans not decrease enmities, but they also increased sanctions.
Of course, they say that that these sanctions are not new, but in fact, they are new.
Therefore, negotiations in the area of sanctions have not been helpful either."
The task that Dr. Zarif and his friends have started and in which they have made good achievements will continue.
But this was another precious experience for everyone so that we understand that establishing relations and speaking to the Americans will not have any effect on reducing their enmity."
His Eminence stressed that the Islamic Republic will not establish any relation with the Zionist regime at all.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution highlighted the events in Gaza, adding: "The Palestinians' logic on the issue of the truce is cogent.
As the Palestinians say, there should be a punishment for all these crimes which is an end to the siege of Gaza and no fair-minded individual can deny this legitimate request."
At the end of his statements, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the issue of Iraq, reiterating: "By Allah's favor, when the new prime minister is elected, the problems will be solved and the government will be formed so that it can teach a good lesson to those who have decided to instigate fitna in Iraq."
Leader's Message of Condolence on the Demise of Ayatollah Montazeri - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
He was a knowledgeable Islamic jurisprudent and a prominent scholar, and many students benefited from his knowledge.
He spent a major portion of his life serving the late Imam Khomeini's movement. He made many selfless efforts and endured many hardships on this path.
During the latter stages of Imam Khomeini's auspicious life, he went through a difficult and critical test, and I ask Allah the Exalted to bestow mercy and forgiveness on him due to the hardships he endured.
I extend my condolences to all of his family members, particularly to his honorable wife and children, and I pray to God to bestow mercy and forgiveness on him.

Azar 29, 1388
Leader Meets with Officials in Charge of Elections - Khamenei.ir Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met Monday morning with officials in charge of presidential and city and village councils elections.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described insulting the tomb of Hujr ibn Adi, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) companion, as a tragic event, stressing: "Muslims - particularly scientific, political and religious personalities of the world of Islam - should carry out their responsibility in the face of this malevolent move and they should prevent the fire of fitna from spreading." Ayatollah Khamenei described elections as the great manifestation of national and Islamic trust, adding: "The Guardian Council, organizations in charge of holding and supervising elections and organizations in charge of creating a safe and healthy environment for elections are responsible for safeguarding this great trust. They have important and valuable responsibilities which will exert a permanent influence on the country."
He said that the elections on the 24th of Khordad are more important, in certain ways, than previous elections, stating: "Holding the presidential elections and city and village councils elections at the same time is one of the reasons why the upcoming elections are very significant."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the establishment of councils in all cities and villages throughout the country as the manifestation of the constant presence of the people in the arena of making decisions for the country. Addressing officials, the people and outstanding personalities, he said: "Paying attention to presidential elections should not make you ignore the significance of city and village council elections."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the presence of the people on the scene as the main reason for the strength of the Islamic Republic, stating: "In the Islamic Republic, if the people are not present on the scene, The Islamic Republic means nothing.
The Islamic Republic means the widespread presence of the people of Iran and their movement towards ideals and great and practical goals.
This is the meaning of the Islamic Republic." Ayatollah Khamenei added: "The Islamic Republic and its power rely on the hearts, emotions and feelings of the people.
If, over these 30-something years, the enemies have not managed to undermine the Islamic Republic, the reason is this.
His Eminence stressed: "By Allah's favor and grace, the upcoming election will be one of our best and most enthusiastic elections."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to a number of events which took place in the year 1388, saying: "In that year, if those individuals who inflicted a loss on the country and the people and those who imposed unnecessary expenses on the country had observed the law, that situation would not have been brought about.
If we enter the arena for the sake of God and for carrying out our responsibilities, then winning and losing are meaningless.
Elsewhere in his statements, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution described destroying the tomb of Hujr ibn Adi, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) companion, and insulting his body as a tragic event, further adding: "Another reason why this is a tragic event is that there are some people among Muslims and the Islamic Ummah who have backward, superstitious and malevolent ideas and who consider commemorating outstanding and enlightened personalities of the early Islamic era as a polytheistic and blasphemous move.
This is really a disaster." Ayatollah Khamenei added: "These are the people whose forefathers destroyed the tombs of the Imams (a.s.) in al-Baqi.
The day when Muslims throughout the world of Islam - from the Indian Subcontinent to Africa - rose up against them, they would have completely annihilated the pure tomb of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) if they had had the courage."
His Eminence reiterated: "They make these evil moves under the pretext that commemorating such people is a kind of worship.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution stated that the reaction of Sunni Muslims to this event is indicative of their deep understanding, further stressing: "If these moves are not vigorously condemned by Muslims and if academic, intellectual and political personalities do not carry out their responsibilities in the face of these people, such fitna will not end in this. A disaster will befall the Islamic community and the fire of this fitna will spread on a daily basis.
Muslims should prevent such fitnas through political actions, fatwas and articles which should be written by intellectuals and outstanding and political personalities in the world."
He stressed: "They use tricks, but divine tricks will definitely outwit their tricks and will block the path of the movement which wants to create obstacles in the way of the Islamic Ummah and its progress."
Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met Sunday afternoon with navy commanders and officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army on the occasion of Navy Day.
Describing the achievements and capabilities of the Navy in the areas of manpower, command and technical affairs as noteworthy and praiseworthy, His Eminence stressed the importance of finalizing projects, preserving strength, and avoiding hastiness in carrying out tasks, reiterating: “The requirement for eliminating shortcomings is having firm determination and refusing to give in to limitations and restrictions.”
The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution highlighted the importance of the seafaring industry in the progress of some countries and added: “Our country enjoys vast sea borders and a long history in seafaring. Therefore, the power and capability of the Navy of the Islamic Republic should befit the status of our Islamic government and the history of this country.”
Ayatollah Khamenei stated that the powerful presence of the Navy in international waters will increase the power and capability of the country. He said: “The depth of presence in international waters should increase.”
His Eminence stressed the necessity of pursuing projects and tasks until the desired results are produced, saying: “Leaving tasks unfinished will raise certain questions and it will be problematic. Unfortunately in the present time, this situation is witnessed in some areas of the country, an example of which is the issue of the extraordinary high salaries.
This issue is one of the important issues whose result was not clarified for the people and they still have some questions about it in their minds.”
The necessity to preserve strength and to avoid hastiness and carelessness in affairs was another point that the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution raised: “Every task should be started in a powerful way because hastiness in affairs will be problematic. Unfortunately, there are certain examples in this regard as well.”
Ayatollah Khamenei pointed to the issue of the nuclear negotiations and added: “In those negotiations, there were many discussions about sanctions, but in the present time, the U.S. Congress is bringing up the issue of renewing sanctions and they claim that this is not a new set of sanctions, but that it is a renewal of them!”
His Eminence mentioned: “There is not any difference between imposing new sanctions and re-imposing the old ones again after the end of their term.
The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated that the emergence of such problems is due to hastiness in carrying out tasks: “When we are in a rush to finish tasks soon and to get some results, we ignore the details.
Therefore, we should be careful so that tasks are carried out in a sound and firm manner and at appropriate speed.”
Leader Meets Police Officials - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this afternoon with the Interior Minister and a group of police officials and commanders.
Speaking at the meeting, His Eminence said that one of the most important duties of the police force is to establish moral and psychological security in society. Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the remarks he made yesterday about the recent events and added: "Unfortunately the attitude that certain newspapers adopted towards these remarks caused discord instead of a sense of peace."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated that it is necessary to avoid provoking tension in society through the mass media.
Ayatollah Khamenei reminded the audience of the disagreements among government officials and political activists during the leadership of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and added that Imam Khomeini (r.a.) would repeatedly tell government officials to say whatever they liked in their meetings, but avoid making their disagreements public.
His Eminence referred to the efforts made by foreign media to magnify certain disagreements among Iran's government officials and stressed that the statements of government officials must not suggest that there is discord among them. He added that if there are any disagreements, government officials must not reveal their dissatisfaction to the people and give foreign media a pretext to broadcast negative propaganda against the Islamic Republic.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the people have a high morale and added: "The peace in society and the firm and conscious movement of the people towards the ideals is nothing but a divine blessing, and it is necessary to appreciate this blessing."
Elsewhere in his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei expressed his gratitude for the efforts made by police officials and commanders during the New Year holidays and throughout last year. He reiterated: "The people can see these efforts and services, and they appreciate them."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that one of the necessities of establishing moral security in society is to make the police force invulnerable.
He added that the police cannot be made invulnerable except through adhering to religious principles. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the situation of the police has improved a lot since last year and added: "Our police officials and commanders should not be satisfied with the current level of success, rather they should make efforts to reach the peak."
His Eminence said that he is satisfied with the existing harmony between the Ministry of Interior and the police force, and he urged them to increase this harmony.
