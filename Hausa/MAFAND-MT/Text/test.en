Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia.
The full text of the statement is as follows:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
These days the Horn of Africa and particularly tragedy-hit Somalia are witness to one of the most painful human crises in which drought and famine are threatening the lives of millions of Muslim people of Somalia, especially women and children, in the silence and indifference of international organizations.
For this purpose and considering the Leader's special attention to helping the famine-stricken people of Somalia, the philanthropic and Muslim people of Iran are hereby invited to rush to the aid of the Muslim people of Somalia in this month of mercy and blessing and to send their monetary and non-monetary aid to the people of Somalia through the organizations in charge.
Leader’s Message on the Occasion of 20th National Conference on Prayers - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of message.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
By their nature human beings, require and are eager to worship God and to show humility before Him, God who is the Creator of all goodness and beauties. And prayer fulfills this need.
By making prayers obligatory, divine religions quench the thirst of human nature and save it from confusion and misguidance concerning the quenching of this thirst.
Repeating prayers every day and night is an opportunity and a blessing which saves human beings from drowning in lack of vigilance. It gives human beings the opportunity to have a conscious presence of the heart before God.
When divine remembrance, prayers and worship combine with the fabric of social life, they reveal the miracle of Islam in the constellation of divine commands.
The mosque is a manifestation of this combination.
Congregational prayers in the mosque with other believers, is taking part in a divine celebration and this makes the rain of divine mercy heavier and more pleasing.
The blessedness of prayers imbues and enlightens the atmosphere of mosques. And speaking righteous words and teaching religion, ethics and politics in that atmosphere pleases one's heart and soul more than any other atmosphere and it gives a divine orientation to the life of the individual and society.
This is how the mosque should be viewed.
The spirit of the mosque instills dynamism and motivation into the body of life.
Wherever there is organized life, the mosque is the main center.
In the structure of cities and villages, in schools and universities and in other places - from marketplaces to airports, roads, terminals, nursing homes, hospitals, parks and holiday resorts - the mosque should be the pole and the pivot.
Everywhere the mosque should be clean, beautiful and calming.
The material and spiritual management of the mosque, which is shouldered by the clergy in charge of the mosque, should be wise, responsible and even affectionate.
If the mosque achieves the quality it deserves, a lot of material and spiritual burdens will be removed from the shoulders of society, the people and government officials.
In the hope of reaching that day and greetings be upon the one remaining with Allah on earth (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake)
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
October 11, 2011
Leader Meets with Lebanese Prime Minister - Khamenei.ir His Eminence stressed that Iran will spare no effort to aid the progress and development of Lebanon.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the negations conducted in Tehran and reiterated: "The ground is prepared for the strengthening of the relations between the two countries, and these relations should be further expanded, especially in trade, development and construction sectors."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the continuous attacks of the Zionist regime on Lebanon and added: "If it can, the Zionist regime will go beyond Beirut and even Tripoli in order to besiege Syria.
But resistance is the only deterring factor against the usurping Zionist regime."
His Eminence stressed that Lebanon is the only Arab country that has managed to defeat the Zionist regime and reiterated: "Resistance is the only factor that the enemies of Lebanon are unable to confront.
Therefore, it is necessary to appreciate it."
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "As long as the Zionist regime exists, Lebanon will need resistance."
Ayatollah Khamenei expressed his satisfaction with the good relationship between Saad Hariri and Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah as well as the officials of the Lebanese resistance forces. "These relationships should be strengthened more than before."
His Eminence stressed that the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the unity and independence of Lebanon. He added: "Lebanon is a multi-religious country, and the followers of different religions and sects have lived together peacefully for many years, but some people are after causing turmoil and religious conflicts.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to his meeting with the former Lebanese Prime Minister the late Rafik Hariri and spoke about his efforts for the progress of Lebanon.
In this meeting, Prime Minister Saad Hariri expressed his satisfaction over his meeting with the Leader of the Islamic Revolution and said: "We consider the Islamic Republic of Iran as a friend and brother of Lebanon. Iran has always helped the people of Lebanon during hard times."
He added that the Lebanese government wants to expand its relations with Iran in economic, political and cultural areas.
The most important goal of the Lebanese government is to preserve and strengthen national unity, movement within the framework of commonalities and resistance against invasion.
An interview with Ayatollah Taskhiri, chairman of the International Forum for Proximity of Islamic Denominations, about the hajj messages issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
After sending Iranian hajj pilgrims to Saudi Arabia after a long delay, in order to coordinate between Iran and Saudi Arabia, certain negotiations took place between the officials of the two countries.
Ayatollah Taskhiri was a member of the Iranian delegation which was sent to Saudi Arabia to negotiate with Saudi officials.
Every year the Leader of the Islamic Revolution issues a message to the great hajj congregation during the hajj season, which contains important points for Muslims of the world.
In your opinion, what is the philosophy behind these messages?
There are a few points that I should mention before answering this question.
First of all, hajj â€“ which is an Islamic obligation â€“ pursues great goals.
Based on the Holy Quran, maybe the biggest goal of hajj is the connection between the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the prophets throughout history. That is to say, according to Sura al-Baqara, it began with the creation of Adam and Eve when angels prostrated in front of them, their experiences in paradise, their banishment to earth and finally their use of their heavenly experiences, including committing sins, repenting and complete submission to divine commands.
In order to describe each of these stages, the Holy Quran uses the phrase â€œand whenâ€ which recount the story of all prophets until Prophet Ibrahim when God says, â€œAnd when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them.
He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men.
My covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ [The Holy Quran, 2: 124] It refers to the leadership of God's righteous servants. â€œMy covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ This is where the issue of hajj is mentioned: â€œAnd when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim.â€ God brings up the issue of hajj in the middle of the story about the path of His prophets and it appears that Prophet Ibrahim is considered the one who determines the path and the goals of hajj.
The second goal has also been mentioned: making human beings go back to their nature and to the natural path of surrendering to God. And this goal is manifested in all rituals of hajj. Therefore, hajj contains great goals and one of these goals is renouncing polytheists [bara'a] and Prophet Ibrahim was the most important manifestation of renouncing polytheists.
All these things show the unity of Muslims and the Islamic Ummah. These goals are realized during hajj.
A manifestation of these goals is mentioned in every one of the messages issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
Reviving hajj means reviving the Islamic Ummah and this is the philosophy behind the existence of these messages and the insistence of the Islamic Republic and the Leader on this issue.
Implementing the hajj messages would initiate the movement of the Islamic Ummah.
According to Islamic narrations, â€œHajj is the flag of Islam.â€ What does â€œflag of Islamâ€ mean?
As long as the flag of an army keeps flying during a battle, it means the army is has not been defeated and the battle is supposed to continue.
Therefore, reviving hajj is one of the great goals that the Islamic Republic pursues in order to bring about Islamic Awakening.
In the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, these points have been frequently highlighted.
Yes, unfortunately we have failed to understand the importance of the hajj messages. We have failed to make others realize the importance of these messages. We have also failed to convey these messages to those who are far from us.
Our mass media, our pilgrims and others are making efforts in this regard, but these efforts are not enough considering the importance of these messages.
In order to reach this goal, all media outlets, all cultural advisors, all public relations facilities and all media networks that we have at our disposal should try to convey these messages to different parts of the world.
We need to make more efforts in this regard.
Not like this. Only the King of Saudi Arabia issues a message for public relations purposes.
These messages are made public on the Day of Bara'a.
But after the conflicts that took place â€“ which was the reason why Iranians did not go on hajj pilgrimage for a few years â€“ certain agreements were made. I was a member of the delegation which was sent to Saudi Arabia for negotiations.
The two sides agreed that Iranian pilgrims should not come together in Mecca and that they could only do so on the day of Arafa to listen to the message of their Leader. Did you also agree to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina during the same negotiations?
No, the agreement to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina was reached in other negotiations. This agreement was a separate issue, which was settled after a lot of conflicts and groundwork.
We claim that the hajj messages are conveyed to Muslim nations.
What effects have these messages produced so far?
Many pilgrims from different countries take part in hajj ceremonies.
These messages are handed out during hajj. They are translated into around ten languages and are handed out in Mena and other places during the hajj season.
These messages are also broadcast in different languages in some of our media and they have had a good effect on the hearts of Muslims although the entire system of global arrogance as well as Arab and Islamic governments try to stifle these messages.
One of these messages was once published in a newspaper in England: the entire network of global Zionism protested against that newspaper and created problems for it.
When did this happen?
The Zionists try to prevent the messages from being published.
And not only does the government of Saudi Arabia refuse to help in this regard, but it sometimes tries to prevent these messages from being published.
Of course in the past few years there have been few cases of such arrests, but they try to stifle these messages in Saudi Arabia.
Sometimes we try to publish the messages in foreign newspapers and we pay the money, but they do not publish them.
Many newspapers do not allow this or they are prohibited from publishing these messages.
In European and even Islamic countries.
They strongly refuse to publish these messages. But as I said, we have been negligent too.
What is the nature of these messages?
During hajj the pilgrims are representatives of the entire Islamic Ummah.
That is to say, it is the congregation of the entire Islamic Ummah with the purpose of getting closer to God. The pilgrims are trained with slogans, songs and identical rituals.
Hajj pilgrims should restrain their eyes.
They should restrain their mouth and tongue.
The things that should be avoided as haraam during ihram are a kind of training for hajj pilgrims.
I have extracted the themes of the messages issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution over the past few years and I can share the result with you if you like. Please go ahead.
If you study the Leader's messages, you will see that the first point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in structuring the Islamic Ummah.
This is the goal of the Leader's hajj messages.
For example, one point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in eliminating the weak points of the Islamic Ummah.
The next point concerning the role of hajj is that these messages stress the fact that hajj is the flag of Islam.
In one of his messages, the Leader pointed out that hajj is a manifestation of the movement of the Islamic Ummah and that it defines the role of political Islam.
One pillar of hajj is tawaf around the House of God.
That is to say, the entire Ummah is supposed to revolve around and adhere to the guidance of Allah the Exalted.
In sum, the first pivot that is mentioned in these messages is the role of hajj in the civilizational course of the Islamic Ummah.
The second issue is the role of hajj in moral education of individuals and society.
This is a theme that is present in all of the hajj messages.
The issue of self-purification and appreciating this opportunity in the holy places that are related to hajj, are definitely mentioned somewhere in the messages.
Showing the greatness of Islam and its messages is the third theme that is mentioned in these messages.
They highlight the greatness of Islamic solutions to the problems of humanity.
Highlighting the issue of Muslim unity is another theme that is highlighted in these messages.
These messages have tried to deepen and spread Islamic Awakening.
Certain manifestations of this unity are also mentioned in these messages: for example, pilgrims wear identical clothes, follow the same path, chant the same slogans, adopt the same positions, make tawaf around the same center and other such things.
In last year's message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that Ka'bah represents monotheism and that it is the symbol of moving towards Muslim unity.
These messages also explain the great facilities of the Islamic Ummah â€“ its material and spiritual facilities and its geographic and cultural capacities. These messages remind the Islamic Ummah of its great facilities, which are unfortunately being plundered by the enemies.
Disclosing the plots of the arrogant powers is another theme in these messages.
In all these messages, the Leader mentions the evil plots of the arrogant powers to annihilate the Islamic Ummah.
The messages explain the crimes that are being committed as well as the most important issues and developments in Islamic territories, ranging from the distortion of Islamic truths to enmities, ethnocentric fitnas, spread of corruption, numerous killings and the propaganda against the Islamic Ummah.
All these threats â€“ which have increased after 9/11 â€“ have been mentioned by the Leader in his messages.
Because the plots of the enemies to occupy the world of Islam were foiled by the Revolution and Islamic Awakening, they started to divide the Islamic Ummah and spread corruption.
Therefore, in his messages the Leader of the Islamic Revolution says that the arrogant powers are an enemy of oppressed people and human rights, a supporter of terrorism and a promoter of hegemony and hypocrisy in the world of Islam. Of course disclosing the role of the mercenary regimes in the region is another important theme. These regimes try to fulfill the goals of colonialism and take away the essence of hajj: these things have also been mentioned in the messages.
Introducing the Islamic Republic as a successful model â€“ which has stood up against the arrogant powers, implemented Islam in all aspects of life, pioneered Muslim unity, promoted solidarity between the leadership and the people and represented religious democracy and support for the oppressed â€“ is another theme in these messages. Normally, all the messages which are issued by the Leader mention one or more of these themes.
In what ways has stressing these themes affected other countries?
Has it received any feedback from the prominent figures and politicians of Muslim and Arab countries?
Whenever we travel to other countries and take part in different conferences, everybody mentions these points and praises these messages. We travel to around 50 countries every year and we speak to different Muslim individuals, groups and leaders, particularly political leaders and activists of different Islamic countries.
That is to say, in spite of our weaknesses in making these messages publicly available, they have had an invigorating effect wherever they have been published.
Currently, public diplomacy is being discussed in the world. That is to say, leaders of countries are addressing the people rather than governments.
Can we think of these hajj messages as one of the pillars of public diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and as a means to export the Revolution?
One of the beautiful ways of exporting the message of the Revolution is through the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini and the Leader.
Issuing these messages is one way of invigorating the hajj congregation, responding to the efforts to take away the essence of hajj and highlighting the role of hajj in the life of Muslims. And I believe these messages have had their effects although â€“ as I said â€“ we have not made enough efforts to make them available to everybody.
The problem is that many hajj pilgrims travel a long distance and take a lot of trouble, but they fail to understand the message of hajj.
According to Islamic narrations, â€œThe light of hajj does not dim on the pilgrims unless they sin.â€ That is to say, hajj pilgrims return with the light of hajj and this light shows itself both in their human nature and their activities in society until they commit a sin, which gradually destroys the light.
I hope hajj pilgrims will make efforts to receive the light of hajj and to preserve the message of hajj so that hajj can have its effect on educating the Islamic Ummah.
Leader’s Speech to Shia and Sunni Clergy in Kermanshah - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with Shia and Sunni clergy in the city of Kermanshah.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate household and chosen companions, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
All-Wise Allah says in His Book: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah, and Allah is sufficient to take account. [The Holy Quran, 33: 39]
For me, one of the enjoyable and pleasant meetings during my trips is the meetings that I arrange with our honorable scholars and luminaries - who are rendering services in different provinces across the country - and young seminarians who are like saplings and buds in the area of religious education.
Thankfully, tonight you dear seminarians and religious scholars - both Shia and Sunni - are present in this meeting, which is an enjoyable and valuable opportunity for me, an opportunity that is accompanied by spiritual satisfaction.
I would like to make a few points in this meeting.
I had the opportunity to meet him many times in his home in Kermanshah and exchange views with him.
I had met him previously in a meeting that had been arranged for Friday prayer leaders of Kermanshah province in Islamabad, which was attended by the late Shahid Saduqi from Yazd as well as other people.
Friday prayer leaders of Kermanshah province held the meeting while the enemy was dropping bombs on the city.
He used to do so with his actions as well. His humility, his piety, his inattention to many of the superficial things in life - these were among his characteristics.
At the end of his relatively long life, Allah the Exalted bestowed martyrdom on him instead of a natural death.
I have repeatedly said that martyrdom is the death of merchants, the kind of death that is highly profitable.
Every soul shall have a taste of death.
Dear God, we are eagerly waiting for this opportunity.
Surely Allah has bought of the believers their lives. [The Holy Quran, 9: 111] God buys the lives of believers. This is a great opportunity which was provided for that great man.
My dear old friend, the late Hajj Agha Baha ed-Din Mohammadi Eraqi, was among the fortunate people in this province who found this opportunity.
He was one of Imam Khomeini's good students and he was a friend of mine in Qom.
May God bestow His mercy and blessings on these two martyrs.
I would also like to commemorate our kind, humble, lovely and friendly scholar, the late Hajj Agha Mojtaba Hajj Akhund, who was one of my old friends in Hojjatiyyeh School in Qom. He was pious, sincere, virtuous and honest.
May God bestow His mercy and blessings on him.
After the Revolution and before my presidential terms, I met him in his home during one of my trips to Kermanshah and I had the opportunity to see his artistic works up close.
Later on, after Imam Khomeini (r.a.) had passed away, he sent me one of his works.
I asked him to write a hadith on a piece of paper so that I could put it up on the wall: "He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others." We must not forget the responsibility to educate ourselves.
He wrote the hadith in his exquisite handwriting and I had it framed and put it up in my room: "He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."
This is the flaw of our work.
Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others.
Those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] According to this holy ayah, which was recited at the beginning of this meeting, fear of God is a characteristic of learned people.
Well, learned people and ulama have many characteristics, but this holy ayah only refers to fear of God.
The characteristic of knowledge is that it strikes fear of God - this great blessing - into the hearts of those who possess it.
Compared with people of my age, it is easier for you dear youth to develop fear of God in your hearts. When you reach my age, things will become difficult for you unless you take care of them during your youth.
The difference is that some people reach old age and some others do not.
You should know that the difference between 20, 30 or 70 years of age is not that great. Time passes like a flash.
When people are twenty years old, they think that they have a long time before they reach the age of seventy.
No, time passes like a flash and soon it will be time to leave this world. If you want to do something with this short life, you should prepare the way while you are young.
I believe fear of God, divine remembrance, piety and closeness to God are more urgent and more advisable for seminarians than acquiring knowledge.
Knowledge that is not accompanied by piety is useless and sometimes harmful.
We had certain learned people - both religious and non-religious scholars - who not only failed to make use of their knowledge to benefit themselves and others, but their knowledge also became a burden and a problem.
This spirituality is like a soul for knowledge and those who possess it.
The city of Kermanshah is an important city.
As was pointed out by Mr. Olama, Kermanshah used to have great learned scholars in the distant past. And over the past 200, 250 years, there were great scholarly families in this city - such as the Al-e Agha family, the Jalili family and other scholarly families in which there were not just one, two or ten learned people: there were more of them.
In this regard, another point about Kermanshah that attracts my attention is that the people of Kermanshah are hospitable and generous to everybody who visits their city and it appears that they are even more hospitable and generous to religious scholars who visit their city.
The late Agha Mohammad Ali - who was the son of the late Vahid Behbahani and one of his best students - decided to come to Kermanshah and stay.
Although he did not have such an intention, Kermanshah convinced him to stay and he started the Al-e Agha family in Kermanshah.
He and many of his children and descendents are considered among the learned religious scholars of Kermanshah.
This is one example.
Another example is the late Aseyyed Hossein Haeri, who had travelled to Mashhad towards the end of his life.
I remember certain things about him.
He was the son of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani's brother, and a student of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani and a great cleric from Iraq who stayed in Kermanshah for many years.
He used to carry out religious rulings in Isfahan.
He was both a religious scholar and a spiritual figure.
In terms of his knowledge, he was a student of the late Fathali Soltanabadi who used to live in Samara at that time.
Another figure that I would like to mention is the late Sardar-e Kaboli, an outstanding scholar in different areas.
The book that has been written about him is a very good book. I read the book several years ago.
He lived in Kermanshah for around sixty years and luminaries benefited a lot from him.
I read in the book that the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi visits Kermanshah on a pilgrimage and meets with the late Sardar-e Kaboli. They debate about Kiblah or a similar issue and the late Sardar-e Kaboli speak about certain scholarly matters.
The writer of the book says that he saw with his own eyes - I thinks he says he saw with his own eyes, but I am not sure because I read the book several years ago - that Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi would sit down with Sardar-e Kaboli to learn those scholarly matters from him while he was a marja taqlid and an outstanding scholar.
And this is a lesson for us: the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi decided to learn something new at the age of eighty while he was a marja taqlid.
For a learned scholar, not only is this not a disgrace or a flaw, but it is a source of honor.
We seminarians should learn from them. You dear youth should move forward on the basis of such principles.
This man was from Kabul and he had been raised in India and lived in Najaf. He decided to come to Kermanshah and the people of Kermanshah received him with open arms.
The late Sardar-e Kaboli - who was an all-around scholar - stayed in Kermanshah for sixty years.
Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani was another religious scholar who had migrated to this city.
This is the characteristic of this city: the people of this city love religious scholars.
When the people of Kermanshah meet somebody and become familiar with him, they become so friendly that he feels he is in his own homeland.
The late Ashrafi Esfahani was from Isfahan, but he felt at home in Kermanshah and he considered himself a citizen of Kermanshah.
What I said was a kind of introduction to my speech.
Now I would like to discuss a few points.
Dear people, honorable scholars, esteemed luminaries and young seminarians, you should know that today the responsibility of the clergy is heavier.
There are two reasons.
Therefore, the responsibility has become heavier.
Today you are in such a situation.
But you must not be afraid. "Fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah."
[The Holy Quran, 33: 39] Do not be afraid of anything. Do not be afraid of the hardships that you will face on your path.
This is not to say that you should pretend your responsibility is easy.
Try to do things that are considered impossible.
After all, this was what happened in Iran.
The achievement that was made in Iran - all analysts of the world would sit down together for hours and days and nights to discuss it and all of them would reach a unanimous conclusion: that it was impossible.
All analysts were saying that this was impossible, but it happened in Iran.
Even some of the revolutionaries were saying that it was impossible.
The late Mr. Taleghani told me, "Imam Khomeini (r.a.) says that the Shah must go, but obviously it is impossible for the Shah to go."
He could not believe that it was possible for the Shah to go.
He told me that Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was saying strange things.
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that the Shah would have to go.
Not only the Shah but also America, the west, the colonial powers and the arrogant powers had to leave.
Nobody could believe this, but it happened.
Nobody could believe that among the Islamic countries, the biggest revolution would happen in Egypt: the Egypt of Camp David Accords, the Egypt of Hosni Mubarak.
There might have been certain people who considered such a revolution possible, but nobody thought it would happen in Egypt.
This is what we must keep in mind.
Go after things that are considered impossible and try to make them happen.
In order to do heavy tasks, tackle them in a determined way. "And fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah."
What are the difficulties? The answer is, "Allah is sufficient to take account."
Allah is sufficient to take account.
This is our path.
In one part of the Holy Quran, we religious scholars are advised to fear God and in another part, we are advised to "deliver the messages of Allah". The messages of Allah are the same messages that were delivered by His prophets.
Allah the Exalted says, "And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the devils from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them), and had your Lord pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge."
[The Holy Quran 6: 112] Divine prophets are surrounded by devils "from among men and jinn". They are attacked by devils from among mankind and jinn.
If we are supposed to promote the messages of God, we should expect being attacked by devils from among mankind and jinn.
They will attack us, so we should prepare ourselves for their attacks.
We must build a spiritual wall against the enemies within ourselves - a wall of piety and reliance on God - so that we do not collapse from within.
Physical retreat and defeat are the result of inner retreat and defeat.
It is the inner self of human beings that imposes a physical defeat on them.
If you are not defeated in your heart, nobody can defeat you.
The wall that must be built in your heart is the wall of piety and reliance on God. "And in Allah should the believers put their trust." [The Holy Quran, 3: 122] "In Allah let the trusting put their trust."
[The Holy Quran, 39: 36] These are lessons for us.
We must recite the Holy Quran in a careful way. We should learn these lessons: they are guidelines for life.
The modern devils who attack you through the internet, satellite channels and highly advanced tools of communication - they have modern things to say.
I have received reports that currently petro-dollars are being spent on certain projects.
On the one hand, they are spending huge amounts of money in order to establish anti-Shia groups among Sunni Muslims in certain Islamic countries.
On the other hand, they pay certain so-called Shia preachers to insult and level allegations against the Mother of the Faithful, Aisha, in the name of Shia Islam.
These are their methods.
Discord among us is the biggest blessing for them.
I would like to take this opportunity to mention a point. Your province is inhabited by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.
Shia and Sunni scholars should arrange meetings with each other and discuss their points of disagreement.
We have certain things in common.
You can have your own beliefs, but at the same time you can also cooperate with each other.
If they want to have a religious discussion, there is no problem.
I have nothing against religious discussions. If they want to have scholarly religious discussions among scholars and experts, they may sit down together and have such discussions.
Either way, it is not a problem. Apart from these disagreements, there are certain things that we have in common.
Shia scholars have influence over Shia Muslims, and Sunni scholars have influence over Sunni Muslims. They should make use of their influence in order to eliminate the common problems.
Today there are certain people who are using takfir as their weapon and they are not afraid of announcing that they are takfiri. These people are like poison.
It is necessary to cleanse Islamic environments of this poison.
Therefore, the heavy responsibility that I spoke about encompasses all these aspects and starts from self-education and developing humility in one's heart.
Another responsibility is acquiring knowledge.
I have heard that certain luminaries of Kermanshah are living in Qom. Definitely, the dear gentlemen who have attended this meeting are familiar with them. These people should be encouraged to return to Kermanshah, or if they cannot come and live in Kermanshah, they should come and stay for a while every year.
Therefore, the issue of knowledge is a very important issue.
Of course, besides acquiring knowledge, there is the issue of promoting Islam, which is very important.
There was a seminarian who used to attend my classes in Mashhad.
He said that he had been busy promoting Islam in a distant town in Khorasan province. I asked, "What happened at the end?" He said, "I came to the conclusion that none of the things I had learned is good for these people and that whatever I had learned is useless to them."
This is a case of failure to identify the appropriate audience.
Today we have many educated youth.
In Kermanshah, the population of educated youth is very large.
There was a time when this was not the case.
Before the Revolution, the population of university graduates in Kermanshah province was around three hundred.
Today the number of university graduates is tens of times larger than that.
These graduates are young and they are exposed to different waves of propaganda and different discourses, which creates questions in their minds.
You should be aware of their questions and prepare answers and then you should arrange meetings with them and answer their questions.
You should chose your audience, become familiar with the way they think and use the Holy Quran, Sunnah and the works of our luminaries to provide them with answers - answers that are appropriate for their ideology and their needs.
As Mr. Mamduhi rightly pointed out, it is necessary to select certain parts of the books written by the late Mr. Motahhari and the holy book "Al-Mizan" and to present them to our youth based on their needs and questions.
This should be done in Qom.
These things are necessary.
You should be concerned about spiritual education at least as much as you are concerned about teaching.
Purify your audience and educate them.
As I said earlier, this education is difficult: "He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."
And it is necessary to fulfill this difficult responsibility.
The clergy have social responsibilities as well. They should get involved in social issues, but the essential point is that their involvement in social issues should be accompanied by spirituality not by a tendency to dominate others, otherwise their involvement will be useless.
The characteristic of the clergy is that they raise the awareness of people and convince them to do certain things through spirituality, ethics, advising and presenting suggestions. Of course, if you become President, you will have other responsibilities.
Prayers are everything.
A person who is completely isolated in terms of his relationships - if such a person preserves his relationship with prayers, he will achieve salvation.
Payers are very important.
Encourage your audience to engage in prayers and prepare the way for them to take part in congregational prayers.
I do not know if the annual conference on prayers has ever been held in Kermanshah or not.
Shia and Sunni preachers should not insult each other.
They should cooperate with one another.
But there are certain things that they have in common and they should cooperate in those areas.
By Allah's favor, the clergy will move forward if this happens.
I would tell you that when the Islamic Revolution achieved victory in Iran, Islam was revitalized in the world.
They started to wonder what driving force managed to give rise to such a great event, an event that shook the west.
The victory of the Islamic Revolution and the greatness of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) shook the west and the arrogant powers.
Many people started searching for the causes, so they referred to the Holy Quran and found out certain truths about Islam.
At that juncture, Islam was faced with a wave of attacks, which continued later on. The second wave started when Marxism collapsed.
Even in Islamic countries, there were many youth and sincere people who had pinned their hopes on Marxism. They thought establishing a socialist government would eradicate poverty, injustice and other such things in their country. Some of them truly believed in Marxism.
I met some of them in person - both Muslims and non-Muslims. They were sincere people, but they did not believe in Islam.
They had become supporters of Marxism because they thought Marxism held some hope for the people.
But later on when Marxism collapsed, they realized that they were wrong and that Marxism was useless.
Therefore, they developed a tendency towards Islam.
All the youth movements that are demanding Islam in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and other places used to shout leftist slogans during the 1960s and 1970s. They used to shout communist slogans 30, 40 years ago. And the statements of those who spoke about Islam were interspersed with Marxist ideas.
Even in our country, there were certain such people, but I do not want to mention names.
There were certain people who used to speak about Islam, but they were in fact promoting Marxist ideas in their Islamic statements.
Such things reveal their effect somewhere. After Marxism collapsed, all these movements that had lost their faith in Marxism turned to Islam.
They turned to Islam, the Holy Quran, divine commands and the Islamic Republic.
They realized that the Islamic Republic was fighting all the oppressive powers that were sucking the blood of the people, and that it was standing firm like a mountain. They were astonished. They thought, "Let us see what this government is."
Do you see what is happening?
They want to sideline this issue in their propaganda, but this will not affect the nature of the issue.
Thousands of people came together in the financial center of America - in the economic capital of America, New York - and they shouted that they did not want capitalism. They came together on Wall Street, which is the heart of capitalism in the world. They are neither immigrants, nor African-Americans, nor members of lower social classes.
We have said from the beginning that we want "neither the east, nor the west" - that is to say, we neither want the capitalist system, nor the socialist system.
You should be prepared.
Muslim clergy should be prepared.
It is necessary to promote the logical, firm and deep-rooted teachings of Islam, which have been extracted from the Holy Quran, Sunnah and the statements of the infallible Imams (a.s.) - firm and reasonable intellectual principles which are in line with the needs of human beings and human societies.
You will see that the tendency towards Islam will grow stronger.
There are many things that I want to discuss with you and as I said, this meeting has been very enjoyable for me, but there is not enough time.
Dear God, let us be among the learned religious scholars who please You.
Dear God, provide our youth and these young seminarians - who are the saplings of the garden of religious knowledge - with the opportunity to become active religious scholars, no matter where they live: in Kermanshah or other places.
Bestow Your grace, mercy and guidance on all of us.
Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with us.

Leader’s Speech on 24th Demise Anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on June 4, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on the occasion of the demise anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem al-Mustafa Muhammad, upon his immaculate, pure, chosen, guided and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
We are thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us another opportunity to commemorate our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) on such a day and express our respect for him.
Although the memory of Imam (r.a.) is alive among our people at all times, the 14th of Khordad is the manifestation of the Iranian nation's love for him.
This year the demise anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) has coincided with the martyrdom anniversary of his great ancestor, Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.).
Also, this occasion has coincided with the 50th anniversary of the determining and important event that took place on the 15th of Khordad in the year 1342.
The 15th of Khordad was an important historical juncture.
I would like to briefly discuss a few points in this regard and then I will discuss the pressing issues that are necessary to discuss.
The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement by the people and the clergy.
Before the 15th of Khordad, important events had taken place in the year 1341 as well as at the beginning of the year 1342.
For example, the event in Feiziyeh School took place on the 2nd of Farvardin in 1342: it resulted in the injury of seminarians and the insult to the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Golpaygani.
Before that event, towards the end of the year 1341, there were demonstrations in Tehran's bazaar and the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khansari, was insulted.
These things show that the movement by the clergy had reached such levels in 1341 and early 1342 that security forces of the oppressive regime had started to treat seminarians, religious scholars and even marja taqlids in a brutal way.
However, the 15th of Khordad of 1342 was a very important juncture.
The reason is that the event which took place on the 15th of Khordad revealed that the bond between the people and the clergy had reached a so-called dangerous level.
In that year, on the anniversary of Ashura - which fell on the 13th of Khordad - our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) delivered a historic speech in Feiziyeh School.
Later on when they had arrested Imam (r.a.), on the 15th of Khordad there was a great movement in Tehran as well as in Qom and other cities and the taghuti regime decided to do everything in its power to suppress the movement by relying on its army, police and security organizations.
The point is that it was this bond that ensured the spread and victory of the movement.
Wherever a movement is supported by the people, that movement will prevail.
But if the people do not develop a bond with a protest movement, that movement will fail.
For example, after the Constitutional Movement in Iran, there were certain events and certain activities by both leftist and nationalist groups, but all of them were destined to fail because they did not have the support of the people.
When the people step into the arena and support a movement with their hearts and minds and with their presence, it becomes possible for that movement to prevail and achieve victory.
The event that took place on the 15th of Khordad proved this point.
The arrest of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) resulted in such an uprising in Tehran and certain other parts of the country that the regime had to step in to suppress the people in a brutal way. A large number of people were killed.
The streets of Tehran were covered with the blood of pious people and youth.
On the 15th of Khordad, the brutal and ruthless nature of the taghuti regime was fully revealed.
Another point regarding the event which happened on the 15th of Khordad - a point to which our youth and dear people should pay attention - is that no international community and none of the so-called human rights organizations protested against the brutal killings in Tehran and other parts of the country.
The people and the clergy remained in the arena.
They said that it was a feudalist movement. The nationalists - who were claiming to support anti-government activities - also condemned the movement.
Wherever lazy people fail to take risks and play a role in the arena, they accuse pious combatants of extremism. They said that the movement was an extremist movement.
They rejected it as a radical movement. Imam (r.a.) remained in the arena, relying on the support of the people, and he managed to present the image of a truly decisive and determined spiritual leader to all people and to all history.
Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) had three beliefs which made him decisive, courageous and steadfast: namely, faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself. These three beliefs revealed themselves in the character, decisions and actions of Imam (r.a.) in the true sense of the word.
Imam (r.a.) spoke to the people through his heart and the people accepted his call with their heart and soul.
They stepped into the arena and resisted in a brave way.
Their movement - which had no sympathizers in the world and received no assistance - gradually moved towards ultimate victory.
I would like to briefly explain the three beliefs of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
The points I will discuss in this regard are important points that can illuminate our path only if they find their way into our hearts.
Regarding faith in God, Imam (r.a.) was the manifestation of this holy ayah: "Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector."
[The Holy Quran, 3: 173] Imam (r.a.) was firmly committed to "Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector" with all his heart and soul.
He acted, worked and spoke for the sake of God and he knew that "if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you" [The Holy Quran, 47: 7] is a divine promise and that it is definite and inviolable.
Regarding faith in the people, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) knew the Iranian nation in the true sense of the word.
Imam (r.a.) believed that our nation enjoys deep religious faith and is intelligent and courageous, a nation that has the capacity to shine like the sun in different areas only if it has competent leaders.
One time an incompetent person like Shah Sultan Hussein caused the Iranian nation to retreat into a corner, but another time a courageous person like Nader Gholi - without those honorary titles - emerged among the people and became their leader by relying on his courage and as a result, our nation managed to expand the arena of its glory from Delhi to the Black Sea.
He had faith in the Iranian nation.
He provoked the people's religious pride and the Iranian nation became the role model of resistance and insight.
In the eyes of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.), the people were the dearest and enemies of the people were the most hated.
The fact that Imam (r.a.) did not stop his battle against the domineering powers even for one single moment, was mainly because the domineering powers were enemies of the people's happiness, and Imam (r.a.) believed that enemies of the people were his enemies too.
As for self-confidence, Imam (r.a.) taught the people of Iran to be confident.
Before instilling a sense of confidence into the people of Iran, Imam (r.a.) first revived this sense of self-confidence in himself. He exhibited his faith in his capabilities in the true sense of the word. On the anniversary of Ashura in the year 1342, while he was alone, Imam (r.a.) threatened the Shah that he would ask the people of Iran to force him out of the country if he continued acting like that.
This threat was made by a cleric in Qom who had no weapons, no equipment, no money and no international support.
He managed to resist in this arena by relying on his faith in God and in himself.
The day when Imam (r.a.) returned from exile, he threatened the government of Bakhtiar at Behesht Zahra Cemetery and he announced in a resonating voice that he would punch Bakhtiar's government in the mouth and that he would establish another government.
Imam (r.a.) had faith in himself and in his capabilities.
It was this self-confidence that was transferred to the people of Iran through his words and actions.
And we had started to believe these things. Instilling a sense of inability - with the purpose of making nations lose faith in their capabilities - is one of the effective ways in which domineering powers spread their domination over different nations.
In this way, they managed to keep the Iranian nation backwards in politics, science and economic activities as well as in all other arenas of life.
He told the Iranian nation, "You can."
He restored our courage. He restored our determination. He restored our self-confidence.
For this reason, the Iranian nation has achieved victory over the past thirty-something in all the areas that I will discuss later on in this meeting.
These three beliefs of Imam (r.a.) - namely faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself - became the axis of all his decisions, actions and policies.
At the beginning of the movement, these three beliefs were a source of energy for Imam (r.a.).
The same is true of the time when he was in exile, the time when he left for Paris and the time when he returned to Iran.
It was these three beliefs that gave Imam (r.a.) the power to enter Tehran in those conditions.
These three beliefs were exhibited in the events that happened during Bahman of 1357, in the fitnas that happened in the country, in the establishment of the Islamic Republic, in his open resistance against the oppressive global order, in the slogan of "neither the East, nor the West", in the imposed war and in all the events that took place in those eventful ten years of Imam's life.
These three beliefs were the basis of Imam's decisions, actions and policies.
Even in the last few days of his life, nobody noticed any signs of despair, doubt, exhaustion, weakness or submission in the words and actions of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
Many revolutionaries throughout the world start to have doubts and become conservative as they grow older.
Sometimes they even take back their main statements.
The statements that were issued by Imam (r.a.) during the last few years of his life were sometimes even more strongly worded and revolutionary than his statements in the year 1342.
He was growing old, but he was young at heart and his soul was vibrant.
This is the same steadfastness that has been described in the Holy Quran: "And that if they should keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water."
[The Holy Quran, 72: 16] In another ayah, Allah the Exalted says: "(As for) those who say: Our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the garden which you were promised." [The Holy Quran, 41: 30] These three beliefs kept Imam (r.a.) young and vibrant.
These things replaced despair and pessimism. The people of Iran changed their characteristics and Allah the Exalted changed their conditions. "Surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition."
[The Holy Quran, 13: 11] The people of Iran reformed their path, their movement and their motives and Allah the Exalted helped and supported them.
What was the result?
There are many lessons that our dear youth should learn from the dependence of the taghuti Pahlavi regime - which is was even worse than the reactionary and disgraced Qajar regime - on England and subsequently on America.
Their dependence had reached a disgraceful level.
After the Revolution, an outstanding American diplomat mentioned the same thing in his writings. He said that it was the Americans who used to tell the Shah what he needed and what he did not need.
It was the Americans who used to tell him with whom to establish relations and with whom not to.
It was the Americans who used to tell him to whom he should sell oil and to whom he should not.
That dependent country transformed into an independent and proud country.
Corrupt, treasonous and materialistic rulers, who were immersed in their carnal desires and human passions, were in charge of our country. They were replaced by representatives of the people.
They were replaced by officials who had been elected by the people.
In the past thirty-something years, the individuals who have assumed power in our country and taken control of our policies and economy, have been representatives of the people.
They did not line their own pockets after assuming power, which is a very important point. Of course, some of them were more pious than others.
Those evil, dependent and greedy politicians who were submissive against the enemies and treated the people in an angry way, were replaced by representatives of the people. Our scientifically backward country transformed into a country that was advanced in terms of science.
Before the Revolution, we had not made any scientific achievements in the country.
Is this an insignificant achievement?
International scientific centers predict that in a few years - by the year 2017 - Iran will rank fourth in the world in terms of science.
Is this an insignificant accomplishment?
Our country, which had made no scientific achievements, has achieved this position. There was a time we had to ask foreigners to send their engineers to our country to build dams, roads and factories for us whenever we needed a road, a highway, a dam or a factory.
Today Iranian youth are building thousands of factories and hundreds of dams, bridges, roads and highways in the country without receiving the slightest help from foreigners.
Would it be appropriate if we ignored these things?
In areas relating to health and medicine, Iranian patients who had the money had to travel to Europe for slightly complicated operations, and those who did not have the money had to die.
Today the most complicated operations - liver transplants, lung transplants and important things in other medical areas - are being carried out in our country, not just in Tehran but in many distant cities across the country.
The Iranian nation does not need foreigners in this area.
Our nation has achieved independence and self-sufficiency in this vital area.
Many parts of this country had been ignored.
Before the Revolution, I used to travel to different places across the country.
However, different services are being offered in different parts of the country, including remote towns and villages.
Today nobody can say that a particular area does not have electricity or roads and other such things.
Today the opposite is surprising. At that time, our population was 35 million and there were 150,000 university students in the country.
Today our population has increased a hundred percent, but the number of our university students has increased by 20, even 30 times.
The number of students, professors and universities in the country is remarkable.
In every remote town, there are one, two, five and sometimes ten universities.
At that time, there were certain provinces in which the number of high schools was less than ten.
Today in every city of the same provinces, there are several universities.
This is a great movement by the people of Iran which is the result of the Revolution and selfless efforts of Iranian youth and government officials over the past thirty-something years.
These are important developments.
Thanks to the Revolution, many infrastructure-related projects were carried out in the country. Thousands of factories were built. Many mother companies were built.
The products which we had to beg for and buy in small amounts from foreigners are being mass produced in the country today.
It is necessary to see these things.
All of these things are the blessings of the three beliefs that Imam (r.a.) instilled into our nation: faith in God, faith in the people and faith in oneself.
I am not saying these things in order to create a false sense of pride and happiness.
No, there is still a long way to go.
I would say that if we compare our conditions with the era of taghut, these achievements will look remarkable, but we will realize that we have a long way to go if we compare our conditions with the conditions of an ideal Islamic Iran - namely, a country which Islam wants us to have, a society that Islam wants us to have, a society in which there is worldly pride and welfare as well as religious faith, ethics and spirituality, all in abundance.
I am saying these things so that our dear youth and our courageous nation realize that they can continue this path by relying on the three beliefs that I spoke about.
You should know that there is a long way to go, but you have the capability.
You can continue traversing this long path at a high speed until you reach the peaks in a powerful way.
I am saying these things so that you realize that the enemies who want to create despair in our hearts are acting out of spite.
The roadmap lies in front of our eyes.
We have a roadmap.
What is this roadmap?
Imam's principles are clear principles. Fortunately, his statements and writings have been made available to our people in the form of twenty-something volumes [of Imam Khomeini's speeches] and the main points have been presented in his testament.
I believe it is not advisable to keep mentioning the name of Imam (r.a.) but let his principles sink into oblivion. This is wrong.
Imam (r.a.) gave this roadmap to us.
As far as foreign policy is concerned, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we put up a resistance against interventionist and domineering policies, that we establish brotherly relations with other Muslim nations, that we develop relations with all countries except the ones that have drawn their swords against the Iranian nation and are being hostile, that we fight Zionism, that we resist in order to liberate Palestine, that we help oppressed people throughout the world and that we put up a resistance against oppressors.
Imam's testament is available to us.
His writings and statements have been recorded and are available in the form of books. Regarding culture, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require rejection of the permissive Western culture, rejection of rigidity and reactionary attitudes, rejection of hypocrisy in religion, decisive defense of ethics and Islamic commands, and fighting the spread of immorality and corruption in society.
As for economic matters, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require relying on the national economy, relying on self-sufficiency, ensuring economic justice in production and distribution, defending underprivileged people and confronting the capitalist culture coupled with respect for ownership rights. Imam (r.a.) rejected the oppressive capitalist culture, but he also stressed the need for respecting ownership and property rights, capital and labor.
Also, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we resist melting into the global economy and that we preserve independence of our national economy.
The Iranian nation can bridge the gap between current conditions and those ideal conditions by following this roadmap, by relying on their firm religious faith, by remembering their Imam (r.a.).
The Iranian nation can move forward.
Considering its capabilities and talent and the outstanding individuals who are thankfully present among our people, the Iranian nation can continue the revolutionary path that we have been following over the past thirty-something years with more power and firmer determination. By Allah's favor, our nation will be able to become a genuine role model for other Muslim nations.
Now let me speak about the elections, which is a sensitive and current issue these days.
Dear brothers and sisters and dear people of Iran, elections are the manifestation of all the three beliefs of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and we should have faith in the same things.
Elections are the manifestation of faith in God, because taking part in elections is a religious obligation.
It is our responsibility to play a role in the destiny of our country.
Everybody in our country has this responsibility.
Elections are the manifestation of faith in the people, because the will of the people manifests itself in the form of elections: it is the people who choose government officials through elections.
Elections are the manifestation of having faith in oneself, because anybody who casts his vote into the ballot box feels that he is playing a role in the destiny of the country and that his role is determining in its own right.
This is a very important point.
Therefore, elections are the manifestation of faith in God, faith in the people and faith in oneself.
Every vote that you cast into the ballot box for any of the eight honorable candidates is a vote for the Islamic Republic.
A vote for any of the candidates is a vote for the Islamic Republic: it is a vote of confidence for the [political] system and its electoral mechanism.
When you enter the arena of elections - either as a voter or as a candidate - your mere presence in this arena means that you have confidence in the Islamic Republic and in our electoral mechanism.
On a less important level, your presence results in a vote for the person whom you consider as more valuable for the future of the country than the other candidates.
Our helpless foreign enemies are thinking of a way to turn this election into a threat against the Islamic Republic. This is while an election is a great opportunity for the Islamic Republic.
They are hoping for a cold and lifeless election so that they can say the people are not interested in the Islamic Republic or they can create a fitna after the election, just as they did in the year 1388 after that enthusiastic election.
These are what the enemies of our nation are after.
They do not know our people. The enemies of our nation have forgotten the 9th of Dey. Those who think that in our country there is a silent majority who are opposed to the Islamic Republic, have forgotten that over the past thirty-four years massive numbers of people have taken to the streets every year on the 22nd of Bahman in different cities of our country in order to support the Islamic Republic and shout "death to America".
In order to make our elections lifeless, their think tanks constantly produce ideas and feed them to their media and their spokesmen.
One day they say our elections have been engineered, another day they say our elections are not free, yet another day they say our elections are not legitimate in the eyes of the people.
They do not know our people, neither do they know our elections and the Islamic Republic.
Does it exist in capitalist countries?
In capitalist countries, if candidates are members of the existing two or three parties and enjoy the support of capitalists, company owners, wealthy people and mafias of wealth and power, they can campaign and if not, they cannot even campaign.
There were certain individuals who did not enjoy the support of the Zionists and blood-thirsty international capitalist networks, and they could not enter the arena of election no matter how hard they tried.
They neither had access to a media outlet, nor were any TV channels available to them.
For every second of campaigning, they had to spend huge amounts of money.
In our country, candidates are given equal opportunities to speak to the people for many hours through state media without having to spend one single rial.
In which part of the world do such things exist?
The only thing that controls entry into our elections is the law.
According to the law, some people can run in our elections and some others cannot.
The law has specified what the conditions are, what the qualifications are and who are in charge of vetting.
All of these things are being done on the basis of the law.
Our foreign enemies close their eyes to these realities and say certain things, and as I have pointed out before, sadly there are impious people who repeat the same things.
But by Allah's favor and with their presence, resistance and firm determination, our people will respond to all these machinations and their response will be crushing and decisive.
Now I would like to give a piece of advice to the honorable candidates. The honorable candidates speak critically in the televised programs. This is their right.
However, they should pay attention to the point that criticism should signify a determination to move towards a future that is full of hard work and glory.
They should pay attention to this point. I do not favor anybody. From this moment onwards, foreign media will say with ulterior motives that I favor a particular candidate.
I advise the brothers who want to win the people's trust that their comments should be fair.
They can make criticisms, but in doing so, they should not paint a bleak picture and deny the outstanding achievements that have been accomplished under the incumbent administration or previous administrations thanks to the constant efforts of individuals like themselves.
Criticism does not mean denying positive aspects.
The next president will not have to start from zero: thousands of outstanding things have already been done.
Over the course of many years, thousands of fundamental infrastructure-related projects have been carried out in the country under different administrations.
They should not disregard these things.
We cannot afford to deny all this work under the pretext that we have economic problems, that we have the problem of rising prices and inflation. After all, this is not the right thing to do.
However, this does not mean that we should deny everything that has been done in order to present a solution to the existing problems.
Also, the candidates should not make impossible promises.
You should speak in a way that if your recorded statements are replayed to you next year in Khordad, you do not feel ashamed.
Make such promises that you would not have to blame other people under the pretext that they did not let you do what you wanted to do.
Only make promises that you will be able to fulfill.
In our country and according to our Constitution, the president has extraordinary powers.
The Constitution has given vast powers to the president.
He has control over all executive pillars of the country. He has control over the implementation of the laws and regulations in the country. He has the power to utilize the capacities of all experts throughout the country.
The president has room for maneuver in the case of different issues.
The only thing that restricts the president in our country is the law.
His actions can only be restricted by the law, which is not in fact a restriction.
The law provides guidance: it does not restrict.
Those who address the people today and say different things, should discuss what they are capable of doing and what the people need.
They should promise that they will act in a wise and prudent way.
They should promise that they will make use of all the capacities of the Constitution in order to carry out their great responsibility.
They should promise that they will not prefer the interests of foreigners over the interests of the Iranian nation under different pretexts.
Some people argue that we should make concessions to the enemies in order to appease them and in this way they effectively prefer the interests of the enemies over the interests of the Iranian nation. This is wrong. They are angry because you exist, because the Islamic Republic exists, because Imam (r.a.) is alive in the minds of the people and in our national plans, because the people show their feelings for Imam (r.a.) every year on his demise anniversary.
These are the causes of their anger.
If our nation becomes powerful and capable, if it reduces its needs, if it eliminates its problems, if it manages to improve the economy which is our main issue today, the enemy will be defenseless against the Iranian nation.
In any case, what is important is to have determination, faith in God, faith in the people and faith in ourselves, and this applies to both the presidential candidates and the people.
My dear brothers, my dear ones, there will a great test in ten days, and by Allah's favor we hope that in this great test Allah the Exalted will cause an auspicious instance of valor with brilliant outcomes for our nation.
There is no power except with the permission of Great Almighty Allah.
To the Youth in Europe and North America - Khamenei.ir
In the name of God, the Beneficent the Merciful
To the Youth in Europe and North America,
The recent events in France and similar ones in some other Western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them.
I am addressing you, [the youth], not because I overlook your parents, rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts.
I don't address your politicians and statesmen either in this writing because I believe that they have consciously separated the route of politics from the path of righteousness and truth.
I would like to talk to you about Islam, particularly the image that is presented to you as Islam.
Many attempts have been made over the past two decades, almost since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy.
The provocation of a feeling of horror and hatred and its utilization has unfortunately a long record in the political history of the West.
Here, I don't want to deal with the different phobias with which the Western nations have thus far been indoctrinated.
A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments' insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies.
The histories of the United States and Europe are ashamed of slavery, embarrassed by the colonial period and chagrined at the oppression of people of color and non-Christians.
Your researchers and historians are deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars.
This approach is admirable. By mentioning a fraction of this long list, I don't want to reproach history; rather I would like you to ask your intellectuals as to why the public conscience in the West awakens and comes to its senses after a delay of several decades or centuries.
Why should the revision of collective conscience apply to the distant past and not to the current problems?
Why is it that attempts are made to prevent public awareness regarding an important issue such as the treatment of Islamic culture and thought?
You know well that humiliation and spreading hatred and illusionary fear of the â€œotherâ€ have been the common base of all those oppressive profiteers.
Now, I would like you to ask yourself why the old policy of spreading â€œphobiaâ€ and hatred has targeted Islam and Muslims with an unprecedented intensity.
Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?
What concepts and values in Islam disturb the programs of the super powers and what interests are safeguarded in the shadow of distorting the image of Islam?
Hence, my first request is: Study and research the incentives behind this widespread tarnishing of the image of Islam.
My second request is that in reaction to the flood of prejudgments and disinformation campaigns, try to gain a direct and firsthand knowledge of this religion.
The right logic requires that you understand the nature and essence of what they are frightening you about and want you to keep away from. I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam. What I want to say is: Don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices.
Don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam.
Receive knowledge of Islam from its primary and original sources.
Gain information about Islam through the Qur'an and the life of its great Prophet.
I would like to ask you whether you have directly read the Qur'an of the Muslims.
Have you studied the teachings of the Prophet of Islam and his humane, ethical doctrines?
Have you ever received the message of Islam from any sources other than the media?
Have you ever asked yourself how and on the basis of which values has Islam established the greatest scientific and intellectual civilization of the world and raised the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals throughout several centuries?
I would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image-buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality, taking away the possibility of an impartial judgment from you.
Today, the communication media have removed the geographical borders. Hence, don't allow them to besiege you within fabricated and mental borders.
Although no one can individually fill the created gaps, each one of you can construct a bridge of thought and fairness over the gaps to illuminate yourself and your surrounding environment.
While this preplanned challenge between Islam and you, the youth, is undesirable, it can raise new questions in your curious and inquiring minds.
Attempts to find answers to these questions will provide you with an appropriate opportunity to discover new truths.
Therefore, don't miss the opportunity to gain proper, correct and unbiased understanding of Islam so that hopefully, due to your sense of responsibility toward the truth, future generations would write the history of this current interaction between Islam and the West with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment.

Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Shrine - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 20, 2012 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to a group of pilgrims at Imam Ridha's (a.s.) shrine in the holy city of Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate, pure and chosen household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted from the bottom of my heart who gave me another opportunity to meet you dear people and youth - including the honorable people of Mashhad and the surrounding areas as well as the esteemed pilgrims who have travelled from other cities - at the spiritual shrine of Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha (a.s.) and to enjoy the spiritual blessings of sitting in the shade of Imam Ridha (a.s.) and his holy shrine.
I extend my congratulations on Norouz and the arrival of the new year and I hope that for all the people of Iran, this new year will be full of happiness, blessings, joy, dynamism, activity and success in acquiring religious knowledge and achieving piety.
I would like to discuss a few issues with you dear brothers and sisters in this meeting.
The first part of my speech is a brief look at the events that happened in our country in the year 1390 and at the regional and global developments that were related to us.
The reason why I want to discuss the developments of the year 1390 - and particularly the achievements that were made by the Iranian nation last year - is that our enemies and ill-wishers are making threats against our dear nation.
The leaders of the arrogant powers, those who have power and wealth and their followers in our region are doing everything in their power - their financial, propaganda and political power - to intimidate the Iranian people and to disappoint them.
Anybody who has followed the political propaganda of the ill-wishers of the Iranian nation realizes that all the activities, all the economic and political efforts and all the security and military threats are aimed at stopping, disappointing and intimidating the vibrant, living, dynamic, determined and capable Iranian nation, a nation that is standing firm in the middle of the arena in a totally courageous way, a nation that is moving forward.
In fact, aside from the slogan of "we can" which our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) taught us, the Revolution also gave us the courage to say, "We can". They want to convince us that we are incapable.
They are doing everything in their power to achieve this goal and their activities reached full swing in the year 1390.
I would like to stress that despite their will and much to their disappointment, in the year 1390 the Iranian nation once again convinced the enemies and the entire world - with its activities, advances and decisions - that it is capable.
The reason why we stress our strengths is to prove that the Iranian nation made use of its capabilities. The Iranian nation proved that it is capable in spite of the will of the ill-wishers who wanted to prove that the Iranian nation was incapable.
We are aware of our weak points. We have our own weak points, but in general, our strengths are far more than our weak points.
The year 1390 was named "The Year of Economic Jihad".
What is noteworthy is the economic movement of our government officials which was accompanied by the exemplary and praiseworthy cooperation of the people throughout the year 1390.
Among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is the issue of redistributing state subsidies.
All economic experts - both the ones who served in the previous governments and those who serving in the current government - unanimously agree that redistributing state subsidies is a necessity for the country.
In spite of the fact that everybody agreed on the necessity of taking action, nobody had done anything due to the complexities and hardships involved. In the year 1390, the executive and legislative branches of government made efforts and carried out important stages of this work while we were under sanctions and while the hardships and complexities were more than ever before.
The work is not finished yet, but what has been done so far by our government officials both in the executive branch and in the Majlis - which have been mostly successful due to the support and cooperation of the people - are very important and remarkable.
All our honorable people are familiar with the objectives, but it is necessary to reflect on them. The work that has been done is great.
One of the objectives of this law is fair distribution of the state subsidies.
I explained in a speech that state subsidies have always been distributed among the people in an unfair way: this is the nature of general subsidies.
I have received reliable reports from across the country that targeted subsidies have played a significant role in improving living standards of the lower social classes.
This is one of the goals, which is also the most important objective of the subsidy law.
Another goal is to reform the structure of production and the structure of our economy.
Economic experts unanimously agree that targeted subsidies can resolve this problem. They agree that wasteful and low-yield production can be remedied and a balance can be created between input and output.
Another goal is to manage energy consumption.
Because we have been an oil-rich country, we have been in the habit of using gas, natural gas, diesel and kerosene in a wasteful way.
Our consumption has been more wasteful than many countries - and in a sense, more wasteful than all countries in the world.
Reliable statistics have been published which show that if the subsidy law had not been implemented, we would be consuming gas almost twice the amount we currently do.
When we do not produce sufficient gasoline to meet our domestic needs, what do we have to do?
We would have to import it.
Today our domestic consumption of gasoline is approximately as much as our production. We do not need to import gasoline, which is a great advantage for the country.
This was done in the year 1390, exactly when our enemies increased their sanctions on us in order to bring our nation to its knees.
But our youth made efforts and foiled the plots of the enemy with their actions.
Another important economic measure which was taken with the help of our people was in the arena of science and technology.
Science and technology is one of the pillars of a nation's economic power.
A nation that enjoys advanced knowledge and technology will achieve wealth, political independence, honor and power.
I am sensitive to the issue of scientific and technological progress because of the key role it plays.
I receive different reports from different channels on a regular basis and I can say with certainty that the level of our country's advances is much higher than what has been reported.
According to the reports prepared by reliable scientific centers of world - and not our own scientific centers - the fastest scientific growth is taking place in Iran.
Reliable scientific centers of the world reported that in the year 2011 - which ended three months before the year 1390 - the scientific growth of the Iranian nation was 20 percent more than the year 2010. What is the meaning of this?
The Iranian nation acted like that in a situation in which the enemies of the Iranian nation were betting on our collapse and were describing their sanctions as crippling.
Reliable scientific centers of the world also report that Iran is the top country in the region in terms of its scientific level and that it ranks 17th in the world.
These reports are prepared by those who would not refuse to present false reports against us if they could, yet they acknowledge our growth like this. In the year 1390 we made progress in biotechnology. We made progress in nanotechnology.
In the year 1389 the Americans and others proposed certain preconditions for this 20-percent uranium.
We had to prepare it for our research reactor in Tehran, which has been built to produce radiopharmaceuticals: we had run out of 20-percent enriched uranium.
They proposed certain preconditions for providing this uranium. They said that we had to ship our uranium abroad to be enriched to 20-percent.
The Americans used the Brazilian and Turkish governments as intermediaries in order to reach an agreement with us.
After the agreement was signed, the Americans broke their promise: the agreement was not the kind of agreement they wanted. They wanted to win many concessions. They wanted to bully and blackmail us.
Because the Americans broke their promise, the Brazilian and Turkish governments were embarrassed in front of us. This is the story of the 20-percent uranium.
In the year 1390, they produced 20-percent enriched uranium for the research reactor in Tehran and they announced their achievement to the world. Our enemies were astonished.
Although they knew the nuclear reactor in Tehran only produces radiopharmaceuticals, they refused to provide the 20-percent uranium we needed. The reactor in Tehran fulfills the needs of our hospitals and laboratories across the country and thousands of patients need these radiopharmaceuticals, yet they proposed preconditions to blackmail us.
Our youth produced the uranium we needed.
The work was complicated and difficult, but our youth managed to do it. Currently various kinds of radiopharmaceuticals are being produced at the research center in Tehran with domestically produced uranium.
This was done in the year 1390.
In the year 1390 fuel plates were produced domestically in the nuclear industry.
This was done in the year 1390.
The sixfold increase in recombinant drugs and the increase in the export of knowledge-based products and services - these achievements were made in the year 1390.
These are part of achievements which were made in "The Year of Economic Jihad".
These are technological advances.
Last week at the end of the year 1390, I visited the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry.
There were certain things in the institute which can be witnessed when touring different other research centers of the country as well: they convince one that these advances are the rule, not the exception. These important advances - which our people would not even dream about - have been made already and they have become the rule.
First of all, jihad-like spirit and thought were predominant in the institute.
The scientists were working with a jihad-like spirit. They were working as if they were involved in jihad, as if they were fighting in the battlefield in the way of God.
There is a big difference between those who work for the sake of money, social position, fame or knowledge and those who work for the sake of jihad in the way of God.
This is very valuable.
The second characteristic is that our scientists consider the sanctions that are imposed on our nation as opportunities.
During the visit to the institute, which lasted a long time, a few people told me, "Thank God they imposed sanctions on us.
The feeling that the sanctions imposed by the enemies provide us with an opportunity is very valuable.
The third characteristic that I noticed among the employees of the institute was their great self-confidence.
Certain parts of the oil industry have been monopolized by three, four countries in the world: they do not allow other countries to access their technologies.
Over these years, our country has always asked them to do such important and complex things for us and we have paid for their services.
I realized that they were determined and they were saying, "We can. We will do this on our own.
This self-confidence is very valuable for a nation, for the scientists of a nation, for the youth of a nation.
Another characteristic is the tendency to employ young people.
The work is being done by the youth.
The youth are a source of innovation and creativity.
Another characteristic is the relationship between industry and university, which has always been among my wishes.
I used to advise the officials in charge of the relevant sectors in the previous governments that they should try to establish a relationship between industry and university.
Fortunately I saw at the institute that the relationship has been established.
Of course, the relationship should be prevalent and all our industries should be linked to our universities. Then both our knowledge and our industries will grow.
This was the situation of the economic sector in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation were constantly trying to intimidate us. Sometimes they made threats. Other times they mounted political pressure on us.
The agents of the US government are making efforts throughout the world to implement the sanctions, hoping that they will harm the Iranian nation and create a rift between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic.
In the year 1390 we made other great achievements as well, including the active diplomacy that we employed in case of the regional issues.
The Conference on Islamic Awakening, the Conference on Palestinian Intifada, the Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, the World Without Terrorism Conference and the Islamic Awakening and Youth Conference were among the activities which were carried out in Tehran.
The Islamic Republic became the center of attention in the world of Islam which has awakened today.
In the area of economic services, tens of thousands of houses were built in the country and were made available to the people.
These statistics are great. They are important statistics. Houses were built in rural areas.
These are the preliminary stages of "The Decade of Progress and Justice".
One great example of the praiseworthy movements which were carried out by the Iranian nation in the year 1390 was the parliamentary election that was held on the 12th of Esfand.
Of course, I would stress that the election is not over yet. Our people should show the same magnificence in the second round as well.
The election was extremely important.
As I have pointed out before, the enemies did everything in their power for around six months in order to discourage the people from taking part in the election.
Sometimes they said the election would be rigged. Other times they said if the people did not take part in the election, the enemies would become less hostile, and they broadcast various kinds of propaganda in order to drive the people away from the polling stations and ballot boxes.
Yet other times they tried to intimidate, discourage and disappoint our people by assassinating our scientists. They carried out three assassinations in less than six months.
Over the past ten years, the rate of voter turnout in the congressional elections - the Senate and the House of Representatives - has never reached forty percent.
If you compare this with the turnout rate of the Iranian people and their dynamism and presence, then the significance of the matter will be revealed.
Through those pressures, through that psychological warfare, through those threats, through those assassinations, they wanted to make the 12th of Esfand a day of disappointment for the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic, but despite their will and much to their disappointment, the 12th of Esfand became a day of honor and glory for the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran.
The parliamentary election acted as an honest and powerful media outlet.
They report events that have not happened in Iran and they do not report the events that have happened, but they cannot deny the election.
It happened in front of everybody's eyes.
The election presented an accurate picture of the Iranian nation to the world like a great and powerful media outlet.
These were the events that took place in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies made so many investments in order to harm the people of Iran and the Islamic Republic.
These things are only part of the achievements made in the year 1390.
Since the time the nuclear issue was brought up, the pretext for their enmities has been the nuclear issue.
Of course, they know and they acknowledge that Iran is not after nuclear weapons, which is true.
We have not manufactured any nuclear weapons and we never will. They know this and the nuclear issue is just a pretext. One day their pretext is the nuclear issue, another day their pretext is human rights and yet another day their pretext is other domestic issues of our country, but they are all pretexts.
What is the real problem?
The real problem is that the Islamic Republic is safeguarding the great oil and gas resources of the country in a powerful way.
As has always been the case, economic and political power - and the resultant scientific and military power - depend on energy sources, on oil.
The world will need oil and gas for decades and this is an undeniable truth.
The arrogant powers know that their survival depends on oil and gas.
The day they fail to acquire oil at a cheap price, the day they are forced to make concessions and stop bullying for the sake of oil and gas - that day will be a tragic day for them. On the other hand, western countries have faced problems in terms of oil resources and their problems will increase on a daily basis.
Some of the European countries - and western countries in general - will run out of oil in four years. Some others will run out of oil in six years. Yet other western countries will run out of oil in nine years.
According to the calculations of our experts, which are based on the statistics presented by the Americans themselves, the US currently has oil reserves of thirty-something billion barrels and it will run out of oil by 2021.
Currently more than fifty percent of the world's oil flows out of the Persian Gulf and in the future the global flow of oil will depend on three oil-rich countries in the Persian Gulf region.
Of course, Iran is one of the three oil-rich countries and I will explain this point later.
Among all the countries of the world and not just the Persian Gulf region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the greatest sources of oil and gas.
Some countries have more natural gas than we do and some others have more oil than us.
In terms of our oil reserves, we are the fourth country in the world. There are three countries in the world which have more oil than we do. However, in terms of total amount of oil and gas reserves, the Islamic Republic, your dear homeland, has more proven oil reserves than any other country in the world.
This is very interesting for the consumers of oil in the world and for the arrogant powers whose survival depends on energy sources, on oil and gas.
This is the wealth that Iran enjoys. They will run out of oil in four, ten, fifteen years, but considering the proven oil reserves, the Islamic Republic will have oil and gas for another eighty years.
A country that ranks first in terms of its oil and gas reserves is very interesting. What do the arrogant powers want?
They want our country to be ruled by a government whom they can easily control, just like certain countries in the region which have a lot of oil, yet they are like putty in the hands of the Americans. The Americans order them to produce certain amounts of oil and they say, "Yes, sir." The Americans order them to sell their oil at a particular price and they say, "Yes, sir."
In our oil-rich country, which has the largest proven oil and gas reserves in the world, they will oppose any government that safeguards this national wealth in a proud way, does not allow other countries to plunder this wealth and does not follow the policies of the enemies.
Those who think that if we had backed down in the case of the nuclear issue, America would no longer be hostile - they are unaware of this truth.
Their problem is not the nuclear issue.
There are certain countries in our region that have nuclear weapons, but they do not care at all.
The problem is the issue of nuclear weapons or nuclear industry. The problem is not the issue of human rights.
The problem is the Islamic Republic which is standing firm against them like a lion.
If the Islamic Republic had agreed to betray its own people like certain regional regimes, if the Islamic Republic had surrendered to them, they would not be bothering it.
The problem is their arrogant greed and this is the reason behind their enmity towards the Iranian nation.
Of course, the Americans are making a mistake.
It is a big and fatal mistake to think that they can force the Islamic Republic to retreat or back down through hostility, enmity and threats, and they will be punished for this mistake.
Western countries do not allow their people to learn about the future oil tragedy.
They do not want their people to realize what is awaiting them in the case of oil and energy sources. They do not want to tell this to their people.
They think that they can move things forward by being hostile to the Iranian people, but they will not succeed.
Dear brothers and sisters, dear people of Iran, you should know that today the situation of America is precarious in spite of all its muscle-flexing, in spite of all the uproar it causes.
I do not want to use confidential reports or superficial things as evidence: what I am saying is simple mathematics.
Notice that the American President came to power with the slogan of change.
What does change mean?
It means that the existing situation is very bad and that we are determined to change it.
He stepped in with this slogan and the people of America voted for him because of his slogan of change, otherwise racist people were not prepared to vote for a person from an African-American background. But they did, hoping that there would be change.
The fact that the slogan of change affected the people like that shows that the situation was very bad. That is to say, on the admission of the American people, the situation of America was very bad when he decided to run for president.
Therefore, it is an undeniable truth that the situation of America was very bad.
This is not what we say: it was the American people themselves who admitted that their situation was bad.
Then he came to power, but did he bring about change?
Did he manage to change the situation?
This debt is equal to - or bigger than - their gross domestic product.
This is a big problem for a country.
As for their political situation, they were forced to leave Iraq without any achievements and in Afghanistan their situation is becoming worse on a daily basis.
In Muslim countries, in Egypt, in North Africa, in Tunisia, the Americans have completely lost their original awe.
Besides all these things, the Occupy Wall Street movement has started in the cities of America.
Is this situation good?
Therefore, America is in a dire situation.
America might pose threats to other countries. It might do crazy things.
And I would like to take this opportunity to say that we do not have atomic weapons and that we will not build such weapons, but in case the enemies attack us - be it America or the Zionist regime - we will attack them on the same level that they attack us in order to defend ourselves.
The Holy Quran has promised us, "And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn (their) backs, then they would not find any protector or a helper.
Such has been the law of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah's law."
[The Holy Quran, 48: 22-23] Nowhere in the Holy Quran is it said that if you start a war, you will definitely win it. You might win or lose the war you start, just as the Muslims did not always win the wars they started during the early years after the introduction of Islam: they were defeated in certain cases.
But it has been promised that if the enemy attacks, he will definitely be defeated.
You should not say that this is only true of the early years after the introduction of Islam. No, "Such has been the law of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah's law."
This is a divine law. The Iranian people are determined and dynamic and they are not thinking of attacking other countries, but they are firmly attached to their identity, to their wealth, to their religion, to their Islamic Republic.
That is to say, when you consume domestically produced products, you help Iranian laborers, you create job opportunities, you contribute to Iranian investment, you give rise to growth and development.
Consuming foreign products is a wrong cultural norm, which has unfortunately become prevalent in certain portions of our society. Consuming foreign products will harm us. It will stand in the way of our progress.
The government is also responsible: it must support and strengthen national production.
The Majlis should cooperate and the executive branch should make efforts in this regard so that they can boost national production.
And the people should also cooperate: both those who have capital and those who have the power to work.
You dear people should develop a tendency towards Iranian products.
It is wrong to prefer foreign brands - in the case of clothes, utensils, furniture, foodstuffs and other things - to domestic brands while in many cases our domestic products might be far better than their foreign equivalents.
I have heard that the clothes which are produced in certain cities across the country are taken abroad and foreign brand names are attached to them, and then they are shipped into the country to be sold as foreign products.
If these clothes do not go through this process, Iranian customers might not like to pay for them, but simply because the clothes bear French brand names, Iranian customers buy them. This is wrong.
Domestic production is important.
This is part of the effort to reform the norms of consumption, which I discussed with our people in this place two years ago. It is also part of economic jihad, which I discussed last year. National production is important and it must be the goal.
Dear people, dear brothers and sisters, today we need unity and solidarity across the country.
There are many pretexts for discord.
In the case of certain issues not even two people have the same opinion. This must not become a pretext for discord.
Sometimes a person might have a certain tendency that might not be shared by other people, but this must not become a source of discord.
The Holy Quran teaches us, "And do not quarrel for then you will be weak in hearts and your power will depart." [The Holy Quran, 8: 46] If we quarrel about different issues - political issues, economic issues, personal issues - if we fight with each other, our enemy will be encouraged.
Some of the courage that our enemy has found in the past years is due to our quarrels.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) teaches us a lesson.
Opponents are of two kinds. One kind of opponent wants the truth, the Islamic Republic, the Revolution, Islam and God, but he might choose the wrong path.
Such opponents are different from those who work against the Islamic system and pursue hostile objectives.
Make hearts tender towards each other and treat each other with more kindness. Unfortunately these electronic and internet media outlets have prepared the ground for widespread slander.
However, the most important factor is that we should feel committed to observing the Islamic rules of conduct. We should feel committed to observing the law.
My statement must not be used as a pretext to criticize and persecute our revolutionary youth as extremists.
No, I consider all our proud youth and all our faithful and revolutionary youth as my own children and I support them. I support our revolutionary, faithful and proud youth, but I also advise everybody to observe the Islamic rules of conduct and the law in their behavior.
Everybody must observe the law.
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic embodies the values of the Revolution.
The same is true of our government officials.
The executive branch must not undermine the authority of the Majlis. Similarly the Majlis must not undermine the authority of the executive branch and the President.
They must work together and cooperate. This does not mean that everybody should think in the same way.
I hope the year 1391, which starts from today, will be full of dynamism, activity, success and happiness for the people of Iran.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, make our dear youth and people steadfast on the straight path.
Dear God, suppress and defeat the enemies of this nation.
Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) satisfied and happy with us and help us benefit from his prayers.
Shrine - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of Islamic Revolution to a large gathering of pilgrims at Imam Ridha's (a.s.) shrine in the holy city of Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet and the love of our hearts, Ab-al-Qassem al-Mustafa Muhammad, upon his immaculate, pure, chosen and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Greetings be upon Seddiqah at-Tahirah Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah.
I extend my greetings and congratulations to all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this warm and enthusiastic meeting, and from the depth of my heart I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me one more opportunity to be present at the holy shrine of Hazrat Abul-Hassan ar-Ridha (many greetings be upon him) on another Norouz and meet with you dear people of Mashhad and the esteemed pilgrims who have come here from different parts of the country.
I ask Allah the Exalted to guide our hearts and tongues to accommodate and say whatever that satisfies Him.
And this is a great blessing that every year on Norouz I find the opportunity to see the joys and beauties that are inherent to Norouz and at the same time evaluate current issues and conditions of the country among you people, take a look at our past and future and have brief evaluation of our large-scale national conditions. It is necessary for us to evaluate ourselves in the case of our personal matters.
We should review everything that has happened to us and try to learn lessons for the future. The dear brothers and sisters should pay attention to the fact that we people of Iran are not the only ones who try to study, track and evaluate our issues.
There are certain nations that are making use of our experiences. There are also certain other nations that are studying the conditions of the Iranian nation: they become happy whenever we make advances and achievements.
If we achieve a victory, they feel victorious and if we fail, they feel that they have failed as well.
There are other people in the world who carefully study everything that we do: these people become happy whenever we make mistakes and they feel disappointed whenever we succeed.
They are the ill-wishers of the Iranian nation.
They too are carefully studying whatever we do. The majority of them are the same people who used to have full control over every affair of our country for many years.
The Revolution came and put an end to their domination.
For this reason, they are opposed to the Revolution. They are opposed to revolutionary people.
Therefore, we are being watched carefully by a large number of people in the world.
Therefore, we should be realistic in our evaluation of our performance in the past and the plans we have for the future.
Some people in our country only see the weaknesses whenever they look at the conditions of the country.
They only see the high prices. They only see the decrease in production in certain sectors.
I have a different outlook.
When I look at the conditions of our country and our nation, I see a vast arena that is full of challenges, and the Iranian nation has been proud and victorious in this arena despite the will of the enemies.
There are certain weaknesses and problems. There have been certain bitter events among the things that have happened in our country. Certain materialistic powers did everything in their power to cripple the Iranian nation.
And they announced this. The incompetent lady who was responsible for America's foreign policy boldly announced that they wanted to impose certain sanctions on the Islamic Republic in order to cripple Iran.
Later on, I will explain what measures they adopted, what happened and what the result of their actions was.
On the one hand, there are the enemies who are making efforts in this vast arena of confrontation between the Iranian nation and its enemies and on the other hand, there are the great achievements which show the capacity, power and intelligence of our great nation.
This vast arena is like the arena of competition between powerful athletes, which involves efforts and exhaustion, but a true champion achieves victory in such arenas and makes everybody praise him.
In this great arena that lies in front of our eyes, the champion is the Iranian nation.
Anybody who studies this arena carefully and appropriately will praise the Iranian nation, just as we hear perceptive people throughout the world praising our nation today.
Among the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation, there are certain political and academic elites and certain experienced individuals who are watching the conditions and are praising the Iranian nation.
It is necessary to see what results are produced by the efforts that are made throughout the country.
Who are these people?
I will speak about this issue later on.
The enemies who do not want to see the Iranian nation making comprehensive progress are pursuing two main goals. One of their goals is to create as many obstacles in the way of our nation as they can in order to prevent the Iranian nation from achieving progress and development.
They try to achieve this goal through sanctions, threats, keeping our managers busy with secondary issues and diverting the attention of the great Iranian nation and outstanding personalities of the country to issues that are not on the list of our priorities. The second goal is to deny our advances in their propaganda campaigns. Today there is a massive propaganda network in the world with thousands of different types of media outlets whose goal is to prove that there are no advances in Iran, to deny the victories that the Iranian has achieved, to magnify the existing weaknesses and attract everybody's attention to them, and to hide the strengths that exist in different parts of the country and are visible to just and impartial people.
In his official addresses, the American president speaks about Iran's economic problems as if he is speaking about his victories.
He proudly says that for example, the value of Iran's currency has declined and that there are such and such economic problems in our country.
Of course, he has not mentioned the strengths that our nation enjoys, the positive and constructive efforts that are being made in our country and the great victories that our nation has achieved. And he will never mention such things. We have been faced with this challenge for thirty years and I will present a brief evaluation of the past thirty years later on in my speech.
In this regard, the year 1391, which has come to an end, was one the busiest years for our enemies.
They said that they were determined to cripple the Iranian nation through sanctions.
If the Islamic Republic stands firm, remains vibrant and continues making progress, they will lose credibility in the world.
For this reason, they do their best to stop us and if things get out of hand, they at least try to present a different story in their propaganda campaigns.
They are pursuing these two goals more seriously than in the past: they are trying to create obstacles in our way - through pressure, threats, sanctions and other such things - and they are also launching propaganda campaigns to discount our strengths and to magnify our weaknesses.
As I said, we have certain enemies.
Who are these enemies?
Where is the main den of designing machinations against the Iranian nation?
It is not difficult to answer this question.
It is 34 years that whenever the word "enemy" is mentioned, the Iranian nation immediately thinks of the American government.
It would be good if American officials paid attention to this point and tried to understand that over the past 34 years, the Iranian people have witnessed things and gone through stages that whenever the word "enemy" is mentioned, they immediately think of America.
This is a very important issue for a government that wants to have pride in the world. This is an issue that deserves careful attention.
America is the center of enmity and designing plots against the Iranian nation.
Of course, there are certain other enemies, but we do not consider them among the first row of our enemies.
For example, there is the Zionist enemy, but the Zionist regime is too small to be considered among the first row of the Iranian nation's enemies.
They threaten us with a military invasion, but I believe even they themselves know - and if they do not, they should know - that if they make a wrong move, the Islamic Republic will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.
The evil English government is also hostile towards the Iranian nation.
The English government is among the old enemies of the Iranian nation, but in this arena it plays a complementary role as the follower of America.
The English government is not independent, so one cannot consider them a separate enemy. It is a follower of America.
There are certain other governments that are hostile towards Iran.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that officials of the French government have been openly hostile towards the Iranian nation over the past few years and this is not a clever move by French government officials.
A wise human being, particularly a wise politician, should never have the motivation to turn a neutral country into an enemy.
We have never had problems with France and the French government, neither in the past nor in the present era. However, since the time of Sarkozy, the French government has adopted a policy of opposing the Iranian nation and unfortunately the current French government is pursuing the same policy.
In our opinion, this is a wrong move. It is ill-advised and unwise.
What they call "the global community" is a few countries, whose main leader is America, followed by the Zionists, the English government and certain other small governments.
The global community is not at all determined to oppose Iran, Iranians and Islamic Iran. Now that we are supposed to have an evaluation of the year 1391, I should mention that the Americans started their new plans from the beginning of the year 1391.
They imposed harsh sanctions from the beginning of the year 1391 - sanctions on oil and sanctions on banking and monetary transactions between the Islamic Republic and other countries. They did many other things in this regard.
They show malice and opposition, yet they expect the Iranian nation not to realize that they are hostile.
A few years ago in my speech on the first day of Farvardin, I said here at Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha's (a.s.) shrine that you [Americans] should be careful, that your proclaimed affection and friendship should not mean that you are wearing a velvet glove over an iron fist, pretending that you are our friends while being hostile in your hearts.
The Americans sent special agents to prevent Iran from selling oil and transferring the money to the country. America chose certain outstanding and experienced agents to travel to different countries and even speak to heads of certain companies in order to encourage them to stop oil-related transactions with the Islamic Republic.
These agents were tasked with punishing those who had financial relationships or oil-related transactions with the Islamic Republic.
They started this work with full intensity from the beginning of the year 1391, particularly from Mordad.
Of course, as I said a few months ago, the Americans expressed joy and said that I have confessed to the effect of the sanctions. Yes, the sanctions have not been inconsequential. If they are happy about this, let them be happy.
The flaw that our economy is suffering from is that it is dependent on oil.
We need to distance our economy from oil. Our governments should include this among their basic plans.
Seventeen, eighteen years ago, I told the government of that time and its officials that they should act in a way that we could shut down our oil wells whenever we wanted to.
The so-called "technocrats" smiled in disbelief, as if to say, "Is that even possible?"
Yes, it is possible. It is necessary to follow up the issue, take action and make plans.
When economic plans of a country are built on a particular base, the enemies of that country will target that base.
Yes, the sanctions have had an effect, but not the effect that the enemies wanted.
I will explain this issue later on. This is all I wanted to say about the issue of economy. On the political front, throughout the year 1391 they tried to "isolate" Islamic Iran in the world.
That is to say, they tried to shake the faith of other governments in their relations with Iran and in the Islamic Republic. They tried to prevent the Islamic Republic from promoting and implementing its policies in the region, in the world and in the country.
What happened was the exact opposite of what they wanted.
Two thirds of the nations of the world are members of the Non-Aligned Movement. Heads of other countries took part in the Tehran summit.
Everybody felt that the Iranian nation was praiseworthy.
They said this in their meetings with us and in the interviews they gave. They also said the same thing when they returned to their home countries.
What happened was the exact opposite of what the enemies of the Iranian nation wanted.
They failed to do what they wanted.
In the case of domestic policies, the purpose of their sanctions was to make the Iranian nation uncertain about their path, to distance the Iranian nation from the Islamic Republic and to make the people disappointed.
On the 22nd of Bahman, the people of Iran gave them a powerful punch in the mouth with their massive presence, with their enthusiasm and with the affection that they expressed for Islam, the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic Republic.
In the area relating to security, they tried to undermine our national security and the details have been explained to the people by our government officials in their interviews and speeches.
On the political front, they once again witnessed the power and influence of the Islamic Republic in the region.
In the case of the regional issues, they even admitted that no major problem will be solved in the region in the absence of Iran and its vote.
In the case of the Zionist regime's invasion of Gaza, the powerful presence of the Islamic Republic behind the scenes caused them to admit that they had been defeated by Palestinian combatants.
We did not announce this: it was they themselves who announced and insisted that if it had not been for the presence of the Islamic Republic and its show of power, Palestinian combatants could not have even put up a resistance against Israel, let alone bring Israel to its knees.
In the 8-day war, the Palestinians managed to bring Israel to its knees, and this was the first time in the history of the fake and usurping Zionist regime.
As I said, their efforts were not completely inconsequential.
The sanctions caused the massive domestic capacities of the Iranian nation to become activated. The sanctions motivated us to start doing great things.
Our youth made certain achievements that would have been impossible in the absence of the sanctions. In the area of infrastructure, in terms of the achievements that were made last year, the year 1391 stands out among the previous years.
A massive amount of work was done in the area of infrastructure, in the area of building roads, in the area of energy, in the area of discovering new oil reserves, in the area of discovering new sources of uranium, in the area of building and developing power plants and refineries, and in tens of other great industrial areas.
One example is the great scientific advances that we made in the year 1391.
In the area of science and technology, certain things were done which were remarkable and a genuine source of joy for those who have faith in the future prospects of the country.
That is to say, the year in which they were determined to be harsh towards the Iranian nation, our honorable youth and scientists launched the Nahid satellite into space. They launched the Pishgam explorer which was carrying a living creature.
When this living creature was sent into space and was returned safely, international scientists and observers were so surprised that they first denied it.
Then when they realized that they had no choice but to accept the truth and after witnessing reality and the evidence, they were forced to acknowledge it.
In the area of health and biomedical engineering, great achievements were made, achievements which are related to the health of the people.
We achieved the first rank in the region in the area of biotechnology.
Outstanding technical achievements were made in this area which led to the production of different kinds of pharmaceuticals.
All these achievements were made in a year in which the enemies were determined to be harsh towards the Iranian nation in order to deprive it from a good life and from all the products of human talent.
In the same year, we were the first in the region in terms of production of knowledge in the area of several important scientific fields.
In terms of achievements in science and technology competitions, our students' accomplishments were 31 percent more than the previous year.
In the year 1391, the number of our university students increased so much that we had 25 times more students than the early years after the Revolution.
The number of students who are studying in our universities is 25 times more than the early years of the Revolution.
These are examples of the great achievements that the Iranian nation has made.
In the areas relating to water, in the areas relating to the natural environment, in the area of stem cell research, in the area of alternative energy, in the area of medicinal herbs and in the area of nuclear energy, our country managed to accomplish great achievements.
All of these achievements were made in a year in which the enemies of the Iranian nation had focused all their efforts on stopping our nation.
The events that happened in the year 1391 contain a big lesson for us. The lesson is that a vibrant nation will never be brought to its knees as a result of the enemies' threats, pressure and harsh measures.
It became clear to us and to all those who follow up the issues of Iran that what is important for a nation is relying on its own capacities, trusting Allah the Exalted, having faith in itself and not relying on its enemies.
This is what can help a nation move forward.
The year 1391 was like a war game for us.
Of course, we identified our weaknesses as well. After all, this is the purpose of war games.
In a military exercise, military units identify both their weaknesses and their strengths and they try to eliminate their weaknesses.
We identified our weaknesses.
Our economic weaknesses - which led to harsh conditions for certain groups of people - include dependence on oil, disregarding large-scale economic policies of the country and adopting policies and decisions on a day-to-day basis.
Government officials of the country - the incumbent officials and officials who will be elected through this year's presidential elections - should pay attention to this point.
Another great lesson that we learnt was that our country enjoys firm foundations.
When the foundations of a country become firm, the effect of the enemies' hostile actions is minimized.
In this great country which enjoys firm foundations, if government officials accept their responsibility and adopt wise measures, if managers stay together and cooperate - which is my constant advice to our government officials and managers - if our managers act in a wise and intelligent way, then we can turn every threat into an opportunity, just as we did in the year 1391 and managed to move forward.
What our government officials and dear people achieved in the year 1391 will hopefully reveal its effects in the life of the people in the future.
Of course, the economy of the country is an important issue and I have constantly stressed its importance over the past few years, but it is not the only issue. Our national security is important too. Public health is important too.
If our country makes progress in science, all the other things will become easy.
Regional influence and power of a nation is the support of its independence and national security, and it is important.
We have made progress in all these areas.
We have made progress in the area of security, in the area of health, in the area of gaining international influence and in the area of controlling different events that happen in the country and in the region.
Through its advances, our nation proved that refusing to live under the hegemony of America does not mean backwardness. This is an important point.
Powerful people of the world and colonialists - at a time when there was direct colonialism - tried to prove to nations of the world that if they wanted to have a good life and make progress, they had to live under their hegemony. And today America is doing the same thing.
The Iranian nation proved that this is a lie.
Our nation proved that being independent of America and other superpowers not only will not cause backwardness, but it will also bring about progress.
There were certain countries that attached themselves to America's tail and followed it.
Thirty years of experience lie in front of our eyes. Notice what has happened in the thirty years that the Islamic Republic has been in power. Notice where the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation used to be and where they are now.
Anybody who studies this issue will realize that being independent of superpowers is an opportunity for a nation, not a threat.
And thankfully the Iranian nation has achieved this opportunity by relying on its power, its courage and its intelligence.
In certain cases, we acted like this and we witnesses the resulting success.
One example is the issue of producing twenty-percent enriched fuel for the research reactor in Tehran, which produces the important radiopharmaceuticals that our country needs.
This small power plant required twenty-percent enriched fuel.
They decided to use this national need to force the Islamic Republic to give in to their imposition and hegemony.
Before the conditions became critical, our youth and scientists managed to produce twenty-percent enriched fuel and they turned it into fuel rods that were needed at the power plant.
Our opponents could not guess that we would be able to do what we did.
However, our government officials identified this need in time and started working.
While they expected that the Islamic Republic would beg them for twenty-percent enriched fuel, the Islamic Republic announced that it had produced twenty-percent enriched uranium inside the country and that it did not need the enemies.
If our scientists and youth had not done what they did, today we would have to go to those who are not our friends and ask them for either twenty-percent enriched uranium or radiopharmaceuticals.
Our government officials identified this need in time and they did what they had to do.
For this reason, we achieved a victory. This should be the general plan in the case of all our national issues and needs. Administrations, industrialists, farmers, capitalists, entrepreneurs, researchers and designers of scientific and industrial projects should all carry out this great responsibility, which is a rational and moral responsibility.
If they want to write scholarly articles, they should adopt this orientation. If they want to do research, they should adopt this orientation.
If they want to engage in industrial, technical or scientific work, they should adopt this orientation.
All of us have a responsibility to make efforts to keep our country impervious and resistant to the enemies.
This is one of the requirements of the idea of "economy of resistance" which I put forward.
In an economy of resistance, one fundamental pillar is resistance of the economy.
The economy must be resistant. It must be able to withstand the enemies' machinations.
This is the first point that I wanted to discuss in this meeting.
The second point is that the Americans send messages to us through different channels, asking us to negotiate with them regarding the nuclear issue. They both send messages to us and discuss the proposal in their global propaganda.
High- and middle-ranking officials of America repeatedly say that alongside the P5+1 talks regarding the nuclear issue, America and the Islamic Republic should hold one-on-one negotiations over the issue. I am not optimistic about such negotiations.
Why?
Because our past experiences show that in the logic of the American gentlemen, negotiation does not mean sitting down together to try to reach a rational solution. This is not what they mean by negotiation.
What they mean is that we should sit down together and talk so that Iran accepts their views.
The goal has been announced in advance: Iran must accept their view. For this reason, we have always announced that this is not negotiation.
I am not optimistic about these statements, but I am not opposed either.
In this regard, there are a few things that I should clarify.
The first point is that the Americans constantly send messages - sometimes in writing - that they are not after regime change in Iran. This is what they are telling us.
The answer is that we are not concerned about whether or not you have intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic although you constantly insist that you do not have such intentions.
Even the day when you had intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and you announced this openly, you could not do anything, and you will not be able to do anything in the future either.
The second point is that the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us that they are sincere in their offers of rational negotiation.
They claim that they sincerely want to have rational negotiations with Iran - that is to say, they claim that they do not want imposition.
In response, I would say, we have told you many times that we are not after nuclear weapons and you say that you do not believe us.
Why would we believe your statements then?
When you are not prepared to accept a rational and sincere statement, why would we accept your statements which have been disproved many times?
Our interpretation is that offers of negotiation are an American tactic to mislead public opinion in the world and in our country.
You should prove that this is not the case.
Can you prove this?
I would like to take this opportunity to say that one of their propaganda techniques is that they sometimes start rumors that certain people have negotiated with the Americans on behalf of the Leader.
This is another propaganda tactic and a downright lie.
So far nobody has negotiated with them on behalf of the Leader.
The third point is that on the basis of our experiences and careful analysis of the existing conditions, our interpretation is that the Americans do not want the nuclear negotiations to end.
The Americans do not want the nuclear conflict to be resolved, otherwise if they wanted these negotiations to reach a solution, the solution would be very close by and easy to reach.
In the nuclear issue, Iran only wants the world to recognize its right to enrichment, which is Iran's natural right.
Government officials of the countries that are claiming to be after a solution should admit that the Iranian nation has a right to domestic nuclear enrichment for peaceful purposes.
Is this too much to expect? This is what we have always demanded, and it is exactly what they do not want [us to have].
They say they are concerned that we might go after producing nuclear weapons.
The ones who are saying this are no more than a few countries whose names I mentioned earlier, and they call themselves "the global community".
They say that the global community is concerned.
No, the global community is not at all concerned.
The majority of the countries in the world are on the Islamic Republic's side and they support our demand because it is a legitimate demand.
We were never opposed to the supervision and regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Whenever we are close to a solution, the Americans cause a problem in order to prevent reaching a solution.
My assumption and interpretation is that their goal is to keep the issue unresolved so that they can have a pretext for exerting pressure on us.
And as they themselves said, the purpose of the pressure is to cripple the Iranian nation. Of course, much to the dismay of the enemy, the Iranian nation will not be crippled.
The fourth point regarding this issue is that if the Americans sincerely want to reach a solution, I will give them the solution.
The solution is that the Americans should stop being hostile towards the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
This is the right solution: they should stop being hostile if they want to put an end to the problems that exist between us - and they announce that they really want to resolve the problems that exist between Iran and America.
It is thirty-four years that different American administrations have designed various kinds of hostilities towards us based on a wrong understanding of Iran and the Iranians.
Since the first year after the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, they have been hostile towards us.
They have worked against our economy.
Therefore, I would like to give a piece of advice to American officials: if they are after a rational solution, the rational solution is that they should rectify their policies. They should rectify the way they act and they should stop being hostile towards the Iranian nation.
I would like to briefly discuss another issue: the crucial issue of elections.
In our country, elections are the manifestation of "political valor".
Elections are the manifestation of political valor, the manifestation of the power of the Islamic Republic, the manifestation of the pride and credibility of the Islamic system. The credibility of the Islamic Republic depends on elections, the presence of the people at polling stations and their votes that elect managers of the country.
Elections are the manifestation of our national willpower, the manifestation of Islamic democracy.
Therefore, because of the importance that our elections enjoy, the enemies of the Iranian nation have always tried to take enthusiasm and excitement out of the elections.
They have designed plots to prevent the people from going to the ballot boxes.
Over the years that we have held many elections - including parliamentary and presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to decrease voter turnout and make our elections less enthusiastic, and this is because of the significant role that elections play in the affairs of our country.
Now I would like to discuss a few points regarding the elections. Of course, the elections are more than two months away.
For the time being, there are a few points that I would like to discuss.
The first point is that what is most important is massive presence of the people in the elections.
Enthusiastic elections in the country and the presence of the people at the polling stations can neutralize the threats by the enemies. It can disappoint the enemy. It can ensure the security of the country.
Our dear people in all parts of the country should know this. Their massive presence at the polling stations plays a role in the future of the country, in our national security, in our independence, in our national wealth, in our economy and in all other important issues of the country.
Therefore, the first point is that with Allah's assistance and with the determined efforts of the Iranian nation, there should be a massive voter turnout in the elections.
The second point is that all political orientations and currents that have faith in the Islamic Republic should take part in the elections.
This is both a right and a responsibility that lies on the shoulders of everybody.
Elections do not belong to a particular political orientation or a particular intellectual and political current.
All those who believe in the Islamic Republic and in the independence of the country, all those who care about the future of the country, all those who care about our national interests should take part in the elections.
Turning away from the elections is appropriate for those who are opposed to the Islamic Republic.
The third point is that it is the votes of the people that determine everything.
You should research, observe carefully and consult those you trust so that you can identify and vote for the most qualified candidate.
The Leader has only one vote.
Just like the rest of our people, I have only one vote and until the time I cast my vote into the ballot box, nobody will know what my vote is.
The people at the polling station might decide to open the ballot box, identify my handwriting and find out who I have voted for.
If such a claim is made, it is false.
Of course, unfortunately these days different statements are commonly attributed to different people through the use of the new means of communication - short message services and other such things.
A person might send thousands of text messages.
I have reports that during the elections, several hundreds of millions of text messages might be sent and received every day.
Take care not be influenced by such things.
Of course, every citizen or political activist may try to encourage others to vote for a particular candidate. Nothing is wrong with this. However, in this regard nobody will hear anything from me.
In the meantime, the people can speak to one another, give advice, try to change each other's opinion and help one another to identify the most qualified candidate.
In any case, the criterion is the votes of the people.
The fourth point is that everybody should accept the rule of law, be it elections or anything else.
The events of the year 1388 - which inflicted losses on the country - took place because certain people decided not to accept the law. They decided not to accept the votes of the people.
For example, the people might vote against what I want, but I must accept their vote.
Everybody must accept what the majority of the people vote for.
It is necessary to use these legal channels.
When what has happened goes against what we want, it is an irreversible mistake to call on the people to protest in the streets, and this was what happened in the year 1388.
This was an experience for our nation, and our nation will always stand up against such events.
The last point is that everybody should know that the characteristics that are needed in the next president include the existing advantages [of previous presidents] minus the weaknesses.
Every incoming president should enjoy the advantages that his predecessors had and should not suffer from the weaknesses that the previous presidents had.
After all, every person has his own strengths and weaknesses.
Presidents too have their own strengths and weakness.
The strengths that the incumbent government and President enjoy should exist in the next president as well.
That is to say, the governments that come to power one after the other should help us move towards improvement and perfection and gradually we should move towards choosing the best among us.
Those who prepare themselves to enter this arena should move forward with full power and confidence while relying on God.
Dear God, ordain what is in the interest of this country and this nation.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with all of us.
Dear God, make the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and the pure souls of our martyrs satisfied and happy with us.
Make what we said serve Your cause and accept it from us out of Your generosity.
Leader’s Address to People Active in Economic Sector - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 18, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a number of people from economic sectors of the country.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to welcome you dear friends who are active in different economic sectors of the country.
The meeting is the symbol of the government's serious attention to the issue of economy in the current sensitive conditions of the world, the region and the country.
This was my primary purpose for holding this meeting. I wanted to arrange a meeting in the month of Ramadan with those who are active in public and private economic sectors. I wanted to spend a few hours listening to them and I wanted the meeting to be reflected by our domestic media as a sign that the Islamic Republic should pay serious attention to the issue of economy, economic activities and economic progress and that the government and the people should cooperate and make efforts in this regard for reasons which I will speak about later on.
This was the first purpose and it has already been fulfilled because the meeting will be reflected in the media.
This is a message to everybody - including government officials in economic sectors, those who are active in economic sectors throughout the country and all our people. The message is that today we should pay serious attention to the issue of economy.
The second purpose of this meeting - which has thankfully been fulfilled - was to get those who do not work for the government to present the people with a report about the realities in the country, the advances that have been made and the activities that are being carried out.
No, everybody knows my opinion in this regard. I believe that we should see both the positive and the negative points. But I believe today the important point is that our people should know what outcomes their efforts, the efforts of our government officials and the enormous human capacities in the country have produced.
You should know that I am in contact with the people: they do not know about these advances.
The majority of the people do not know about what you said today about different areas. I took notes and by Allah's favor, a detailed report will be prepared.
We see that great achievements are being made in the country and the honor belongs to the Iranian nation.
It is the people who are doing these things.
We have made good advances in sectors related to production, services, agriculture, industry, knowledge-based industries and different other areas which were discussed in this meeting.
It is good if people hear these things from individuals in charge of different sectors who are independent of the government. These things would make the people hopeful and happy.
All of us should pay attention to the point that one of the techniques that the enemies of the Iranian nation use in their psychological warfare is to spread despair among the people. I stress this point.
The tone should not undermine the existing hope and determination.
The tone should convey the feeling that, for example, forty percent of the job has been done and that the ground has been prepared for the other sixty percent to be done.
One point is that I named this year "The Year of Economic Jihad".
The policy of the arrogant powers is to defeat the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic by using the economy.
Although the sanctions have been imposed on us under the pretext of the nuclear issue, they are lying. The nuclear issue is not the reason behind the sanctions.
You may remember that the major sanctions which were initially imposed on our country happened at a time when there was no mention of nuclear energy in the country.
For example, the sanctions known as the "D'Amato-Kennedy Bill" - which were of course not very important and were proposed and followed up in the US Congress by somebody called D'Amato - were passed when the issue of nuclear energy was not even being discussed.
The goal of the sanctions that have been imposed on us is to cripple our economy.
Of course the Iranian nation has the honor of having tolerated these sanctions for 32 years.
Of course the sanctions that have been imposed on us during the recent years have grown in number and variety. However, the growth is insignificant compared to the growth in the number and variety of constructive activities in the country. Thirty years ago when they started imposing sanctions on us, their sanctions were more likely to hurt us than the sanctions that they currently impose on us and they repeatedly promise that they will increase their sanctions.
It is necessary to become familiar with the opposing camp. It is necessary to become familiar with the enemy's tools and weapons and to prepare weapons that would make his weapons ineffective.
This requires economic jihad.
Not all activities can be called jihad.
Only certain kinds of activities with certain characteristics can be called jihad.
One of the main characteristics of jihad is being faced with an aggressive position.
An activity with such characteristics can be called jihad.
Therefore, economic jihad means the Iranian nation's persistent, comprehensive and purposeful movement with the intention of rendering the aggressive and spiteful efforts of the enemy ineffective.
The next point is that in the 20-Year Strategic Plan - which is an essential and high-level document for reference - our country is supposed to achieve the top position in the region in important and vital areas. We need to achieve this position.
Naturally others will not stand by and watch us achieve the first position. They are working hard.
We are witness to strenuous economic efforts by some of the regional countries in areas in which we want to become the top country. Of course we are not using some of the means that they are currently using and we will never do so.
Therefore, this requires jihad.
We need both speed and prudence so that we can achieve the first position.
Becoming the top country in the region is not just a whim. No, we want to become the top country because the destiny of our nation depends on it.
If a country fails to fulfill its needs and make progress in the area of economy, knowledge and infrastructure that are necessary for progress, it will be oppressed in a merciless way.
We do not want to be oppressed.
Our country has been subjected to oppression and transgression for two hundred years.
This oppression was the result of the weakness of incompetent, corrupt and materialistic monarchies and the dynamism that their enemies enjoyed.
The English first infiltrated and interfered in the political system of our country in the year 1800. They recruited supporters for themselves. And certain other European countries accompanied them and did the same things.
In the year 1800 when the first English ambassador entered our country, he started to bribe people and buy supporters as soon as he got off the ship in the city of Bushehr. The ambassador was coming from India. It was when the English had the Indian government under control.
All those princes, emirs and other people with such impressive-sounding titles gave in to the presents of the ambassador. The process of oppression by the enemies started from that day. Our weak statesmen let the enemy infiltrate the country on that day.
We do not want this process to continue.
The Revolution has presented them with an insurmountable obstacle.
We want to strengthen this obstacle.
We must not at all allow them to interfere in our economy, culture, politics and destiny.
Economy is one of the important pillars of this domestic strength.
This is why we say we must become the top country in the region.
It is not just a whim. No, the destiny of our nation depends on it.
Therefore, persistent, clever, sincere and effective efforts - which utilize all capacities of the country - play a role in this regard.
This was what I had heard and I saw it for myself after the Revolution and the resultant advances in the country.
Before the Revolution, nobody would have believed the progress that has been made in the country in the area of building dams.
The gentleman who spoke in this meeting referred to building dams as an example, but the same is true of many other areas. There was a day when it was impossible to convince people that such scientific progress would be made in the country. Today we can see these advances in front of our eyes.
I have realized through experience that there is nothing that our youth are incapable of doing when the necessary infrastructure has been prepared. Any thing for which the necessary infrastructure has been prepared can be done by our youth. We enjoy such human resources in the country.
This is a very important point.
Our economic potential is also very important.
Once I said that considering the proportion of our population to the population of the world, we enjoy a disproportionately large number of vital mines and natural resources.
Similarly the area of our country is around one percent of the total land area of our planet. Well, we should have one percent of the total essential natural resources, but in certain cases we have 3, 4 or 5 percent of the total resources.
These are important capacities and they are very valuable.
The shortage of water in the country that has been rightly pointed out can be fully addressed with clever scientific and technological plans. Some of the friends who spoke in this meeting mentioned this point and I have made the same point previously. With a little care and progress, we can compensate for the shortcoming that we are suffering from.
Therefore, our country has genuinely extraordinary capacities in terms of natural resources.
The same is true of our geographical position.
We are connected to two different seas.
We are connected to international waters and the sensitive region that lies between the east and the west - namely, Asia and Europe. We are located in one of the most important spots of this sensitive region. The two seas provide us access to the west and the east.
These are all advantages that we enjoy.
As was mentioned, one fourth of the time for the 20-Year Strategic Plan has passed.
One four-year plan - namely, the fourth development plan - is over. This year is the first year of the fifth development plan.
Of course many things were done during the fourth development plan.
According to the accurate reports that were presented in this meeting, very important things have been done. But there are certain other things that have not been done yet.
The policies that have been announced regarding reforming the norms of consumption, the general policies of our bureaucratic system, the general employment policies and the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution - all these policies are in harmony.
If we manage to formulate and implement the plan on the basis of these policies, we will manage to make far better use of the capacities that I spoke about.
These policies create a kind of cohesion and this cohesion between different layers ensures economic dynamism.
Of course some of the goals that had been specified in the fourth development plan were not achieved. Many factors were involved: both domestic and international issues were involved.
Among the goals that have not been achieved are the 8 percent growth, reducing unemployment, the percentage of investment that had been specified and the issue of reducing inflation which I spoke about previously.
We need to intensify our labor so that we can compensate for the past shortcomings.
According to Article 44 of the Constitution, we had to limit the ownership and economic activities of the government and we did so. What was the goal?
The goal was to create a competitive economy with the presence of the private sector and its investments in the economy of the country.
According to calculations, the amount of money that is required for investment over this five-year period is around 160 billion dollars.
And this is something that must be done.
Good things have been done regarding the implementation of the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution, but what has been done so far is not enough. It is necessary to improve our performance. It is not just a matter of privatizing economic enterprises and leaving the arena.
Healthy activities are always accompanied by unhealthy activities.
I have been stressing the issue of economic corruption for several years.
When I first pointed out the issue, a number of people came to me and said that because I was stressing the issue of economic corruption, our investors might be frightened to enter economic activities.
I told them that my comments would have the opposite effect and that investors would be encouraged to engage in economic activities.
If an investor who wants to engage in a lawful and honorable business knows that the government will prosecute those who violate the law, he will be encouraged more.
We are opposed to those who give rise to corruption and those who abuse their position. An investor who helps the country through his presence, his ideas, his money, his investments and his entrepreneurial activities, should be encouraged and praised. Therefore, fighting economic corruption is an essential principle in this regard and it is necessary to observe this principle.
Fortunately all or most of our ministers and government officials in charge of economic activities are present in this meeting.
Well, you heard the comments of those who spoke in this meeting: both the comments about your strengths and the suggestions which were indicative of the existence of certain shortcomings. I hereby ask our government officials to carefully think about the comments they heard today.
We must not let comments be made and then do nothing.
Mr. Tavakkoli complained that you did not mention the negative points. I would disagree with him because when you suggest that a certain thing should be done, it means that it has not been done yet and this shows that there are certain shortcomings and problems.
He should only pay careful attention to the suggestions which were made in this meeting and I believe they were good suggestions that deserve investigation. There are many things that remain to be said in this regard. I will only make a few recommendations.
The first recommendation is about full implementation of the policies that have been formulated to support the production sector. Production is the basis of economy.
Production is the main pillar of our economy. Regarding the subsidy redistribution plan and the enormous efforts that the government is making in this area, attention should be paid to supporting the production sector, just as it has been pointed out in the law - namely, the 30 percent that has been specified.
Of course some government officials who spoke with me believe that this 30 percent is not really needed.
Certain sectors may not need government support, but in any case production requires support from the government. The production sector should receive its share of support.
We have certain enterprises that are directly or indirectly hurt by these sanctions and it is necessary to take this point into consideration.
Of course the private sector has certain obligations to fulfill in this regard: economizing on energy consumption, increasing productivity and using new machinery.
Certain government officials complained to me that owners of certain industries are not interested in replacing their old machinery, which produce low output and consume a lot of energy. They complained that even if these people are provided with financial assistance, they will not use it to replace their old machinery with new machinery.
It is necessary to pay attention to this point.
Needless to say, government supervision is very important in this regard. That is to say, the government should provide support and it should also supervise the companies that it supports.
The production sector should be provided with as much financial assistance as has been specified in the law, but care should be taken not to allow the people I spoke about - namely, opportunistic people - to use government's financial assistance for other purposes. I have received reports that different kinds of such diversions have happened in the country.
It is necessary to deal with such things in a decisive way so that honest producers who are interested in hard work and production can fulfill their responsibilities.
The next point is the issue of imports which was briefly mentioned in this meeting and which I have discussed on many occasions with government officials in charge of imports.
Of course nobody is opposed to importing, but it is necessary to regulate and to control imports.
Just because we want certain goods to be available on the market on certain occasions - for example, during Norouz - is not a good justification for increasing imports.
It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production when making decisions about imports.
Of course it is said that imports contribute to competitiveness of domestic production. It is argued that in the absence of imports, domestic producers would not pay attention to the quality or final price of their products.
I believe the logic behind this argument is not strong.
Regarding the issue of imports, I would like to draw special attention to the agricultural sector. I believe importing agricultural products requires a far stronger justification than is currently presented.
In the agricultural sector we produce outstanding products.
One of the gentlemen presented a report about our produce.
In the area of produce, our country is among the best in the world in terms of quality.
We should be able to increase our products.
We should export these garden and farm products so that the world understands what is going on in Iran and we must not import the same products with far worse quality from Latin America or other places.
The next point is related to the issue of exports.
Of course the government has a duty to support exports and exporters.
As one of the gentlemen reported, fortunately there has been a very good growth in non-oil exports and we will have a faster growth in the future. We expect non-oil exports to grow appropriately so that our exports become more than our imports.
This is the point we should reach and we should be independent of oil revenues.
Dependence on oil revenues is one of the most important economic woes of our country and it has not just plagued our economy: it has been a general problem.
We must reach a point where we can stop our exports due to political or economic considerations for a period of 15 days or one month if we decide to do so. I made this point several years ago, but at that time our government officials did not welcome my suggestion.
Imagine what would happen in the world.
Today we cannot do so because we are in need of oil revenues.
If one day our economy becomes independent of oil revenues and oil exports, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will manage to gain this advantage, which will have an extraordinary effect on the world.
This is the point we must reach. Well, this requires support. It is necessary to support exports.
On the other hand, our exporters and those in charge of exports have certain duties to fulfill. Wrong actions of our exporters would show their effect in the case the countries that are the major destinations of our exports. It is bad to send low-quality products and products with unfavorable packaging and it is bad to have delays in delivery.
Successful companies throughout the world have managed to keep their customers satisfied for 100 or 150 years.
For example, imagine a German or Swiss company that has been selling a certain product for 150 or 160 years and it still has its customers in our country and other countries.
Why?
Exporters must take these points into consideration.
This requires a culture, the culture of developing high-quality products that are supposed to be sent to foreign countries.
The issue of fighting economic corruption is also very important.
As long as there is nobody on the inside to help an outsider, that outsider cannot give rise to economic corruption.
Therefore, government officials have a responsibility to be extremely sensitive in governmental organizations to the emergence and infiltration of economic corruption.
For example, when you examine a sample of chickens on a chicken farm and find out that a certain disease has started in that place, you do not show mercy because you know that if you fail to take action out of consideration for that particular chicken farm, then the consequences will not be limited to a few thousand chickens.
The same is true of corruption.
I am addressing to this point to our government officials: if you feel or see that there is a possibility for corruption in governmental organizations, you must not hesitate.
Economic corruption is a syndrome that spreads very fast and is highly contagious. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point.
Preparing a comprehensive plan for the development of the cooperative sector is one of the things that is absolutely necessary to do. The issue of our cooperative sector has been stressed in the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution.
We need a complete and comprehensive policy for the cooperative sector and this is something that must be done.
The points which were raised by one of the gentlemen about offering banking facilities to small businesses and other such issues can be taken care of through the cooperative sector.
This is practical. Another essential point is that we must make serious efforts to point out investment opportunities to the private sector.
That is to say, those who are active in the private sector should know what the investment opportunities are. Everybody should be informed of the opportunities and the information should not just be available to a particular group of people.
Those who have this information will be able to abuse it.
Such information should be available to everybody.
Of course this issue was pointed out in previous administrations as well and certain things have been done in the 9th and 10th administrations, but what has been done is not enough.
It is necessary to take other actions in this regard.
I have written down other points which I will not discuss because it is almost time for adhan.
By Allah's favor, those who love the country, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic and those who are interested in the future of this nation will be encouraged by this meeting to have a more serious presence in the arena of economic activities.
The slogan of "Intensified Effort and Labor", which I introduced last year, should be considered along with the issue of "Economic Jihad".
By Allah's favor, everybody will work hard.
The future of the country is bright. The capacities of the country are extraordinary and unique.
Thankfully there are many people in the country with good hearts, good determination, good and competent hands and insightful eyes.
Our country has far too much potential to be considered a second rate country in the world.
Our historical background, our cultural heritage, the capabilities of our people, our natural resources - all of these things dictate this fact to us.
Leader’s Public Address in Mashhad - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of a public address delivered on March 21, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution at Imam Ridha's shrine in the holy city of Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon the Holy Prophet, the most noble descendant of Adam, our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me an opportunity to have this valuable experience again: being present at Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha's shrine - may our souls be sacrificed for his sake and God's greetings be upon him.
I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this great and impressive meeting on the auspicious occasion of Norouz and the beginning of the new year. The people who have gathered here are in fact a sample of the Iranian people.
On the first day of the year, our dear people travel to the holy shrine of Imam Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha from nearby and distant cities and towns of the country in order benefit from the blessedness of this holy place.
Our dear brothers from the city of Mashhad are also present in this impressive gathering.
I extend my greetings and congratulations to all of you.
The Iranian New Year is a valuable opportunity for all Iranian people and for all Muslims who celebrate Norouz to contribute to the Islamic movement.
This is the characteristic of Islam: all opportunities, all moments and all stages of life should be utilized to bring about perfection and spiritual and material progress for humanity. We Iranians can use this occasion to move towards what Islam has demanded from us and towards Islamic teachings and Islamic ahkaam [Islamic rules extracted from religious texts through Islamic jurisprudence].
This is an opportunity for us to become familiar with the lofty goals of Islam.
Visiting one's relatives, paying attention to Allah the Exalted, learning good things from one another, gathering in religious and spiritual centers - these are valuable opportunities that we should benefit from.
The fact is that for many years, especially during the rule of the Islamic system, the honorable people of our country have used Norouz as an opportunity to engage in spirituality and to get closer to Allah the Exalted.
If you pay attention, you will notice that during the first few hours of the new year most people gather in religious centers and holy places to pray.
The meaning of this significant move is that the Iranian nation uses this traditional occasion for religious purposes.
We should follow this prominent example in all affairs, and we should use Norouz to increase our knowledge, spirituality and piety and to practice Islamic ahkaam, Islamic teachings and Islamic ethics.
I hope Allah the Exalted will make all of us successful in this regard.
Today I will take this opportunity to speak about three issues.
First I will present a brief report of the year 1389: I will consider the issue from a broad perspective and explain the orientation of the Iranian nation and officials in the year 1389. Then I will speak about the new year, which starts from today. I will speak about this year's slogan - namely, "Economic Jihad" - and the appropriate measures that should be taken.
In the third part of my speech I will speak about the regional issues: the issues of the Middle East, North Africa and the events that are happening in this Islamic region. I will discuss these issues in the light of the hypocrisy and plots of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah.
Regarding the first issue, I can say that last year's slogan - namely, "Intensified Effort and Labor" - was observed throughout the year. Our people managed to make intensified efforts in different areas.
Of course intensified effort and labor reveal their effects in the long term, but it is possible to see the signs of intensified effort and labor when you take a brief look at the year 1389, what the government officials did and how our dear people cooperated with their officials.
The signs are clearly visible in many areas.
Let us start with science and technology.
At the beginning of the year 1389 I found the opportunity to visit an important industrial center of the country. During the last few days of the year I found another opportunity to visit a technology exhibition, and I saw the long-term results of the year-long movement with my own eyes.
In the area of advanced science and technology, I would tell you that what we have achieved in the country is far more than what the people know about.
A prominent scientific movement started in different areas several years ago, and fortunately this movement has gained further momentum on a daily basis.
Once I quoted an infallible Imam (a.s.), saying, "Knowledge is grandeur." It means that knowledge is a source of power for nations and individuals.
This is a characteristic of knowledge and technology.
Today the country is clearly moving towards obtaining knowledge in many areas, especially in newly-established and highly advanced fields.
Fortunately one can see that our scientists and youth are making accelerated progress in different areas - in biotechnology, in aerospace technology, in nanotechnology, in stem cell research, in producing crucial radiopharmaceuticals, in producing antineoplastic drugs, in producing wind turbines which decrease the country's dependence on oil to a large extent, in building supercomputers which are extremely important for the country, in technologies related to new sources of energy. All of these achievements require advanced knowledge.
As I said last night in my New Year address, the reports prepared by prestigious international centers show that in this area our country is moving forward faster than many countries in the world. These reports show that the pace of our progress is several times more than the average rate of progress in the world.
There are 2, 3 important points about scientific and technological progress which I would like to discuss now.
The first point is that most of the scientists who are doing these things are young.
The average age of the scientists who are involved in these endeavors is 35. That is to say, they are mostly young, and it is necessary to trust these youth. Of course there are also experienced and faithful professors who are involved in these scientific endeavors, and this is very valuable.
The next point is that those who do these impressive things have a lot of self-confidence, and this self-confidence is the main asset.
Manpower is the main asset, and this is what our country enjoys.
Our youth are making progress in this arena with high morale, and they believe that they can do anything, anything for which the country has the necessary infrastructures.
The next point regarding the issue of scientific progress is that the chain of science, technology, production and commercializing the products is in the process of being established. And this chain is very important.
That is to say, we produce knowledge, turn it into technology, develop products, market the products through international trade and produce wealth for the country.
This is the way in which production of knowledge contributes to national wealth and addresses the needs of the people.
Our dear people should know that all economic experts - both the experts who agree with the economic views of the current administration and the experts whose economic views are different from the views of the current administration - unanimously agree that redistributing subsidies is necessary, essential and very constructive.
Entering this arena was very difficult, and the ground was not fully prepared.
Thankfully this work has already been initiated.
To be fair, the cooperation between the government and the people was excellent.
The people offered excellent cooperation when practicing the Subsidy Redistribution Law. The effects of this policy will gradually become clear in the future, although some of the positive effects have already revealed themselves.
The primary goal of the law is to distribute subsidies in a fair way. The government distributes subsidies among the people.
This is a great leap towards establishing social justice.
Managing the consumption of the country's resources - especially water and energy resources - is the second goal.
I named the 1387 as "The Year of Reforming the Norms of Consumption" meaning being economical and avoiding waste.
The Subsidy Redistribution Law is one of the ways in which we can truly reform the norms of consumption.
Energy consumption has been reduced during the few months that the Subsidy Redistribution Law has been practiced, and this is beneficial to the country.
Wasteful use of bread and flour - which are great divine blessings and a lot of efforts go into producing them - has been reduced. Consumption has been balanced in this regard. This is among the benefits we have already obtained.
Of course, by Allah's favor, there will be many other benefits in the future, and reforming the economic structure is among these benefits.
The increase in non-oil exports was another sign of intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.
Unfortunately our country has depended on oil exports since decades ago.
All economists who care about our country reject this policy, but we have been used to this state of affairs. It is wrong to export oil and use the money to manage the country.
Many years ago I said that one of my wishes is that one day we will be able to run the country without exporting even one single drop of oil.
This has not happened so far. Of course it is very difficult to do this.
Increasing our non-oil exports helps us move closer to this goal, and this is already happening.
A great leap was made in this regard in the year 1389.
Confronting the sanctions in an intelligent and firm manner is one of the things that shows intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.
Since the beginning of year 1389 they have been trying to intensify their sanctions on Iran.
According to their calculations, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation should have been brought to their knees in 5-6 months. This was what they thought.
Through the sanctions they wanted to make life so difficult for the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic that the people would protest against the Islamic Republic. This was their goal.
A clever and firm policy was adopted against these sanctions, and the sword of the enemy became blunt.
The enemy did not manage to achieve its goals through these sanctions.
Today westerners admit that imposing sanctions on Iran is no longer effective.
Our country is an oil exporter, but we used to import huge amounts of gasoline, which is produced from oil.
They said that this was the weakness of the Islamic Republic and that they would block gasoline imports.
Thanks to their sanctions, our government officials started to think of a way to produce gasoline, and their efforts helped our country become self-sufficient in gasoline.
I heard similar things from some of the young scientists at the technology exhibition which I visited last month.
They told me, "We wanted to build a machine, and we went abroad to buy the required parts, but they told us that they would not sell them to us because of the sanctions, so we realized that we had to manufacture the required parts as well.
We came back and tried to produce those parts, and we succeeded to do so without the help of foreigners." This is the clever approach.
According to government reports, 1.6 million job opportunities were created in the year 1389. If this report is accurate, the number is half a million more than the expected job opportunities.
Good achievements have also been made in such areas as housing projects, construction of highways and road systems, and electronic services - all of which are related to the infrastructures of the country.
These are the economic achievements.
Many achievements have been made in other areas as well, but I will not discuss them for lack of time.
In any case, thankfully it is clear that the year 1389 was truly "The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor".
Of course the year 1389 does not have any special significance in itself. This year, next year and the following years will all be "The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor".
The Iranian nation and its officials should make intensified efforts all the time so that we can achieve the position that the Iranian nation deserves.
However, experts believe that at this point in time economic issues are more important and more urgent than all other issues of the country.
If our country manages to make jihad-like efforts in economic areas and if the big leap that has been made is coupled with other leaps, this will undoubtedly produce great results for the country, for our progress and for the grandeur of the Iranian nation.
In this regard the important criterion is the accelerated economic growth which has been specified in the fifth development plan - a growth of at least 8 percent.
Productivity should be a large portion of this growth.
In my speech on the first day of the year 1388, I made a few points about the issue of extravagance and the problems that exist in the area of productivity.
The people should know these things.
I recommend that our government officials speak to the people about the importance of increasing the share of productivity in total economic growth of the country. They should tell the people how important it is to increase the share of productivity in economic growth of the country and how important it is to decrease the difference between the income of the poor and the rich.
Such differences are not favorable to us. Islam does not approve of such differences.
They should try to do these things according to the fifth development plan.
Decreasing the unemployment rate is among the crucial issues of the country.
Increasing private investments and helping the private sector to invest in economic projects of the country are also among the crucial issues. In this regard one of the important things that can be done is to establish cooperatives. Cooperatives can accumulate great capital and invest in important economic projects of the country.
It is necessary to prepare the legal requirements in this regard.
This means supporting the blossoming of labor.
As for economy in the use of essential resources, especially water resources, today 90 percent of our water resources are being used up by the agricultural sector.
Just consider what will happen if the government succeeds in reforming the methods of irrigation and reduces this amount by only 10 percent.
We only use 10 percent of our water resources for all other purposes - including household and industrial purposes. Imagine will happen if we spend 10 percent less water in the agricultural sector.
In fact we will have twice as much water for non-agricultural sectors, which is very important.
The direct involvement of the people in economic matters is something necessary.
If we want this great economic movement to take place in our country in the year 1390, certain requirements should be met.
I would like to briefly mention these requirements.
First of all, it is necessary to have the spirit of jihad.
Since the beginning of the Revolution up until now, our people have been successful whenever they have entered the arena with the spirit of jihad. We saw this during the Sacred Defense and during reconstruction of the country. Currently we can see the same thing in the scientific movement of the country.
If we maintain this spirit of jihad in different areas - that is to say, if we do our duty for the sake of God in a tireless and serious manner - this movement will undoubtedly continue.
The second requirement is to strengthen spirituality and the spirit of religious faith in society.
Dear people, everybody should know that piety in our society and among our youth will help our nation in worldly matters as well.
It is wrong to think that piety among the youth reveals its effects only during itikaf in mosques or when reciting Dua Kumeyl.
If the youth enjoy piety, they will stay away from intemperance and addiction to drugs. They will start utilizing their talents and making efforts.
The same is true of economy.
The spirit of piety and spirituality plays a very important role.
The next requirement is that the country should not be distracted by side issues. Most of the time there is a central issue in the country which should be the focus of everybody's efforts.
This is analogous to the situation of a caravan that is on an important mission and is moving through a desert towards its destination, but suddenly something unimportant attracts the attention of the caravan in one part of the desert and it stops moving forward.
Side issues should not be brought into focus.
Preserving unity and national solidarity is another requirement.
It is necessary to maintain and strengthen the unity that exists among and between the people and government officials. The people love their government officials. They trust their officials.
One of the big plots of the enemies of the Iranian nation is to foment discord inside the country under ethnic, religious, political and partisan pretexts.
Fortunately our nation is vigilant.
All those who care about the country and religious democracy - which is a source of pride for the Iranian nation - should cooperate in a harmonious manner.
Government officials should do the same.
I seriously warn our government officials about this issue.
It is possible to negotiate a solution to the most important issues of the world, let alone such trivial issues.
Sometimes after I announce a slogan at the beginning of the year, I see placards hanging everywhere - in Tehran and other cities of the country - with the slogan written on them.
This is useless.
Measures that are sometimes adopted are expensive, yet unnecessary.
What I expect from government officials and from our dear people is that they should listen to these slogans and try to practice them.
In this regard there is no need to do something that is expensive.
Of course the central importance of economic matters does not mean that we should ignore other areas.
It is necessary to pay attention to other areas as well, especially science and technology, and to help and trust our young scientists so that they can make great achievements.
As for the regional issues, the recent events which have happened in the region - in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Bahrain - are very important.
A fundamental change is taking place in this Islamic and Arab region. This is a sign of Islamic Awakening.
The same thing which has been shouted as a slogan in the Islamic Republic for decades is revealing itself in the context of these countries. These developments have two characteristics: one is the presence of the people, and other is the religious orientation of these movements.
These are two essential characteristics.
The physical presence of the people - this is what happened in the Islamic Revolution.
Parties, people who live in their ivory towers and political analysts could not do anything.
The art of our magnanimous Imam was that he managed to encourage the people to enter the arena.
Today the same thing is happening in other countries.
In Egypt and Tunisia it was the people who entered the arena, otherwise intellectuals and those who live in ivory towers were always there and they were talking all along. They often called on the people to protest, but nobody would listen to them.
This time it was the people who entered the arena with a religious orientation.
Friday prayers, congregational prayers, Name of God, religious scholars, promoters of religion, founders of new schools of religious thought in certain countries - these were the elements that encouraged the people to step in.
This is a characteristic of these events.
Why did the people step into the arena?
The oppressive rulers in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries had hurt the pride of the people.
For example, the people of Egypt had to see the leader of their country commit the worst and most hideous crimes for Israel.
If Hosni Mubarak had not cooperated with Israel in the case of the siege on Gaza, Israel could not have pressured the people of Gaza like that.
But Hosni Mubarak stepped in and helped Israel to block the way to Gaza.
Then they realized that the people of Gaza had dug tunnels under the ground. In order to stop the oppressed people of Gaza from using these tunnels, they built steel walls around them which ran 30 meters below the surface and cut through the tunnels.
It was Hosni Mubarak who did this.
Similar things happened in other countries as well.
For example, Gadhafi showed an anti-western attitude during the first few years of his rule, but he has rendered great services to the west during the recent years.
The people of Libya saw that a simple threat was enough to make Gadhafi load all the nuclear facilities of his country onto a ship and tell westerners to take them away.
Just compare the situation of our nation with the Libyan nation.
Not only did our government officials not retreat, but they also increased our nuclear facilities by several times each year against the wish of the enemy.
The same thing can be seen in all the countries whose people have revolted against their governments.
This is important to us.
After these events took place, they adopted contradictory positions because they did not have an appropriate understanding of the events and because they did not know the people.
Of course in the case of these and other countries, America's support for dictators is a point which has been constantly noticed about America's behavior. They supported Hosni Mubarak as long as they could. Then they realized that it was not possible to keep him in power, so they threw him away.
This is a lesson to the leaders of other countries who are dependent on America.
But they supported and defended the dictator until the last moment. What happened was truly intolerable to America and the west.
Egypt is one of the main pillars of America's Middle Eastern policies. They were relying on Egypt.
Then the Americans tried to preserve the structure of the Egyptian regime.
If nations stay vigilant, they can easily expose America's hypocrisy and foil its plots.
After losing Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, the Americans tried to preserve the structure of their regimes.
They overthrew those governments as well. By Allah's favor, America's failures will continue in the region.
After they lost their agents in these countries, they took two courses of action. One was opportunism, and the other was simulation. Through opportunism they tried to hijack these revolutions.
They were unsuccessful in this regard.
Simulation was the second plot - that is to say, they tried to simulate the events of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and certain other countries in Iran, the country that enjoys religious democracy and a populist government.
What they are doing is true hypocrisy: they claim to support nations.
They are hypocritical about Egypt. They say they support the Egyptian people. Our dear people should know that America's President has sent a message to the Iranian nation, saying that he supports them.
Not only do they not show mercy to other nations, but they also show no mercy to their own people.
In spite of America's critical economic situation, the current US President spent hundreds of billions of dollars from the tax paid by US citizens in order to keep banks, arms companies and oil industries going. That is to say, he is spending the money that belongs to the American people on American companies and banks.
Therefore, they do not even show mercy to their own people.
Today the American nation is struggling with the widespread economic crisis, and it does not have a solution.
The torture centers of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and other torture centers are another issue.
They do not understand nations.
Does the current US President know what he is saying?
Does he really understand who are behind his policies, or is he unaware and confused? We do not know the answer to these questions.
He says that the people who had gathered at Tehran's Azadi Square are like the people at Egypt's Tahrir Square.
He is right: each year on the 22nd of Bahman, the people of Iran gather at Azadi Square and shout "death to America".
The position of the Islamic Republic on the regional issues is clear.
We seek to defend nations and their rights.
This is the position of the Iranian nation and the position of the Islamic system. This is the clear position adopted by the Islamic Republic.
These are the policies. These are what the hearts, minds and tongues of our people and government officials say.
There are two things which are worthy of attention. One is the issue of Libya, and the other is the issue of Bahrain.
Regarding the Libyan issue we utterly condemn the behavior of the Libyan government - killing and pressuring the people, dropping bombs on cities and killing civilians. But we also utterly condemn the interference of America and westerners in Libya.
They claim that they want to enter Libya or carry out military operations to defend the people. This is not at all acceptable.
It is one month that the people of Libya are being bombed. If you truly support the Libyan people, if you really care about the Libyan people, you should help them.
You should give them the facilities they need.
Instead of doing these things, they stood by and watched the people being killed for one month. Now they want to step in. Therefore, you have not come to defend the people.
You want to use Libya as a foothold in order to monitor the future revolutionary governments of Egypt and Tunisia, which are located on the east and west of Libya.
Your intention is evil.
The United Nations, which should serve the interests of nations, has unfortunately turned into a tool in the hands of these people. It just provides what they need.
This is a disgrace for the United Nations.
Therefore, the presence of foreign powers and westerners in Libya is totally unacceptable.
If they want to help the people of Libya, the door is open: they can help and equip the people, and the people will settle their issues with Gadhafi and others. Why do you enter Libya?
Their main demand is that there should be elections in which each person can have one vote.
Is this too much to expect? In Bahrain there is a superficial democratic façade, but the Bahraini people cannot really vote. They are being oppressed.
Westerners took this opportunity to interfere in the affairs of the regional countries by bringing up a new issue: the Shia-Sunni issue.
Just because the poor people of Bahrain happen to be Shia, nobody in the world should support them.
The TV channels that used to cover the details of the regional issues should now be silent about the events in Bahrain.
And then some people in Persian Gulf States - whether politicians or journalists - start talking nonsense, saying that the issue of Bahrain is a Shia-Sunni war.
It is the protest of a nation against the oppression that is being imposed on it, just like what happened in Tunisia and Egypt and just like what is happening in Libya and Yemen: there is no difference.
The Americans would be happy to use their propaganda machines in the region and pass off the issue of Bahrain as a Shia-Sunni conflict.
They ask why Iran is supporting the people of Bahrain.
Well, we support everybody.
We have been supporting the Palestinian people for 32 years. Which country, which government and which nation has offered support to the Palestinian nation during the past 32 years?
Are the Palestinian people Shia?
Once our youth went to the airport, prepared to go to Gaza.
They wanted to go to Gaza and fight Israel.
We told them not to go.
Our people expressed their emotions in the case of Gaza, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia and other places.
Therefore, this is not a Shia-Sunni issue.
They are making spiteful and malevolent efforts to present the issue of Bahrain as a Shia-Sunni issue.
Unfortunately some people who do not have any evil motives fell into this trap.
If there are benevolent people involved in this issue, I would like to tell them, "Do not make this a Shia-Sunni issue." This would be the greatest service to America. This would be the greatest service to the enemies of the Islamic Ummah who are trying to present the anti-tyranny movement of a nation as a Shia-Sunni Conflict.
We do not distinguish between Gaza, Palestine, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.
We approve of national movements that shout Islamic slogans and seek freedom.
After the tanks of the Saudi government were deployed in the streets of Manama in Bahrain, the Americans showed how shameless they are when they announced that they do not consider the Saudi involvement in Bahrain as foreign interference. But when our marja taqlids, religious scholars and benevolent people tell them not to kill the people, they accuse us of interference.
Is this interference?
When we tell an oppressive regime not to kill its own people, they call this interference, but when a foreign government deploys its tanks in the streets of Bahrain, they say they do not consider it foreign interference! Such moves, such statements and such propaganda show how shameless the Americans and their regional subordinates are.
The Americans are thousands of kilometers away from this region.
They made a mistake, and anybody else who follows them will make the same mistake.
I say with clarity that, by Allah's favor, a new movement has started in the region.
According to the divine promise, this movement will definitely achieve victory.
The Iranian nation feels proud and happy about being the first to tread this path and remaining steadfast.
Our young generation did not see the Revolution, but they are not less steadfast - if not more so - than the revolutionaries of that time.
Dear God, bestow Your mercy and blessings on our dear nation.
Dear God, increase the honor of those who serve this nation, this movement, Islam and Muslims.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, make the immaculate souls of our martyrs and the pure soul of our magnanimous Imam satisfied with us. Bestow on us of the grace and blessings that You bestowed on them.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 7, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with government officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon the Holy Prophet, our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and chosen household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I would like to welcome the dear brothers and sisters - the hardworking and compassionate officials of the country. I hope Allah the Exalted will make this holy month auspicious for you and the Iranian nation.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me another opportunity to arrange this warm and friendly meeting and exchange ideas about important issues of the country. I will divide my statements into three parts.
The first part is a number of reminders which I myself need to pay attention to more than anybody else. By Allah's favor, this has been inspired by the spirituality of the month of Ramadan. The second part is about our national issues from a general perspective.
In the last part, if there is enough time, I will touch on the regional issues and the events that are happening around us.
The late Hajj Mirza Javad Maleki Tabrizi - the famous mystic and the great Islamic jurisprudent - says in his book "Al-Muraqibat" that fasting is a divine gift that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on believers and His servants.
He says, "Fasting is not an obligation, rather it is an honor for which we should be thankful to God."
He extracted these benefits from Islamic narrations and the knowledge originated from the enlightened heart of this great man.
And it clarifies realities and opens the door to wisdom. It is necessary to use this opportunity. We should think about the passage of time.
Time is the main asset of all human beings.
All good things are gained over time. Time is an asset that can bring about eternal salvation and paradise for human beings.
We should think about the time we have.
We should feel the transient nature of the day and nights of our life.
Life is nothing but winter snow and summer sunshine.
This is while this asset is the only thing that we have in order to achieve salvation in the next world.
We should think about how, where and on what we spend it.
We should think about death, about leaving this world, about the moment we will leave our bodies and about meeting the Angel of Death. This moment is something that will happen to all of us. "Every soul shall taste of death."
How will we feel at that moment? These are some points which deserve reflection. It is absolutely necessary to think about these things.
Duas are another area worthy of reflection.
The concepts that the written duas contain are extraordinary. Hajj Mirza Javad Maleki Tabrizi says in his "Al-Muraqibat" that all the speeches and narrations from the infallible Imams (a.s.) - except for narrations and speeches about monotheism - do not contain even one tenth of the truths and teachings that have been passed down to us in the form of duas.
These duas are very important.
I have a few duas in mind which I will discuss for a few minutes so that they are repeated for those who have already read them and serve as reminders for those who have not.
The beginning of the twentieth dua of Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, which is widely known as Makarim al-Akhlaq, says: "O God, bless Muhammad and his household, adorn me with the adornment of the righteous and clothe me in the ornaments of the God-fearing."
In what ways do we want to be adorned with the adornment of righteous and God-fearing people?
One is "spreading justice". He asks God to help establish justice in society: judicial justice, justice in the sense of dividing vital resources of the country between the people in an equitable way, justice in the sense of dividing opportunities between the people in an appropriate way.
These are the pillars and principles of the kind of piety that is expected of us.
Your ability to suppress your anger is a great virtue if you are an ordinary person and the scope of your anger is limited to a religious brother, a member of your family or one of your employees. "And those who restrain (their) anger and pardon men..." [The Holy Quran, 3: 134] But if you are in charge of something in society and you have a social position, if your words and actions and your approval and rejection affect your society, then your anger is not the same as the anger of an ordinary person.
Such a person may get angry at certain people or currents and he may speak against them, but the effects of his anger are very different from the effects of the anger of an ordinary person who may get angry and beat somebody up, for example. Restrain your anger.
Things should not be done out of anger.
Our Lord, forgive us our faults and our extravagance in our affair.
And through "quenching the flame of hatred".
Everybody should try to put out this fire.
It is wrong to fuel it. This is why I constantly advise the friends - government officials and the people whose statements are reflected in the entire country or part of the country - to watch their statements and to control their tongues.
A particular statement may not only fail to extinguish the fire of discord, but it may also fuel it.
Try to bring together and reunite those who have separated from Muslim communities. Try to bring back those who have almost drifted away. We must not let our behavior, words and actions discourage those who are partially faithful to the Islamic Republic.
We should improve the relationship between those who have problems with each other.
When it comes to revealing things about other people, we should only reveal their good characteristics.
If you know about a good thing that a person or a government official has done, that is what you should reveal about him.
There are many things that can be said in this regard.
What I said is only part of the dua. There were 22, 23 points in the dua and I only touched on 6, 7 of them.
We should ask God to "clothe us in the ornaments of the God-fearing".
These are some of the requirements of piety.
This is the end of the first part of my speech.
The second part of my speech is a general assessment of the conditions of the country.
The excellent and detailed report, which was presented by the honorable President, was very informative. There were outstanding points in the report and it is very good if these points are made public so that everybody knows what efforts have been made and what services have been rendered.
I will discuss the issues of the country from a different perspective, which is very important to us.
Why is it important?
Primarily because it is very important to know about general conditions of the country, where we have reached and which way we should go. These things are always important, but they are particularly important in the current situation because of the conditions of the world.
First of all, the conditions of the region are completely unprecedented.
Islamic Awakening and the great event that has taken place in the region have been absolutely unprecedented from the beginning of the Revolution up until today.
A great event has taken place. The fact that a nation like the Egyptian nation carries out such a great movement, overthrows the Egyptian regime and shouts Islamic slogans, the fact that the existence of the fake Jewish and Zionist government is threatened like this by the conditions of the region - these things are too great to fit in conventional assessments.
Well, these are the conditions and they promise very bright prospects for the Islamic Republic.
And the conditions of the world are also unprecedented. The big economic crisis which has plagued western arrogant powers is an extraordinary event and we cannot afford to treat it superficially.
The analyses that westerners present about the economic crisis in America and certain European countries and the warnings that they sound about the future, are only part of these issues. They are not saying everything.
Think tanks, backstage policy-makers and designers of global issues in powerful countries of the world - who have control over the majority of global media - do not want the dimensions of this crisis to be revealed to the people of the world, otherwise the dimensions of the crisis are far more serious than this.
By Allah's favor, if there is time, I will say a few sentences in this regard at the end of my speech.
Another issue is the emergence of radical movements and terrorist campaigns in the west, particularly in Europe - from European neo-Nazis to American neocons. The previous US government was neocon. These people openly announce their radical positions.
And then they attacked two Islamic countries.
They had other plans as well, but God did not give them time and they were defeated.
Well, these are important issues.
The event that happened in Norway should not be viewed as an isolated event.
In such conditions, we need to re-evaluate ourselves and see what our situation is.
If we fail to see these opportunities, if we fail to identify them, if we fail to use them appropriately, if we fail to use them at the right time, we will suffer losses.
Sometimes losing an opportunity becomes a threat in itself, a cause of backwardness.
For this reason it is not a bad idea to consider the issues of the country from a general perspective.
We must not deceive ourselves. We must not be biased. We have weaknesses and strengths and we need to see both of them.
They constantly promote pessimism in the media and elsewhere.
And as soon as one questions their approach, they say, "You are preventing us from telling the truth.
You call it pessimism and other such things, but we just want to state the facts." No, this is bias.
I usually skim through 10, 20 newspapers each day.
Certain newspapers publish 4, 5 headlines every day each of which is enough to fill the hearts of weak people with apprehension.
I will not accuse anybody. But this is a fact and it is wrong.
The same is true of the opposite.
This is wrong too. It is necessary to see both negative and positive points.
We need to take into consideration both what the government has managed to do and what it has failed to do.
Therefore, if we want to have an appropriate evaluation of the country's conditions, we need to see both positive and negative points.
Today I will just mention a point, but this issue requires a lot of work.
Positive points will show us the capacities that the country enjoys.
And the list of negative points will show us the priorities we should take care of.
If we compare these two lists, the path will become clear to us and we will realize what we should do.
I have written down 5, 6 things that are the result of the constant movement of the Islamic Republic over the past 32 years. Of course there have been ups and downs. That is to say, certain years and administrations have been good and certain other years and administrations have been less good, but generally these are the positive things that we have achieved over the past 32 years.
The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point.
Over the past 32 years we have encountered many threats - political threats, security threats, military threats, economic threats - which were supposed to harm the Islamic Republic.
Of course they wanted to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which proved to be impossible for them, so they tried to at least keep the Islamic Republic and Iran backward.
The Islamic Republic has overcome these threats.
Some of these threats were posed directly by foreigners, such as the sanctions.
Sanctions have been there for many years, but they have been intensified in the recent years. They themselves spoke about crippling sanctions.
They acted directly or used the United Nations - which was under their control - to impose these sanctions.
These were the threats in which foreigners were directly involved.
There were certain other threats - such as the issue of ethnicities in the country - which were caused by domestic factors although the enemy could have used these factors to his advantage. The Islamic Republic overcame all these threats. Today different ethnicities are living together in the country in a brotherly way.
I believe this is one of the most important strengths.
We should pay attention to this point when enumerating the strengths of the Islamic Republic.
The Islamic Republic has been faced with the enmity of the most powerful people in the world and it has been forced to deal with constant threats single-handedly for 32 years, but it has managed to overcome all these threats. This is a very important point.
I believe this is the most important strength of the Islamic Republic.
The second strength is the trust between the people and the Islamic Republic.
